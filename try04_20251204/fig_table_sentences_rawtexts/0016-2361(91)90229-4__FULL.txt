Table 3 shows that in all cases the API gravity and volatility of the product liquids were increased substantially over the native bitumen while the viscosity, Conradson carbon residue and pour point were markedly decreased.
The comparison of product distributions, yields and liquid product qualities for the fluidized bed and rotary kiln pyrolysis processes at similar temperatures and feed sand retention times are presented in Table 5.
Selected physical and chemical properties of the produced liquids from the fluidized bed and rotary kiln and native bitumen are presented in Tables 6 and 7.
This is based upon the yields of the gas oil and naphtha fractions of the produced liquids (Table 6) which indicate minimal secondary cracking of the gas oil fraction in the rotary kiln and significant cracking of the gas oil and distillate fractions in the fluidized bed.
CONCLUSIONS The process variable data obtained in this exploratory investigation indicated that rotary kiln pyrolysis could Table 7 Comparison of the quality of the liquid product obtained in the rotary kiln and fluidized bed reactors, Whiterocks tar sand Produced hydrocarbon liquids Properties Native bitumen Rotary kiln Fluidized bed Operating conditions Temperature (K) - 798 773-813 Solids retention time (min) - 13 17 Elemental analysis (wt%) Carbon 83.3 86.0 87,3 Hydrogen 11.0 11-3 10.6 Nitrogen 1.3 0.9 1.0 Sulphur 0.3 0.2 0.4 Oxygen 4.1 1.6 1.4 Atomic H/C ratio 1.58 1.58 1.46 Molecular weight (g mol"1) 402 - 318 1360 FUEL, 1991, Vol 70, November Pyrolysis of bitumen-impregnated sandstones: S.
