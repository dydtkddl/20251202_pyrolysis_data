A mixture of silica and carbon in the molar ratio of 1:1 was fed into a graphite crucible, kept in a plasma reactor (Fig.
A detailed study of the vibrational modes of the silanol group on the surface of silica collected from the differ- ent locations of the reactor (Fig.
The products collected from (a) in the vicinity of the arc and (b) from the wall of the reactor were found to be similar and show IR absorption peaks at 500, 800, 1120 and 3436 cnT' (Fig.
The powder collected from both the reactor tube and collection chamber shows an absorption peak at 944.6 cm"', typical of an isolated Si-OH group, along with absorption peaks at 1015, 1620, 3500 and 3720 cm'1 corresponding to Si-O-Si, OH group, geminal group ofSi(OH)2, and the OH (of the silanol group) respec- tively (Fig.
