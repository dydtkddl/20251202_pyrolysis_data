Classification and characterisation of sorbents According to the classification scheme of Kiselev [10,43], there are three classes of sor- bents (Table 1).
Only class I interacts non- specifically with all groups of adsorbates (Table 2).
The physico-chemical measure- Table 2 Classification of adsorbates Group Molecules Adsorbents Class I Class II and II1 A -Spherically symmetrical shells -~r-bonds Nonspecific interaction Dispersion forces C D -Electron density concentrated on bonds/links -~--bonds -( + )-Charge on peripheral links -Concentrated electron densities -( + )-Charge on peripheral links Nonspecific Nonspecific interaction + specific interaction 152 E.
The main types of carbon sorbents used for preconcentration of organic compounds and their further determination predominantly by GC and/or HPLC are listed in Table 3.

A comparison between the collec- tion efficiency of Carbopack B (graphitized car- bon black material, which is a relatively pure form of carbon [100]) and Tenax GC in the sampling of C6-C~0 hydrocarbons from both simulated and real atmospheres [87], indicates that Carbopack B is the more efficient sorbent (Fig.

Supelco produces several combinations of car- bon sorbents in multi-bed adsorbent tubes (Table 4), which should be effective for trapping volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds with a broad range in boiling points.

Various applications of multi-bed sorbents (combinations of carbonaceous and non-car- bonaceous sorbents) for sampling of organic compounds in air are summarised in Table 5.
From the listed papers in Table 5 the most important are considered to be the papers of Bishop and Valis [105] and Ciccioli et al.
