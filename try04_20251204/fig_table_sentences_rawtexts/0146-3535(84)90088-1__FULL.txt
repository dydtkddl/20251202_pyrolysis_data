The phase diagrams at 900 K, 1000 K and 1100 K, shown in Figs 1, 2, and 3, respectively, establish that AlSb can be grown from TMA-TMSb pyrolysis for given values of the partial pressures of Al, Sb and C in the vapor phase, however contaminated with A14C3 and C condensed phawes.
The phase diagrams for the TiBA-TMSb and TMA-TMSb systems at 900 K, shown in Figs 4 and 5, respectively (10), are similar and establish that the epitaxy of AlSh on latticematched GaSb substrates using TiBA permitted several improvements, i.e.

A schematic of the apparatus and its description, which is now universally employed by a large number of researchers for the growth of II-VI and III-V semiconductors, is given in Wang's 1978 review (6) and is reproduced here for illustration, Fig.

The nucleation begins with the formation of a large number of individual growth nuclei which at, or near, the annealing temperatures coalesce into large islands, Fig.
Figs 7-9 show SEMps of GaAs grown on (111) spinels just before complete coverage, the growth islands still being visible.
The films consequently improved and gave smoother appearance with the RED patterns showing the Kikuchi linee,.Fig.
