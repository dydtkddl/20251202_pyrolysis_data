EXPERIMENTAL Materials and equipment Hydrogation of the various non-coking coals whose properties are listed in Tables l and 2 was carried out in a stainless-steel, vertical fixed bed reactor of 155 ml ca- pacity13.
In the first series of experiments {Table 3) approximately 50-100 g of coal particles, having dimen- sions of 2.38-4.76 mm, were introduced into the reactor, and electrolytic hydrogen (99.9% purity) was passed up through the bed at 2.8 l min"1 at s.t.p.
The vapour-phase material leaving the reactor flowed to a high-pressure Table 1 Proximate and ultimate analyses of the coals used in these studies Oxidized Forestburg Phalen Can more Onakawana sub- Seam semi- (wt %) lignite bituminous bituminous anthracite Moisture 48.1 17.2 2.4 0.8 Ash 6.8 10.7 7.6 7.8 Volatile matter 21.4 31.1 32.2 13.4 Fixed carbon 23.7 41.0 57.8 78.0 Carbon 60.4 64.8 79.2 84.2 Hydrogen 3.9 4.0 5.0 3.7 Table 2 Dilatation properties of the original coals Oxidized Onaka- Forestburg Phalen Canmore mana sub- Seam semi- lignite bituminous bituminous anthracite Softening tem- perature, 9 s () <310 343 339 499 Maximum contrac- tion, C (%) 8 10 20 2 Temp.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Proximate analyses of the various non-coking coals used in the present work are given in Table 1.
Dilatation results and FSI's for these coals are given in Table 2 and reflect their non-coking characters.
The dilatation residue obtained from experi- ments with original Onakawana lignite did not show any coke structure (Figure 1).
The four coals listed in Table 1 were hydrogenated at the processing conditions listed in Table 3.
FSI and dilatation results for the hydrogenated residues {Table 3) were found to improve considerably over those of the original coals.

Evidence for the formation of mesophase spherical structures from non-coking coals during thermal hy- drogation is shown in Figure 2-4.
Spheres are readily apparent in Figure 2 (hydrogenated lignite), Figure 3 (hydrogenated subbituminous coal) and in Figure 4 (hydrogenated coking coal which had been oxidized).
In contrast, the hydrogenated semi-anthracite in Figure 5 has a flow-type structure.
The dilatation residue obtained from experi- ments with hydrogenated semi-anthracite was found to have the same structure as that of the hydrogenated residue [Figure 5) suggesting that it had been partially converted to coke during the hydrogation experiment.
This was further confirmed by the lack of contraction or dilatation in the case of hydrogenated residue from semi- anthracite (Table 3).
In principle, the improved coking properties of the hydrogenated residues shown in Table 3, compared to the Figure 5 Flow-type coke structure in Canmore semi-anthracite hydrogenated for 3 h at 450 and 13.9 MPa; FS, flow type; UV, unreacted vitrinite FigureG Optical micrograph of the dilatation residue from hydro- genated Onakawana lignite; CG, coarse grain coke structure FUEL, 1981, Vol 60, April 349 Conversion of non-coking coals to coking coals: B.
original coals shown in Table 2, could be caused either by the high mechanical pressure or by the chemical influence of the hydrogen.
Measurements of all of the quantities in Table 3 showed no changes from the original coal.
The microstructure of the solids obtained from the high-pressure nitrogen experiments was the Figure 7 Optical micrograph of the dilatation residue from hydro- genated Forestburg coal; UV, unreacted vitrinite; F, fusinite Figure 8 Micrograph of the dilatation residue from the hydro- genated product made from oxidized Phalen Seam coal; 0V, oxidized vitrinite; C, coke formation same as the original coal, that is, similar to the structure shown in Figure I.
The effects of processing conditions are shown in Tables 4-7 and in Figures 9-11.
As shown in Figure 9, with increasing hydrogen pressure, up to 15 MPa, the liquid yield increased (the point at the highest pressure used is ignored as it is considered to be a rogue result), the solid yield decreased, and the coking tendencies of the hy- drogenated residues increased (Tables 4 and 7).
The microstructure of the hydrogenated residues changed: flow type at 13.9 MPa (Figure 72), coarse grain mozaic at 6.9 MPa (Figure 13), fine grain mosaic at 3.5 MPa (Figure 14} and isotropic at 0,79 MPa (Figure 15).
As the temperature increased, the liquid yield (Figure 10} and the coking properties (Table 5} went through a maximum while the solid yield (Figure 10} went through a minimum.
The vaporization of these materials causes the increase in liquid and decrease in solid yield shown in Figure 10.

As the reaction time increased, the liquid yield increased (Figure 11}, the solid yield decreased (Figure II), and the coking properties (dilatation) went through a maximum (Table 6).
The improvement in coking characteristics of Forestburg and Phalen Seam coals with increasing hy- drogen pressure and reaction time (Tables 4 and 7) was accompanied by decreasing oxygen content (Table 8 and 9) of the hydrogenated residue.
The oxygen content is definitely decreased by hydrogation as shown in Tables 8 and 9.

The data in Tables 7 and 8 certainly show a correlation between the develop- ment of coking properties and oxygen removal.
