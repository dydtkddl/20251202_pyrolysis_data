PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE SELECTED REACTIONS We report on Table 1 some thermochemical data of the considered reactions.

The whole set of rate constants is given in Table 2.
The values of rgo, the mean residence time required to obtain 90% of equilibrium concentrations, are plotted ver- sus temperature in Fig.

The quenching nozzles are placed close to the outlet of the dissociation reactor, perpendic- ularly to the hot gas stream (Figs.
With the help of previous studies[231, two kinds of dissocia- tion reactors were designed (Fig.

Typical values of temperatures are reported in Table 3.
All gases but nitric oxide are analysed by gas phase chromatography using a catharometer detec- tor: H2, 02, N2 and CO are separated through a 5-,& molecular sieve column; CO2 and steam are detected after separation through a Porapak-Q Table 3.
In previous papers[18, 26], we pointed out that the amount of hydrogen expressed as the molar fraction of hydrogen XH= or as the volumetric flow- rate of hydrogen QH,, was an increasing function of the quenching flowrate (Fig.
By contrast, in the case of carbon dioxide dissociaton, the composition of products is very little affected by QBo except for very weak quenching flowrates corresponding to a laminar re- gime inside the quenching nozzles and a less effi- cient mixing (Fig.

Molar fractions of H2, CO and NO diminish as Qm increases (Figs.
6a-c), owing to a compensation effect; the net volumetric production, which is the product of the massic flowrate by the reaction ex- tent, slightly increases up to a maximum value Q~ax corresponding to Q~aX after which it quickly diminishes (Figs.
Obviously, the best results are obtained with an annular type reactor (Figs.

Obviously, flowrates of produced hydrogen in- crease with the available power (Fig.

The rate of chemical reactions is described by the kinetic mechanism exposed above (see Table 2).

Such a quench corresponding to a cooling rate close to l06 k s- 1 seems to be efficient for nitric oxide or carbon monoxide production, but it is still insufficient for hydrogen which partly disappears during cooling (Fig.
How- ever, the performance of our process could be largely increased by a better design of dissociation Solar reactor for high-temperature reactions 165 Efficiency V2Na+ V202 ~ NO C02 - C0+'/202 0.7 0.6 0.5 H20 "-" H2 + I/:,Oz 0.1 I Cooling rate(Ks-') Oil , , -- 105 10i 107 Fig.
