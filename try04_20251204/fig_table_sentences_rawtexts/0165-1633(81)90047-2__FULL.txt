A simplified solar spectrum with two superimposed black body spectra is shown in fig.
This figure provides the relationship between wavelength and incident flux for a given air mass.
The optimum heat mirror would act to transmit both high energy solar and near-infrared to approximately a wavelength of 2 #m, as shown in fig.
Examples of this type are shown in fig.
A heat mirror of this type must have the basic property shown in fig.
This coating allows visible energy to be transmitted through the window, while the majority of all infrared including that of the sun is reflected away from the building, as shown in fig.

A figure of merit might be g/Wp, where wp is the plasma frequency or transition frequency.
Another figure of merit might be urn*, where a high product would favor minimum visible absorption and maximum conductivity.

Highly conducting films have been obtained with metal excess compositions (shown in fig.
Examples of these films are shown in fig.
These results are shown in fig.
By increasing film conductivity, transparency is improved, which is contrary to expectations (see fig.
