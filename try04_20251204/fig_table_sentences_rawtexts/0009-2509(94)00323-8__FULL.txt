The applied values of the reactor and catalyst parameters are shown in Table 3.
Table 4 presents typical values of the heat and mass transport parameters as evaluated from the correlations men- tioned above.
5.1 Pellet scale Figure 1 shows, for pellet diameters of 0.25 mm and 2 mm, the concentration profiles in the catalyst for oxygen and methyl radicals, as obtained by integra- tion of the pellet-scale balances, eqs (1 5) ( 18).
Figure 1 clearly indicates the relevance of the radical gradients with respect to the absolute concentration level; the rate of reaction steps involving radicals will change drasti- cally along the pellet coordinate, while steps not involving radicals are almost unaffected.
The lower oxygen concentra- tion inside the catalyst pellet leads to a lower local Dimensionless pellet coordinate / Fig.
The same phenomena appear in Fig.
Figure 2 shows the pellet-scale selectivity towards C2 products as a func- tion of the pellet diameter.
Figure 2 also shows by extrapolation to a pellet diameter of zero that a pseudohomogeneous reactor model would predict a selectivity which would be 10% too low, emphasizing the need for a heterogeneous fixed bed reactor model.

The ratio of C2 formation to C0~ formation is favoured by high temperatures, because of an increased radical fonnation at high temperatures and a hardly activated catalytic oxida- tion of methyl radicals, see Table 1.
