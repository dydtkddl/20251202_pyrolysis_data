In order to prevent breakage of the front win- dow of the chamber due to thermal stress, a quartz plate is placed between this window and the IR lamPS (Fig.
In order to limit emission of radiation from the quartz plate, it is cooled by the cooling coil and an air jet (not shown on Fig.

The elemental composition of pure cellulose is given in Table 1 for convenience, and the composition of the chars is tabulated in Table 2 as a function of the amount of retardant in the original sample YR" The resulting elemental composition of the total volatiles is given in Table 3.
A major effect of the retardant is to increase the char mass fraction Ych, and this leads to the reduction in carbon content of the volatiles with increasing retardant addition shown in Table 3.
The results are given in Table 4 and show a significantly higher carbon content for the combustible volatiles than was found for the (total) volatiles.

The carbon content of the combustible volatiles varies with retardant concentration; its maximum value is 75% at YR = 0.015.
The composition results in Table 4 are now used to calculate values for x, y, and z in Eq.

Many of the results attained in this article are summarized in Fig.

Figure 21 shows the major groups of pyrolysis products obtained from a unit mass of retarded cellulose.
