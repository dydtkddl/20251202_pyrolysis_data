RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The samples in this study are listed in Tables i and 2 with a summary of various parameters obtained for each sample.
Lipids in Surface Samples f r o m Sites 474, 477 to 479, and 481 Examples of n-alkane distributions from these sites are shown in Figs 6-8, and the hydrocarbon yields, CPI and Pr/Ph data are plotted in Figs 2-5 (CPI = carbon preference index; Cooper and Bray (1963); Pr/Ph = pristane-to-phytane ratio; Didyk et al.
Figs 6 and 7) range from Ct2 to C35, with maxima at Cxg, C22 and C29, and a strong odd-to-even carbon-number predominance >C24.
The predominance of n-nonadecane (n-C19; Figs 6 and 7) may indicate an unaltered, primary bacterial residue.
Phytane is the predominant isoprenoid hydrocarbon (Pr/Ph < 1; Figs 2 and 3) and varying amounts of sulfur and perylene are also present, indicating partially euxinic paleoenvironmental conditions of sedimentation (Didyk et al., 1978).
Examples of m/z 191 mass chromatograms are shown in Fig.

Typical examples of various mass chromatograms are shown in Fig.

For example, the ring C monoaromatic steranes (m/z 253, Fig.
10c) are present at significant concentrations, as are the triaromatic steranes (suggested structure XV, m/z 231, Fig.
Fig.
Tetrapyrole pigments are the most sensitive indicators for the thermal history of sedimentary organic matter (Baker and Louda, 1982, 1983) and the trend is illustrated for Site 477 in Fig.
Some examples of this depletion trend are shown in Fig.
HYDROTHERMAL EFFECTS OF INTRUSIONS ON LIPIDS Site 477 The hydrocarbon yields, CPI, Pr/Ph ratios and n-alkane distributions for selected samples from Site 477 are shown in Figs 2 and 6, respectively.
The differences in hydrocarbon distributions (Fig.
Near the sill a thermogenic component appears, which shows no carbon number predominance and ranges from C20 to C33, with a maximum at C25 (Fig.

Minor amounts of 1713(H)hopanes (II, 1713) remain and triterpenes are not detectable or are found only in trace amounts (Figs 9d and 9e).
As is the case for the shallow immature samples, the C27 (marine origin) steranes predominate in the thermally-altered samples, with a significant amount of the 513(H) stereomers (XIII, R = H, 513) and similar distributions of other analogs as described above (Fig.

However, at about 5 cm (or 3.5 m; sample 481A-144, 52-54 cm; Table 1) above the sill, the hydrocarbon distribution is heavily altered.
Samples below the major sill complex, and more than 50 m above the minor sills at depth have distributions of n-alkanes which are essentially identical (Fig.
