Kinematic viscosities of the solvent (0.10 M acetic acid and 0.20 M NaCI) and a number of chitosan solutions (5-10) of variable concentration (0.1-0.5 g/L) were measured at 25.0 + 0.05°C with an Ubbelohde dilution capillary viscometer [26], The measured characteristics of the chitosan samples are summarized in Table 1.

Thus, values of kc can be determined from experimental values of k and kN, as summarized in Table 3.
Thus, the value of kc includes the effect of the concentration of chitosan amine groups, as suggested in Fig.
This is verified in Fig.

Although the effect of copolymer composition on the observed rate constant, k0, was established in Fig.
Values of the pKa of the amine groups on chitosan (extrapolated to 100% amine protonation to mimic reaction conditions) are shown in Fig.

Experimental values of ko/KA are listed in Table 4 for chitosan samples with four different copolymer compositions, and the relative reactivity of the chitosan amine groups with H2NO~ is shown in Fig.
A basis for this dramatic change in amine reactivity is suggested by the data in Fig.
