Experimental conditions for pyrolysis of shredded waste tires in the present study are hsted in Table 2.
The effect of feed rate of waste tires (0.21-0.52 kg/h) on the product-gas composition from the pyrolysis of waste tires is shown in Fig.
The feed rate was maintained constant at 0.32 kg/h to prevent tar formation Effect of oxygen concentration The production rates of various gas components at different oxygen concentrations are shown in Fig.
The production rates of C2H6 and c3n6 do not change with variations Table 2 Experimental condmons for pyrolysts of shredded waste tires.

Effect of pyrolysis temperature The effects of pyrolysis temperature on gas yield and on char and oil produced on a dry, ash-free basis are shown in Fig.
The effects of temperature on the production rates of gases from pyrolysis of waste tires are shown in Fig.
As can be seen, the production rates of H2 and CI-I4 increase but C3 components decrease Pyrolyms of waste tires 973 "o "6 70 60 50 40 30 20( 10 I i I I I 0 2 4 6 8 10 o2c,~ e/,) 0.5 i0.4 03 f 0.2 ~ 0.1 ' 0.0 12 14 Fig 4 Effect of O~ concentraUon on gas yield and energy recovery (800, 0 32 kg/h, 2 5 u.,,t) 60 50 o~ 40 m o 30 20 0 Gas n 011 z~ Char I [ I 1 I 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 Temp (oC) Ftg 5 Effect of pyrolyms temperature on gas, od and char yields (0 32 kg/h, 2 5 u,,,t, 6.5% 02) Fig 6 8 80 60 40 20 0 650 v CH~ / o C3I-~ , 700 750 800 850 900 950 Temp (2) Effect of pyrolysis temperature on gas-production rate (0.32 kg/h, 2 5 urn, 6.5% 02) EGY 20/10-8 974 Jong Min Lee et al with pyrolysis temperature.
The heating values of the product gases and energy recovery from pyrolysis of tires as a function of reaction temperature are shown in Fig.
Effect of gas velocity The effects of gas velocity on the gas-production rates from pyrolysis of waste tires are shown in Fig.
Energy recovery does not change appreciably at the given fluidizing gas velocity since the decrease of gas yield compensates for the increase of heating value of the product gas (Fig.
