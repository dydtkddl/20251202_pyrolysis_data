MEASUREMENTS WITH CELLULOSE POWDER AND PARTICLES The olefin: paraffin ratio is plotted in Fig.
The acetylene: ethane and butadiene: butane ratios also appear in Fig.

A fit of the curves in this figure provides values whose ratio will be the average of the data in Fig.
Symbols in the figures identify the pyrolysis device, the cellulose form (either MCP or CP) and the operating conditions used; these are given in Table 1.

A fit of the yield data in Fig.
The figure shows that a butene yield of just under 1% of sample weight is possible for complete cellulose conversion in a fluidized bed pyrolyzer.

Measurements for the higher hydrocarbons gave results similar to Fig.

It cannot be attributed to the pyrolysis device because a separation between the fluidized bed and coil pyrolyzer data is not seen for the propene-propane data in Fig.
Indeed, if the pyrolyzer were the source, the good agreement of the CZ data in Fig.
