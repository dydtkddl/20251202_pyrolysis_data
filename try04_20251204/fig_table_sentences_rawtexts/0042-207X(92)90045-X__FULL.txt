This can be realized by an rf-field near the substrate's, by passing the oxygen through a microwave cavity' ", or by employing ozone"-' These techniques attain such a high degree of complication that few cases are known to work successfully (Figure 1)'5.
In this case, a quadrupole mass spectrometer has been used for rate OZ inlet Quartz balance Substrate Cone Pump e-beam evaporat< Knudsen cell Figure I.
Alternatively, the substrate can be placed outside the plasma ring at a suitable angle, such as at 90(refs 48, 62, 63), or in the inverted cylindrical magnetron (ICM) sputtering apparatus (Figure 2)36,"7,64,65.

A plume of constituents is ejected from the target and impinges on the substrate (Figure 3).
