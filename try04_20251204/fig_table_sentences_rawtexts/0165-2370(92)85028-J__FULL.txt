DATA INTERPRETATION Flow regime in the reactor For extreme values of the main flow rate and temperature investigated, the corresponding Reynolds numbers vary between 8 and 42 (Table 3).
The controlling parameters are the Peclet number, which compares convection and radial molecular diffusion: Pe = u ,d/2D (1) and the Damkohler II number, which compares reaction to radial molecular diffusion: a = kd2/4D (2) A rough estimate based on the molecular diffusivity D (T;1 atm) = 10-5 (T/273)'-a mz s-' yields a Peclet number ranging between 6 and 32 (Table 3).
However, with anticipated values of k derived from the plug-flow assumption, k ranges between 4.7 x 10-3 and 0.42 s-', and the Damkohler number may be as low as 1.6 x 10-3 (Table 3).
Table 1 shows the results of two experiments at 843 K and t = 4.8 s: the first one is done with crude TPIC, while the second one is done after a 2.5 h preheating of TPIC in the boiler at 423 K in a stream of dry nitrogen.

Table 2 reports typical results obtained at three temperatures where no TPIC is detected, i.e.
