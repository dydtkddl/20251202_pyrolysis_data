The traditional version of thermochemical-nuclear technology, widely known as the EVA-ADAM scheme, is based on a high-temperature helium-cooled nuclear reactor and includes three loops (Fig.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ICAR METHOD The ICAR method is based on a combination of both nuclear and catalytic reactors in the same technological volume by loading the catalyst directly into the active (energy releasing) zone of the nuclear reactor (Fig.
Two main variations of this approach can be suggested: (1) The catalytic and heat releasing elements (nuclear fuel or radioactive heat-producing isotopes) are independent chemical and functional units (Fig.
2a); (2) The two mentioned elements are combined not only in the same volume but also in the same physicochemical structure, thus accomplishing the functions of the nuclear fuel and the catalyst simultaneously; obviously, this struc- ture has to be based on the uranium (thorium, plutonium or other splitting or radioactive heat-producing elements) chemical compounds (Fig.

The main characteristics of the energy conversion pro- cess, namely specific power loading co and energetic effi- ciency, -,7, were calculated with an accuracy of about 20% using the chromatographic data on dry product mixture composition [6] and standard thermodynamic tables [ 11 ] : ~o = W~hlVc and r/ = WchlW,.~, where Wch is the enthalpy change (for the cooled reaction mixture) in the course of the energy accumulating reaction (per unit time) and V, is the volume of the catalyst inside the reactor.
Results and discussion In order to elucidate the mechanism and main regularities of energy-accumulating catalytic reactions under intensive ionizing radiation, we investigated the dependencies of specific power loading w and efficiency rl, as well as the rate of hydrogen formation, rh, upon the average (over the whole catalyst volume) value of h, the conversion, x, of the (o) f ~'~ 5O .~~ I E o 30 i I I I 50 60 90 120 (b) f3 (W cm-3) 50 2 ~ 3e I I~01 I I 60 I I 901 I I 1 201 I I (W crff3) Fig.
If~ > p*, the specific power loading ~0 of all reactions under study increases linearly with the increase of b (Fig.
Some results of experimental study of reactions (1)-(3) under intensive electron beam radiation are presented in Table 1.
They demonstrate that all the reactions tested are ICAR PROCESS FOR CHEMINUCLEAR POWER PLANTS 51 Table 1.
For example, the functions of the specific power loading and efficiency on the reagent conversion x have very smooth maxima at x --- 40%-60%, 50%-80% and 50%-60% for reactions (1), (2) and (3), respectively (Fig.
In spite of these compen- sation phenomena we have however recorded a correlation between the rate of reaction and the activity of catalysts used (see Table 1 and Ref.

For example, if we increase the rate of the reagent feeding, the catalyst temperature can drop rapidly (to = 10 s) by 150-300 (Fig.

Above this temperature, a sintering of porous uranium oxide was observed which leads to a decrease in the surface area of the samples (Fig.
It turned out that maximum activity corresponds with a content of 0.8 and 9-10 wt% for Ru and Ni catalysts, respectively, and can achieve 17-18 normal cm3 of hydrogen formed per second per gram of the catalyst tested (Fig.
The kinetics of this reaction is found to obey the relation (Fig.

Under steady-state conditions, the heat balance in a small volume of the energy converting reactor can be written as (Fig.
\,l Fig.
It turned out (see dashed lines in Figs 4 and 5) that the suggested model closely described the ther- mocatalytic energy conversion in the chemical reactor with an intensive energy supply (release) directly inside the 56 YU.
As was mentioned previously, one of the most efficient ways to increase the specific power loading ~0 of energy conversion is by raising the intensity p of heat release (supply) into the catalyst bed (see Fig.
Figure 12 shows that the dependencies o:(p) calculated at the fixed methane conver- sions x can be approximated as oJ(p) - p', where the expo- nent ~, is changed from 0 to 1 being equal to one at x -> 0.5.
Near linear increase of o: with p [this dependence was also recorded experimentally (Fig.
6)] is accompanied by a rise in the maximum temperature Tm in the catalyst bed (Fig.

Figure 13 gives the dependencies of the specific power loading and the maximum catalyst temperature upon the value of x at different intensities of heat release.
Figure 14 shows the values of which could be achieved if the catalysts of the GIAP-3-6N or 0.8% Ru/UO2 types had different thermal stability.
High thermal stability of the catalyst used is also of great importance for providing the necessary safety of operation in the case of an unexpected emergency rise of temperature inside the cheminuclear ICAR PROCESS FOR CHEMINUCLEAR POWER PLANTS 57 20o[ E o I00 2 3 ~ 60 3 8OO 7OO 0.2 ~4 0.6 Q8 I.O A i (o) (I)x =0.2 (2) x =0.5 (3)x =0.63 \ (4)x=0.8 I 2 Fig.

In spite of the intuitive expectations, at p = constant, the rate of the catalytic reaction and the specific power loading depend upon this factor rather weakly (Fig.
Nevertheless, the use of more active catalysts allows us to decrease con- siderably the temperature inside the catalyst bed (Fig.
The optimal pressure is about 3-7 atm (Fig.
The variation of the pressure is able to enhance the value of ~ only by a factor of 1.5; however, this is accompanied by a considerable decrease of the temperature of the catalyst (Fig.

The results of such calculations are given in Fig.
For instance, if reaction (1) is far from equilibrium for the given temperature and, thus, the influence of the back reaction of methanation may be neglected, then specific power loading is decreased by increasing the depth of methane conversion x (Fig.
18), the value of 00 grows linearly as catalyst activity and/or total pressure rises (Figs 19 and 20).
The dependence ~0(T) is defined mainly by the common Arrhenius term exp(-Ea/RT), where activation energy E, describes the temperature dependence of reaction rate (see curve 3' in Fig.

Under conditions close to the equilibria, the noticeable decreases of reaction rate and, hence, of specific power loading were observed to be influenced by back reaction of methanation, and the dependencies ~0(x) and ~o(P0) became more complicated (Figs 18 and 20).
