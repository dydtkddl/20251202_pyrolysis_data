The effect of an etching component ensuring the selective growth of DF my be illustrated by a schematic diagram shown in Fig.
The simultaneous effect of the etching component leads to the resultant diamond growth rate (taking into account the etching of diamond) proving to be positive, while the growth of graphite becomes totally impossible (Fig.

Concludinst Remarks In addition to the remarks on the double-beam method in Section 2.3.5, the following should be noted: some of the existing methods of deposition of DLF from medium-energy carbon ions (see Table 1) are characterized by high efficiency (deposition rate, and area of specimens coated).
Table 1 does not include the energy of the particles from which the deposition of DLF takes place, since in the course of determination of the actual value of the energy not only the voltage applied to the substrate but also the presence of a charge on the surface will have to be accounted for.
The data for the research work on the preparation of DF by sublimation of graphite and implantation of carbon ions are not included in Table 1, since the principal parameters of processes and their efficiency are difficult to compare with those of the method listed.

It should also be noted that for growing diamond under a pressure lower than 1 atm and at a temperature of about 1000 tetrahalogeno-urethanes (75) have been used in addition to hydrocarbons, and also carbon monoxide mixed with carbon dioxide and hydrogen, (147) carbonyls of the metals of the V-VII groups of the Periodic Table (49) and organometallic compounds, alkyl derivatives of the metals of the II-V groups of the Periodic Table.

Table 2 compares the basic experimental principles and some parameters of the DF growing processes using different methods of chemical crystallization considered in Sections 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5.
Comparison of the properties of the DF obtained by two recent methods with the properties of natural diamond (see Table 3), demonstrates that practically all the properties of the gas-phase diamond films examined are close to the corresponding properties of so-called nitrogen-free diamond of type He.

To conclude the consideration of the experimental methods of this Section, we give Table 4, including additional data that are required for qualitative and quantitative comparisons of some of those methods.
The data presented in Table 4 show that a number of RF deposition methods, judging from their principal technical parameters (e.g.
deposition rate and substrate surface area), prove to be very effective, and differ from the majority of the suggested methods of deposition of DLF from carbon atoms and ions (see Table 2) in the productive capacity and relative simplicity of the provision of units and their operation.
The most striking characteristics of gas phase methods are a considerable reduction in pressure in the processes of crystallization of DF and deposition MY (by 5-12 orders of magnitude), and W Table 4.

Some of the methods described in Sections 2, 3 and 4 (see also Tables 1, 2 and 4) may be used as the basis of a number of processes of industrial significance (see Section 6.8) 4.6.

(40, 46, 187) The only difference lies in the appearance of forbidden reflections (Table 5) which occur in the diffraction patterns from a lattice under stress.

The DF are single crystal, and produce the characteristic Kikuchi-line pattern when examined by the HEED method (Fig.
However, the pure (undoped) IF possess a crystal lattice parameter which is not identical with that of natural diamond (see Table 3), and may contain some intrinsic stress.
(12), the density of condensate at first increases, attains some fixed value exceeding the density of diamond by 14%, and then decreases as the mean energy of the ions increases (Fig.

Figure 21 represents the main results obtained by Myerson and Smith on the electrical conductivity of semiconductor DLF which they prepared.
A further increase in the boron doping level leads to an increase in conductivity at room temperature compared with that of pure DLF, by 5 and 4 orders of magnitude at deposition temperatures of 150 and 250 respectively (Figs 21.1 and 21.2).

The experimental data on the coefficient of optical adsorption of carbon films (Fig.
The largest absorption, which depends only to a relatively small degree on the photon energy, is shown by the films produced by laser evaporation of graphite (Fig.
Less absorption and its more pronounced increase with the photon energy are observed in the DLF produced by laser evaporation of diamond (Fig.
22.2) The absorption of diamond-like films obtained by hydrocarbon plasmolysis is even less (Fig.
The absorption throughout the whole spectrum under consideration however, considerably exceeds the optical absorption of diamond single crystals (Fig.
A relatively small absorption depending only a little on the photon energy (Fig.
(25) are exceptions, according to which the fundamental band of absorption of DLF about 20-100 nm thick in the UV spectrum lies at 200-250 which is consistent with the data for natural diamond single crystals and with those for DF (see Table 3).
(173) The absorption edge of epitaxial films about 1-2 um thick, grown on nitrogen-free diamond films, is approximately 225 ran (see Table 3), that is, it coincides with the adsorption edge of nitrogen-free, natural diamond of type He.
According to the data of Tables 2 and 4, a number of the deposition methods described in Sections 2 and 4 are efficient enough for developing corresponding commercially acceptable processes.
