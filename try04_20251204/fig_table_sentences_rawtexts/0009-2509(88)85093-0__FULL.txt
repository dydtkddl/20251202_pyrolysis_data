To take the maximum controllable step, a raster is constructed in the furnace (Fig.
For the furnace and conditions referred to in Table 1, a burner cup temperature of 1494 K is calculated from the energy balance (4).
From this A1 A2 Fig.
To reduce the required computer storage capacity, the contributions of the different bands to the radiative heat exchange are added up according to their weight in the Planck distribution (Fig.
A fraction of this energy is ab Coupled simulation of heat transfer and reactton Table 1.

The flue gas velocity induced by one burner at a particular point in the furnace is calculated as shown in Fig.
For a point located inside the cone (zone I in Fig.

Figure 5 gives a simplified flow chart of the calculations.
The main characteristics of the furnace and the reactor are given in Table 1.
A schematical represen- tation of the coil configuration and the subdivision into zones is given in Fig.
In Fig.
Consequently, the heat flux along the cracking coil varies considerably with the axial coordinate (Fig.
