A process flow diagram of the fluidized-bed reactor system is presented in Figure 1.
The pyrolysis liquids were collected in the recovery train (Figure I) using water-cooled strainers and traps.
The pressures in a traditional `Push' reactor are contrasted with this `Pull' reactor design in Figure 2.

Product distribution and yields Product distribution and yield data from experiments with material balances in excess of 90-93% based on bitumen-feed to the reactor in the targeted temperature range are presented in Table I.
The product distribution, liquids, gases and coke appeared to be insensitive to pyrolysis temperatures below 748 K based on the data in Table I.
Examination of the product distributions presented in Table I suggests that for the conditions used in this study, the solids retention time was not a significant variable.
The data in Table I indicate that the pyrolysis of the White rocks oil sand in the temperature range 723-748 K would be expected to give a product slate which consists of 88 wt% liquids, 9 wt% coke and 3 wt% gases.
The product distribution obtained in this study is compared with those obtained in a fluidized bed' and rotary kiln' 5,16 in Table 2.
analysis of the products is the water condensate found in the product recovery system (Figure I).
The gas compositions at different pyrolysis temperatures are summarized in Table 3.
It should also be noted in Table 3 that no CS or C6 gases were found in the gas when U/Umr was 2.

Liquid product specific gravities are given in Table 5 4 as a function of pyrolysis temperature.
In this work, however, the specific gravity trends (Table 5) suggest an absence of aromatization and/or dealkylation reactions.
Lower aromaticity would also be consistent with the low coke (Table 1) yields from the experiments.
The calculated simulated distillation cuts for the combined liquid products are plotted as a function of pyrolysis temperature in Figure 4.
