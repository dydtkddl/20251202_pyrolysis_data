The optical reflection spectrum (fig.
Quantum chemical calculations with the extended Hiickel model have led to detailed information about the interaction of Ag, and Cu atoms as well as Ag~^ and Cu4' ion clusters with the zeolite cavities of the 4/4, 6/6 subunits, 1000 WAVELENGH 1500 [nm] Fig.

Polyethylene Merck p.A., spectroscopic quality, 0.5% in KBr, is used as reference, fig.
The infrared spectrum shows the six main bands of polyethylene slightly shifted (less than 1 wavenumber) in comparison to the reference substance (fig.
