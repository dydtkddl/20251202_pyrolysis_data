Table 1 shows how these elements are distributed in various steam-raising fuels and summarizes their contribution to slagging, fouling, and corrosion.
Slagging is defined as deposition of fly ash on heat-transfer surface and refractory in the furnace volume primarily subjected to radiant heat transfer, illustrated in Fig.
Fouling is defined as deposition in the heat-recovery section of the steam generator subject to convective heat exchange by fly ash quenched to a temperature below its predicted melting point, condensation by volatiles, or sulfidation by SOs, as shown in Fig.

182 other investigators had examined the fusibility of ash based on eight fundamental oxides most frequently found in coal ash (i.e., SiO*, A1203, TiOz, FezOs, CaO, MgO, NazO, and K20) prior to 1981.Since that time at least 17 additional correla- tions have been developed between ash chemistry and the ASTM ash fusion temperatures in order to improve the reliability of predicting the melting temperature of coal ash.3 The 11 most frequently used are reported in Table 2.3%6 Figure 2 illustrates the ash fusibility expressed in terms of the ash chemistry.
Details of the terms, procedures, and accuracies have been described in a recent ASME publication.Table 3 compares the criteria for determining the various stages of melting used in the various international procedures.

This method of determination is reportedly applicable to slags in which 20% of the iron present is in the ferric state.6 The conceptual relationship between the ASTM softening tempera- ture and the critical viscosity has led others to modify earlier regression analyses of ash softening tempera- ture vs basicity of the coal ash by simply substituting critical viscosity for ash softening temperature.30.3 Coreyshowed the relationship between the soft- ening temperature and critical viscosity over a limited range of coals in Fig.

Growth of the paper and wood products industry and a need for process steam provided the incentive for adapting wood waste to stoker-fired steam generators, as illustrated in Fig.
The ash in wood is generally very low (running about l&3%) as shown in Table 21.

as low-temperature ashing (LTA) at <25O, thermo- gravimetric analysis on LTA at variable tem- peratures, and high-temperature ashing at lOOO, summarized in Table 24, has taught us that certain components are lost continuously as the temperature increases and are responsible for the unaccounted for.
A typical analysis by chemical fractionation of olive pits in Table 25 at room temperature indicates potassium is organically bound, whereas sodium is predominantly tied up as a silicate.

If this occurs in the gas stream, nucleation produces submicron particles that are subsequently agglomerated or scavenged by larger fly ash, shown in Fig.
Depending upon time and temperature, the potassium sulfate may also deposit directly on a tube surface, creating a low-melting sticky surface, shown in Fig.

Steam Generator Design and Field Experience To overcome slagging and fouling by low-melting fly ash and large concentrations of volatile alkalis in the presence of SOS and Cl, a folded furnace design is used consisting of a radiant chamber in series with a convective chamber, illustrated in Fig.
Jenkins et al.236 report that a white, reflective, porous scale, similar to that shown in Fig.
