The overall accept- abifity of different offshore concepts shown, in ranked order, in table 1, indicates the floating deep concept to be the most favourable one among the offshore con- cepts.
Based on a comparative study conducted on five different concepts, namely (i) floating ship-form hull; Table 1 Concept total acceptability values, reproduced from ref.

One criterion suggested by Bretschneider [53] is the value HL2/h2, where His the wave height, L is the wave length, and h is the water depth, which enables a choice between sinusoidal, conoidal and solitary wave theories as shown in fig.
Their choice depends on water depth, wave height and wave period as shown in fig.
[55] calculated the wave force components on a semi-submersible using the folio- wing relations: F1 = ~'Vti (Froude-Krylov), F2 = CmfV(gt - Yc) (inertia), (6) (7) and F3 = 0.5 ~CDA(U - .~)lu - ;I (8) Httnd 8RI:AKING WAVE HEIGHT (Hb) ~10 - It * STILL WATER DEPTH IN METRES Z0 I I__L I I S II 1 ix2"// 'Z/Z/_.---t"- f I J..-L---d"'o- I i 1- I t , ~ h*3Sm t h,30~ l0 WAVl[ PIRIOOS |met) IS Fig.

Har- low and Kehnemuyi [111 ] have investigated the feasi- bility of axial strut mooring systems connected to a mooring caisson for AGS and have concluded that the concept, shown in fig.
[7] are (i) pipe type cables suit- able for short distances; (ii) oil filled cables, insulated by oil impregnated paper (Fig.
14a); (iii) gas filled cables, insulated by inert gas like nitrogen; and (iv) solid di-electric cables, insulated by extruded poly- ethylene (fig.

These areas can be estimated from new axes, parallel to the original axes, the origin of which is the intersection of the righting moment curve and the inclining moment curve due to steady wind (fig.
Foundation analysis The differences between marine foundations and those on land, as listed by McDowell and Holmes [213], are: (i) saturated soils; (ii) more difficult and expensive soil exploration; (iii) sediments affected by movement due to waves and currents; (iv) eccen- tric and inclined dynamic loading due to waves; (v) M Mo Jncllning moment due Lo steady w;nd Inclining moment due to a gust Righting moment eo et" Fig.
