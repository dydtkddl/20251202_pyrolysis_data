284 EXPERIMENTAL Apparatus A schematic diagram of the pyrolysis system is shown in Fig.
The general composition of Al-Zahdi date stones was determined using standard methods of analysis and the results are given in Table 1.
The physico-chemical characteristics of the date-stone oils are listed in Table 2.
The furnace had been Fig 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Thermograuimetric analysis The TG and DTG curves of Al-Zahdi date stones are shown in Fig.
Fig.
Under the oxidative atmosphere of air, the main features of the TG and DTG curves were retained, whilst the characteristic temperature tended towards lower values (Fig.

A typical chromatogram of the gases is shown in Fig.
The quantitative evaluation of the chromatogram is given in Table 4.
In the future, the use of wood pyrolysis for the production of vinegar and methanol may encourage the application of this technique for extracting such a valuable product from date stones, which gives a relatively higher yield of methanol (Table 4).
