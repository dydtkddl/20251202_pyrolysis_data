EXPERIMENTAL Apparatus Figure 1 presents a schematic of the two-stage reactor used in this study, lkg of coal is pyrolysed in a cylindrical heat-resistant steel reactor (diameter 120 ram, height 260mm) heated by a tubular furnace at a rate of 3Kmin-1 from room temperature to 900 (this rate is the same as that used by Serio et alY and permits simulation of the temperature evolution in an industrial coke oven).
Coal charge The characteristics of the McClure coal, selected for this study as having good coking properties and generating no peak pressure during pyrolysis, are shown in Table 1.

The presence of four thermocouples introduced radially between the wall and the centre of the reactor, as shown in Figure 2, permits the measurement at any time during the pyrolysis run of four values characteristic of the isotherms passing through the thermocouples.

The dependence of these three rates on moisture content being similar, only results for the whole deposition are presented in Figure 4.

For contents < 8 wt% (Figure 6), deposits consist of two successive carbonaceous layers with distinct textures.
When the moisture content becomes > 8wt% (Figure 7), only the layer characteristic of a laminar pyrolytic carbon is observed, its thickness being much greater than that obtained for moisture contents < 8 wt%.

Figure 9 presents the pattern of the primary tar flow during a pyrolysis run for the various wet coal charges.
