As an example, Table 2 summarizes the reproducibility data for pyrograms of PSt with nitrogen and helium as the carrier gases, of which the thermal conductivities are 7.3 - 10-z and 40.8 - 10-2 cal/cm - s - deg (at 100 C), respectively.
Here, the reproducibility was evaluated for the relative yields of the three main products of PSt (monomer, dimer and TABLE 2 Effect of carrier gas on reproducibility of pyrolysis data for polystyrene Carrier gas Monomer Dimer Trimer rel.% a C.V.(%) * rel.% a C.V.(%) * rel.% a C.V.(%) Nitrogen 83.6 1.00 1.2 6.6 0.36 5.4 9.8 0.64 6.5 Helium 85.1 0.32 0.38 5.3 0.12 2.3 9.6 0.28 2.9 * Calculated from the data for ten replicates.

Table 3 shows the reproducibility data for a protein enzyme, lysozyme.
The experimental conditions are basically the same as those for Fig.
One typical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of an inert fusedsilica capillary columns is shown in Fig.

When the column was protected with Diasolid-H, 80-100 mesh, coated with 5% of OV-101, a well resolved chromatogram (A) including polar components can be measured for a long time (more than a few months), while in 193 (A) BY PROTECTED COLUMN CH3SCH3 ,CH3CH2SH CH3SCH=CH2 (B) BY UNPROTECTED COLUMN 0 4 14 20 40 TIME (min) 0 30 90 150 TEMP ( 0 Fig.
