The reproduci- bility of the method adopted for assessment of hy- dride distribution was checked by making two entire- ly independent counts along the stringer zone in one specimen and a maximum variation in individual points of5% was found (fig.
Despite the many variables investigated and the high applied stresses examined, no appreciable re- orientation of the hydride was observed in any of the Series A specimens (fig.
Examination of inverse pole figures (fig.
This somewhat negative result initiated work on the tube material, which was found to have a high concentration of basal poles lying in the cir- cumferential direction (fig.

Reorientation is such that the distinct zones present before treatment (fig.

Such an inter- pretation provides a reasonable basis for a preliminary assessment of the variables concerned and was there- fore applied to the results of the series B test (figs.
However it is difficult to see how some radial hydride occurs in the mixed zone without any ap- plied stress if the residual stress is below the threshold stress (fig.

The agreement obtained is extremely good, but there is some ten- dency for results to diverge at the higher holding temperatures in a way that suggests that the effec- tive solubility, under the conditions of precipitation 80 0 100 200 300 HYDROGEN CONTENT ppm Fig.
the fraction of radial hydride is given by dividing the solubility at 400 (100 ppm) by the hydrogen content for each specimen (fig.
In the current work, an ex- ponential relationship of the form was employed to fit the best curve to the experimental points for each Series C specimen and the appropriate values of R^ and B are tabulated in tables 1 and 2.
The scatter of points about the best curve was variable (fig.

The mean values of B for the mixed and stringer zone measurements (tables 1 and 2) do agree quite closely: 0.05 and 0.04 mir^/N, respec- tively.
Such agreement is very reasonable and the general variation in RQ values in tables 1 and 2 merely reflects the variability of the residual stresses imparted by the flattening procedure.
No dependence of B upon the temperature from which specimens were cooled or hydrogen content is apparent from tables 1 and 2, and in any case the hydrogen solubility curve clearly shows that the bulk of precipitation in the materials used must occur in the range 400 to 200, and nu- D.

Certainly, in the fine-grained Zr.5% Nb used in the present work, no such change in location was evident and the hydride nucleation appeared to be quite random (fig.
