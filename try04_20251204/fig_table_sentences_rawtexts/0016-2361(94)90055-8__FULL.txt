They involved pyrolysis either in inert atmosphere or vacuum (Table 1) or in furnaces or flames under fuel-rich conditions (Table 2).

Results from pyrolysis experiments in different equipment with heating rates in the range from 0.2 to 105 K s~1 {Table 7) indicate that heating rate may have an important effect on nitrogen devolatilization.
Figure 2 shows the N/C ratio in the char, normalized to the N/C ratio in the parent coal, versus devolatilization temperature.
A wide variety of experimental techniques have been used {Tables 1 and 2), and this may be why the data in the literature do not provide conclusive evidence about the influence of coal type on the formation of NH3 and HCN during pyrolysis.
Figure 3 shows that Nelson et al." found HCN to be the dominant gaseous nitrogen compound at temperatures > 1000 K, independent of coal type for the seven coals tested (brown coal to bituminous coal), whereas Baumann and Mler2 found NH3 to be dominant in the range 900-1250 K.

This applies to pyridine34'40-42, pyrrole40-41, quinoline and benzonitrile40 and coal tar44, but no amine model compound has been tested (Figure 4).
The most important reactions were found to be (1) Figure 4 Yields of HCN (open symbols) and NI-^ (solid symbols) from pyrolysis of model N compounds (pyridine, pyrrole, benzonitrile, benzoquinone), versus pyrolysis temperature: 0.
These results indicate that NH3 is a pyrolysis product at the low temperatures prevailing in FBC, and this may explain the observation of NH3 m fluidized-bed pyrolysis experiments at low temperatures as shown in Figure 3.
The results suggest that NH3 is an important volatile nitrogen compound in FBC, in apparent contrast to some of the results from coal pyrolysis experiments with fluidized beds (Figure 3) showing that HCN is a more important volatile nitrogen compound than NH3 at > 1100 K, independent of coal type23.

In Figure 5 it can be seen that the addition of 1750 ppmv of CO reduces the temperature of N^O formation; a maximum formation of 28% at ~ 1150 K corresponds with the formation of N^O in the FBC environment at this temperature.
Oxidation ofNHs in a flow reactor at a short residence time ( ~ 60 ms) produces NO at > 950 K, but N^O is not formed in detectable amounts at < 1250 K58 (Figure 5).

It is seen in Figure 5 that only ~25% of the nitrogen is converted to N^O; part of the remainder is converted to N^: NCO+N--N2+00 (18) Nitrous oxide.
Table 3 surveys reported fractional conversions of char-nitrogen to NO and N^O during combustion.
The conversions in Table 3 vary between 20 and 80% for NO and between 1.5 and 16% for N^O.
The highest conversions in Table 3 were measured in differential reactors without secondary reaction on other char particles78"81, and the same is true for the highest conversion to NO of the nitrogen in a bituminous coal char shown in Figure 7a81.

Char samples from a CFBC had a low specific surface area and lower activity than chars prepared by inert pyrolysis, when compared on a mass basis35, as was also found for the NO + char reaction (Table 4).

The numbers in Figure 11 change if other concentrations of CO and H 2 are chosen, but the general picture is the same.
The kinetic tests showed that the bed material from the brown coal bed was a very active catalyst35'90 for oxidation of NH3 and reduction of NO with CO, and the model calculations indicated that the low emission of NO when burning brown coal was due to the reduction of NO with CO over bed material at the high CO concentrations of 1-5 vol.% in the combustor (Table 7).
Discussion of NO and N^0 chemistry The kinetic model in Figure 1 and the reaction rate constants and selectivities given in Figures 2-10 and Tables 4-6 can be used in a discussion of observations on full-scale combustors and to provide an improved understanding of the phenomena in FBC.
This may have a major effect on the catalytic activity of reacted limestone, because the sulfated form under oxidizing conditions, CaS04, is a poor catalyst, whereas the sulfided form under reducing conditions, CaS, is a very active catalyst [Table 6), and N^0 may be formed by reaction between NO and reduced sulfur compounds135.
In the laboratory, 1-16% char-nitrogen conversion to N^O was observed in char combustion experiments69"77 {Table 3).
