Analysis of the multiplicity of steady states has been carried out for three circulating systems, namely, reactor heat-exchanger, reactorAautoth erm al-heatexchanger and two coupled fitsidized-bed reactors with opposed thermal effects (Fig.

Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram and basic values of the parameters for the circulating system analyzed.

(18) We have, thus, obtained a complete model of the circulating system of Fig.
The values of operational, design and the more important physicochemical parameters used in the (17) computations are collected in Table 1.
The results of the computations are presented graphically in Figs 3A6.
The position of the hysteresis loops in Figs 3A5 indicates that the influence of the feed temperature depends quantitatively on the values of 17r and q., but is always qualitatively the same.
The effects of varying parameter q, can be seen from the changes in the positions of the hysteresis loops in Figs 3 and 4.

However, at a high degree of deformation the MSS are displaced to higher fluidization ratios (Fig.
A similar effect is caused by an increase of the temperature T0 of the added stream F,,,, as is shown in Fig.
ln spite of the different type of circulating systems presented in Figs 2 and 7, the general form of both algorithms discussed above is, in principle, identical.
According to the assumption made above about the order of the reactors, the regenerator should be treated as the first reactor, the cracker as the second one (Fig.

For the data given in Table 2 these unstable states can be realized when the catalyst ratio lies between 3.1 and 3,9.
