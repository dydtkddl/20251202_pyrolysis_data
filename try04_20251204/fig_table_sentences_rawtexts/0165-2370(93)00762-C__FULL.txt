In a first approximation, the gas residence time in the reactor is then calculated from an average value of the gas flow rate in the reactor (Table 1) for each experiment: J.

Flow regime in the reactor For the extreme values of main flow rate and temperature investigated, the corresponding Reynolds numbers vary between 3 and 217 (Table 2).
Table 2 shows that this is always the case in our conditions where P roughly ranges from 300 to 1900.
Pyrolysis 28 (1994) 107-120 TABLE 2 Values of Reynolds, Peclet and Damkohler II numbers for each experiment No.
The new Peclet number (Pe) is based on the reactor diameter: Pe = umd/2D (10) With anticipated values of k,, the Damk6hler numbers, are always lower than 0.27 (Table 2).
According to Lede and Villermaux [ 19] the plug flow assumption is then correct if a second condition is simultaneously verified (negligeable axial diffusion): Pee 4a (11) Table 2 shows that this condition is always verified.
Table 1 shows that yields of up to 85% may be observed.
Table 3 reports the values of the two first-order kinetic constants (k1 and k2) calculated for four of these temperatures (698, 723, 748 and 773 K) by a two-parameter optimization software program (FLEXIPLEX).
Figure 2 shows the variation of ln(k) vs.
The corresponding frequency factors and activation energies are then calculated from the Arrhenius plot (Table 4).

The same Figure exhibits good agreement between computed and experimental values of Y, even for residence times higher than 20 s.
A comparison between the results from the present work and values of the kinetic constant of triphenylisocyanurate is shown in Fig.
Figure 2 also shows good agreement with the result of Perry and Siebers [ 15] (k2 = 8.6 s-1) obtained at a higher temperature (858 K), under reduced pressure (67 700 Pa) and with a residence time of 0.30 s in a stainless steel continuous flow reactor.
