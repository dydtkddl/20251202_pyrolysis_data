Transition Probabilities The transition probabilities summarized in Table 1 have been derived elsewhere (McDermott, 1986).
The transition probabilities for the series reactions A + B + C are complicated by the nature of a Markov chain, which formally allows TABLE 1 Transition Probabilities for Prototype Reactions Case Reaction T ransition Probability Add Itional Information 1.
Application of condi- tional probability theory allowed accounting for the occurrence of the reaction of A to B and then B to C during a given at in terms of the transition probabilities of Table 1.
Development of an arbitrary linear polymer with a degree of polymerization of 11 (10 bonds) allows demonstration, The Markov chain illustrated in Fig.
