The reactor was equipped with an external loader (see Fig.
Furthermore, due to the size of our reactor it was not possible to realize feed ratios larger than 0.07 (g tire g-' tetralin, see Table 1).
Gas phase The results from analyses of the gas phase present in the collection bag at the end of each run are reported in Figs.
The gas phase was principally constituted of nitrogen (used to pressurize the reactor), the products of tire hydrogenative pyrolysis (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and dioxide), and hydrogen from tetralin dehydrogena- 18 16 14 12 t 10 8 6 4 2 0 100 90 80 70 p t 6050 4030 20 10 (a) il- I un4 D tun 5 un6 L3 run 7 m8 C1 C2S C2U C3S C3U C4S C4U CSS CSU CC6IJ >C6 run 4 run 5 run 6 run 7 run 8 T=260 T=345 T=380 T=393 T=430 Fig.

Run 4 (T= 260) is not considered in Table 2 inasmuch as very low concentration levels were obtained in the gas phase, due to the low reaction rate.

In order to highlight the influence of temperature on the composition of the hydrocarbon fraction, the concentration of each group in the collection bag at the end of the run, expressed as molar percent (based on total hydrocarbons), is reported in Fig.
Inspection of this figure shows that the temperature influences both the degree of saturation of C-C bonds and the mean molecular weight.
In fact, as the reaction temperature rises: the concentration of the unsaturated compounds markedly decreases (see C4U and CSU) while the concentration of saturated compounds increases (see CZs and C3s); and the concentration of the heaviest gaseous hydrocarbons markedly decreases (see C4, C5, C6, and > C6) while the concentration of the lightest increases (see Ct, C2, and COI Fig.

Considering the runs carried out at reaction temperatures larger than 260, it is interesting to note (see Table 5) that the VHMWC are present in larger concentrations at 92 F.

In fact inspection of Table 5 (with reference to runs at T= 380 and T= 430) shows that the samples at is = 1 min have a content of about 3%o of these compounds which vaporize between 320 and 510.
This can be explained considering that all Table 5 Mass remaining on the TG balance at selected temperatures.

Inspection of this table shows that the hydrogen donated increases markedly with temperature.
The results are reported in Table 7 and represent the tire pyrolysis product distribution expressed as weight percent of the tire loaded.
The tire conversion to HMWC reported in Table 7 deserves discussion.

In order to make the mass balance internally consistent, the total in Table 7 has been calculated using, for the tire conversion to HMWC and VHMWC, the results obtained by a single analytical procedure; i.e., TG determination.
Inspection of Table 7 shows that for runs 5, 6, and 8 the mass balance approaches 90%.
