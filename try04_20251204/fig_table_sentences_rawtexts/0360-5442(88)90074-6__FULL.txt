Figure 3 shows a typical time history of temperatures during a run.
A computer print-out from a typical run showing the recorded data is presented in Fig.

Figure 5 gives the variation of oil yield and decomposed fraction (the weight loss of the solid) of the raw shale with temperature.
Figure 6 shows the percentage of non-condensable, at ambient temperature, products and their variation with temperature.
The distribution of tar in the stainless steel outlet tube and of oil in each of the three cold traps and its variation with temperature is shown in Fig.
As can be seen in Fig.

Figure 5 reveals that as the temperature increases, so does the vaporized fraction of the shale.
The data of Fig.
Figure 7 shows how the temperature affected the distribution of the oil among the three cold traps and the outlet tube.

Fluidized-bed results The operating conditions for the three fluidized-bed experiments we report in this paper are shown in Table 1.
The minimum fluidization velocities at operating conditions referred to in Table 1, t/, were calculated from Leva's correlation.25 The variation of oil yield and the percentage of the raw shale pyrolized with temperature is shown in Fig.
This figure shows that the amount of oil extracted from the shale is considerably higher than that of the reference Fischer Assay result.
