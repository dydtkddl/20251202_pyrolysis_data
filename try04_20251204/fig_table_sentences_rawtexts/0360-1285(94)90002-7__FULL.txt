The drops evaporate and vapors burn in the gas phase establishing a diffusion flame with the burn rate controlled by the rate of diffusion of O2 into the flame (Fig.
The coal particles pyrolyze, release about 40% mass as volatile matter (VM) which burns in the gas phase in a similar way to drop combustion (Fig.
It is inferred from experiments that the volatile flame is established away from the surface for large particles, while for smaller particles the VM burns in situ along with fixed carbon.2 The remaining skel- etal char, called a fixed carbon (FC) reacts with 02 (Fig.

For an isolated particle, a spherical envelope flame is formed around the particle (Fig.
At some point the flames surround- ing each particle will merge and a common flame is formed around the particles (Fig.
If more parti- cles are brought near, then a common flame may be formed around an array or cloud of particles (Figs 5c and 5d).
If I is the interparticle spacing, then interac- tive combustion occurs if l < 2rf (1) where rf is the flame radius of an isolated particle (Tables 1 and 2).

and the criteria in various forms can be written as shown in Table 3.
Typically Yo2.~o/hl is small, and hence rda (see Table 2) is inversely proportional to (YoJvu).
For fuel sprays, the core is fuel rich and usually the criteria in Table 3 are satisfied.

Then with (rda) replaced by 10 in Table 3 one can obtain the corresponding criteria for interactive combustion processes for the single film model (frozen gas phase).

Prior to presenting a summary of the results for the pyrolysis, ignition and combustion of clouds, the time scales involved in group combustion of a spheri- cal cloud are presented in Table 5 so that the condi- tions for steady state vs non-steady state and group analysis vs isolated particle analysis can be established.
Further, QS relations can be assumed for the particles in the cloud, since the particle density is TABLE 5.

Furthermore, the behavior of flames of 10-20pm coal versus unsieved coal; of low versus high ash coal; with cooled versus hot burner grids; sampled with hot quartz versus water cooled copper probes were essentially indistinguish- able." This result suggests the strong coupling be- tween the burner and the flame controlling the com- bustion process; however, in their results for the location of 50% oxygen consumption (Fig.
It should be noted that the authors claim that their experimental setup has a spatial resolution on the order of 1 mm, thus the exact location of the points in Fig.

From this figure it is seen that as the ambient tem- perature decreases, ignition time increases since the thermal wave penetration time is greatly increased.

On the other hand, a particle at the cloud periphery may combust in a time scale on the order of 200 ms at Yo2,= 0.23 (Table 5).
If the oxidation rate of CO is rapid, then the 02 concentration inside the cloud approaches zero; under this case the only significant reaction at the particle surface is the Boudouard reaction (reaction III) and a flame stands outside the cloud as shown in Fig.
It should be noted that the thermal penetration time given in Table 5 does not account for the heat source due to the exothermic chemical reactions I and II and the heat sink due to the endothermic reduction reaction III.

The particles then begin to burn and release a signifi- cant amount of heat which raises the gas temperature inside the cloud and for a DS, the particles reach the diffusion limit rapidly (Figs 143 and 144).
The increased particle temperature and the number of particles for the DS are respons- ible for the higher cloud burning rates as indicated in Fig.
Figure 144 presents the results as a ratio of (M/Msc).
According to the QS group combustion model, r/= 0.9 at G = 0.3 and M/Msc = 0.9 at G = 100 (Figs 126 and 130) while the transient results lead to a maximum of 1.75 for the same initial G number.
Figure 144 shows that the burning rate of the DL is about 500 times lower compared to the 586 K.

Figure 145 shows the varia- tion of dv wih cloud radius, indicating that cloud radius (where dp = 0) shrinks rapidly for dilute clouds.
Figure 146 plots d2 vs time at various loca- tions within the cloud in order to determine whether the QS ISOC model is followed.
As time progresses, the particle size decreases and the cloud shrinks, due to complete combustion of the particles near the peri- phery (Fig.
148), which causes a decrease in the burning rate of the cloud as shown in Fig.
From Fig.
148 it can be seen that the cloud with Go = 10 burns faster than the clouds with Go = 100 and Go = 1 (G in Fig.

Two flames (temperature peaks) are now formed: (i) a pseudo-premixed inner flame which propagates into the cloud consuming oxygen and providing enthalpy to the particles for pyrolysis (Fig.
Figure 149 shows the flame radii as a function of time.
Figure 150 shows the cloud mass loss rate as a function of time for particle diameters of 20, 60 and 100/Lm.
Figure 25 shows the development of interaction be- tween particles in a stream.
Initially, the particles are unaware of the presence of the other particles (Fig.

From the reported flow rates of char, carrier gas flows, particle size, etc., the l/a ratio was determined under cold flow conditions using the following relations (see Table 5 also) a = (6tv/pv)/(fn~/pg) = n(4/3)na3 (297) n ~ l/13 (298) l/a ~ (4n/(3a))1/3 (299) A knowledge of the cloud radius or number of particles in the cloud is essential to use Fig.
If coal feed rates are the same, smaller particles will have a larger particle number density than larger particles for streams of similar radii and hence the interactions will be severe, as seen in Fig.
It should be noted that Fig.
Thus, if Fig.

Burning rates (rh~xt) were determined using the energy balance equation and the temperature meas- urements rather than by CO2 measurements as used by Mulcahy and Smith.151s3 The vh~xt were then correlated by plotting rh~xt vs 1/Tp (Figs 157 and 158).

An interesting observation is that given a sample mass of m, the combustion rate per unit area of the 70 am particle is four times higher than the combustion rate of the smaller sized parti- cles, probably due to the high temperature achieved by the larger particle or to Zone II-T reaction (see Fig.
Isolated particle and dilute stream experiments on char particles reveal that particle temperature peaks during combustion, as observed from Fig.
Figure 161 shows the results.
Qualitatively Figs 160 and 161 are similar.
Also it is seen from Fig.

The larger particles burned rapidly, and large parti- cles have a higher combustion rate per unit area compared to smaller particles (Fig.

This seems to indicate either the isolated particle assumption may be valid or the heating rate and reaction rates are so slow that uniform tempera- ture and concentration exist throughout the cloud (see Figs 128 and 129).
The specific combustion rate (kg/s/kg) was found to de- crease with increasing sample mass at a given final temperature (see Fig.
It is seen from Fig.
This is very obvious from Fig.
Figure 166 shows the specific reactivity (maximum) at 500 and 1000 with the rank of char.
If each particle burns as though it is isolated and under diffusion control (large size), then the burn-off should have the following relation u = 1 - (l -- o~t/ag)3/2 (307) and for the initial periods u = (3/2)~t/a2o (308) Interactive processes in gasification and combustion 599 E 3 ~ 2 I 8 8 | 8 J | I I 70 80 C (daf) of parent coal (%) 8In e 90 FIG.

On the other hand, as the inter- particle spacing is decreased to a very low value, the cloud behaves like a sheath cloud and the mass/heat transfer rate is controlled by the transport between Interactive processes in gasification and combustion 601 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 --100 __--7_ loI io2 Io3 ,o~ lo5 N FIG.

The time scale for pyrolysis (Pyrol), N evolution (N-Evol), volatile oxidation (V-Oxid), NO formation (NO-Form) and NO destruction (NO-Destr) are given in Fig.
Hence the N has a long time to react with the oxygen in the cloud (Fig, 174).

This can be explained if one looks at N evolution in Fig.
