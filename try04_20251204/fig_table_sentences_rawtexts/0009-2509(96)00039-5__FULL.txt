The gas has a conical form because ot jet expansion angle (see Figure 2).

RESULTS Figure 3 shows the experimental (Petrobnis industrial unit) and predicted exit temperature in the fluidized bed regenerator.
It was utilized 5 different operating conditions, that can be seen in Table 2.

This effect can be observed through Figure 4, which represents the tem- perature profile against the reactor height for various jet expansion angles.
Table 3 shows the results obtained when the four cases are used in the grid zone simulations.

An average concentration, taking into account the volumet- ric fraction in these two phases, is used, and in Figure 5, the predicted profile of molar fraction of the gases is plotted with respect to the reactor height when the fourth case is considered.
The mass conversion of the solid reactants carbon and hydrogen along the bed is shown in Figure 6.
The predicted temperature profile is also shown in Figure 5.
Figure 7 reveals that the homogeneous and heterogeneous CO oxidation play an important role in the total heat generated by, chemical reaction.
