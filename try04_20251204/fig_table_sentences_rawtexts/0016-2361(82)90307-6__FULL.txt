RESULTS Studies using the electrically-heated grid The analyses of the coals are given in Table I.
Experimental results of the effects of rapid heating on the coals listed in Table 1 have been obtained by the electrically-heated grid apparatus for heating rates up to 3000 K s -1 and peak temperatures of 1400 K.

The total mass loss for similar heating times, peak temperatures and particle sizes, increases with the volatile matter (dry, ash-free basis) of the original coal, as shown in Figure 4 for a heating time of l s.
3 and 4 on the electrically-heated grid show that the composition of the tars is similar to the composition of the parent coal, their empirical formulae Figure 3 Plot of percentage mass loss and percentage tar formation against peak temperature for coal No.

3 coal in Figure 6, was significantly higher than that obtained from the electric grid experiments with a heating time of 0.5 s reaching 16% initial mass of dry, ash-free coal, at 1200 K.
The behaviour of the coals studied in the present study supports this view because, with flash pyrolysis, all seven coals studied produced mass losses in excess of the proximate volatile matter contents as shown in the lower curve in Figure 4.
Table 3 contains data which shows that, for 44 /mi particles of coal No.
3 heated to peak temperatures of 1200 K on the electrically-heated grid, the ratio V'/VM, where V represents the experimental volatile matter yield and V M represents the proximate volatile matter content, does not vary for different heating times, whereas for 126 u.m particles the ratio V'/VM is identical for heating Table 3 Comparison of ratio of experimental volatile matter yield, V',to proximate volatile matter content, VM, for various coals and experimental conditions Coal Particle size (jurn) Heating time and peak temperature of grid Heati rate (Ks- ing 1) V VM 1 126 1 s to 1200 K 900 4.2 126 44 0.5s to 1200K 1800 1.3 1.2 3 12644 1 s to 1200 K 900 1.3 1.2 126 44 2 s to 1 200 K 450 1.1 1.2 7 126 1 s to 1200 K 900 1.5 Fluidized-bed operating temperature 44 900 K 1200 K 1.3 1.1 FU EL, 1982, Vol 61, September 811 Flash pyrolysis of coals: J.
3, pyrolysed in the fluidized bed, produced greater yields of volatile matter at 900 K than at 1200 K due to a decrease in the rate of tar production at temperatures > 900 K, as shown in the lower portion of Table 3.
The yield of total volatile matter of 126 um particles, heated for l s using the heated-grid technique, can be estimated using the following relations valid to within % experimental error, for the seven coals studied: F =0.99 FM+0.07 650K<T<850K (l) V =0.91(^+0.19 850K<T<1250K (2) where: V, yield of total volatile matter as a fraction of initial coal mass; VM, proximate analysis volatile matter content as a fraction of the initial mass of dry, ash-free coal, not as a percentage, as presented in Table 1; and T, maximum temperature attained by the grid during the heating period.
This is demonstrated in Figure 1 which shows that the total mass loss at peak temperatures < w 600 K is similar for all the coals except coal No.
A decrease in the heating time increased the production of methane as shown in Figure 7, which shows that more methane was produced at heating times of 0.5 and l s than at a heating time of 2 s.
The variation of H/C and 0/C ratios with temperature, in the gases, (Figure 8) indicates that oxygen was a more reactive participant, especially above 800 K.
At high temperatures, reactions producing low- molecular-mass gaseous hydrocarbons are more likely, with more unsaturated molecules appearing with increasing energy input.19 The ratio of methane to ethylene, as shown in Figure 9, varies slightly with technique and does not change substantially with temperature but the ratio of ethylene to ethane, in Figure 10, increases with increasing temperature up to w 1000 K for the fluidized-bed technique, but, for the electrically- heated grid, decreases between 600 and 800 K and, at a higher temperature, remains constant, suggesting the possibility of cracking of volatile products in the fluidized bed.

3 coal presented here are within the range but are on the low side compared with some published values.8'10-20 This may be due to the fact that, in this work, the values of A, E, and x were freely determined as a set, whereas in some published work, A or 40 - 30 20 10 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Peak temperature ( K ) Figure 11 Comparison of computed curves with experimental data for percentage mass loss against peak temperature for No.

4, for the overall single- reaction model and for the first reaction of the two- reaction models, shown in Table 4 with their associated pre-exponential factors, represent rates of reaction which are comparable with rates from other published single- reaction models.8'29 Thus, despite differing apparent activation energies, when comparing similar coals and techniques, consistent rates of reaction are obtainable because the calculated pre-exponential factors alter also.
