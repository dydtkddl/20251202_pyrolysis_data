With an increase in temperature the coke becomes more dense owing to the removal Fig.
noniogenic surface active agents can be effectively adsorbed (Table 1).
In such hydrophobized pores large molecules of anionic dyes are effectively adsorbed (see Fig.

Table 2 lists the adsorption characteristics of car- bon-mineral adsorbents prepared on the basis of car- burized clays, as well as the data obtained for starting and thermally modified sorbents [28-30].
To illustrate this fact we will analyze the data presented in Table 1 and Fig.
The last material is characterized by larger mesopores (Table 2).
In this connection the car- bon-mineral adsorbent prepared on the basis of such material is characterized by an increased sorption ca- 127 TABLE 2.
It is, however, a poorer material in comparison to the latter in respect of adsorption capacity for small n-nitroaniline molecules from aqueous solutions (Fig.

The montmorillonite is characterized by high thermostability because heating of this mineral at 500 practically does not change its sorption capacity (Fig.
Also the carburized montmorillonite containing Fig.

In Table 1 there are listed numerical values of maximal adsorption a, of n-nitroaniline and surfactant OP-7 on several carbon-mineral adsorbents and on active KAD charcoal.
From the data listed in this Table it can be seen that after the formation of carbon deposit on the mineral surface the adsorbent becomes capable of the sorption of n-nitroaniline.
From the data discussed here it also results that the noniogenic surface active agent OP-7 adsorbs better on the consumed OA-4 clay than on the other adsorbents listed in Table 1.
On the surface of crystalline forms of silica this deposit distributes non- uniformly (Fig.
a major part of this deposit localizes in intercrystalline spaces, these being the amor- phous parts of the silica bed (Fig.
In this respect better results are obtained by hydrothermal treatment of the carbosils [70, 71], especially in the case when the (a) Fig.

The data listed in this Table are very interesting because they show the effect of such a treatment on the properties of carbosils obtained by pyrolysis of the substances of different chemical nature and containing different amounts of carbon on the support (silica) surface.

4 and 5 (Table 3).
In the case of the carbosils containing a relatively small amount of carbon (adsorbents 6, 8 and 10 listed in Table 3) the active surface of silica (not covered with carbon deposit) is significantly greater than for adsorbents 1 and 3 (Table 3).
This leads among others to a dramatic change of specific surface area and to a strong increase of adsorption heats (adsorbents 7, 9, 11, Table 3).
This is illustrated by the data listed in Table 4 in which the effects of modification of two adsorbents (X and Y) 138 TABLE 4.
Modification of the surface of X and Y adsorbents with the products of pyrolysis of these alcohols causes significant changes in the geometrical structure of these pores (R^om, Fig- 8, Table 4) as well as in the chemical structure of adsorption centres (adsorption heats, Table 4).

The silanization of carbosils leads to a significant decrease of adsorption heats of hydrocarbons, to improvement of resolution of the 139 TABLE 5.
