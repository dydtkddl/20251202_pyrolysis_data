In Canada, only Syncrude Canada Ltd and Imperial Oil Ltd use the fluid coking process (Figs 1 and 2).

Foster Wheeler boilers Foster Wheeler boilers that are operating or have operated on petroleum coke are listed in Table 1.15 The most important Foster Wheeler petroleum coke project and certainly their largest is the NISCO cogeneration project.
This project has been described in detail in three recent reports 12.16,1 ' and boiler conditions are given in Table 1.
Table 2 gives the composition (ultimate analysis) for the fuel.
The boilers operated are fired either entirely with petroleum coke (5 units) or cofired with petroleum coke and coal (2 units) or gas (1 unit) and are listed in Table 3.'t~'s-_z' The design of these units, which are low-profile and modular in construction, permits shop fabrication, facilitates construction and scale-up.
This unit has been fired with either 100 petroleum coke or 100 high sulphur coal and is used for cogeneration (see Table 4 for steam conditions).

ABB believes that CFB technology is particularly suited to petroleum coke combustion, since it can provide efficient combustion with low emissions, inbed sulphur removal and has a tolerance to heavy metals." ABB has carried out experimental work using the University of British Columbia (UBC) pilot-scale combustor, the 22 MWe Chatham CFBC and the 65 MWe Scott Paper unit (Table 6).

However, one might speculate that higher temperatures are associated with a lower bed carbon loading and hence their contribu- Fluidized bed combustion Table 7.
Table 7 shows that CANMET supported work on a pilot CFBC which also gave very similar results.
Table 7 gives the degree of conversion of fuel nitrogen to NO, and NZO for these trials.

His summary of those differences of opinion obtained from a literature survey are present in Table 8.
Thus in CANMET supported work, as discussed above, limestone was shown to produce a net reduction in NZO in the 30% range (Table 7) while varying the Ca/S molar ratio over a normal range did not alter the degree of reduction, i.e.
Thus, for example, the Western Research Institute (WRI) indicated that the petroleum coke ash samples from California (origin unspecified) did not appear promising for construction application and showed poor strength development .'3 Similar conclusions were drawn by Dearborn who carried out a study for Environment Canada on the ashes from the Chatham CFBC unit when burning a delayed coke." The residues produced by CFBC combustion of petroleum coke were also found to contain significant unreacted lime; in some cases higher quantities than were found in coal derived residues from the Chatham CFBC boiler burning 5-7% sulphur containing coals." An approximate composition for the ashes from the Chatham unit for combustion trials is given in Table 9 together with data for combustion trials on Fluidized bed combustion Table 9.
However, the tailings properties were strongly dependent on moisture content (Table 10).

In North America, the figure of one tyre a year per person is often quoted as the typical generation rate of tyres, showing that tyre disposal is indeed a major environmental problem.
