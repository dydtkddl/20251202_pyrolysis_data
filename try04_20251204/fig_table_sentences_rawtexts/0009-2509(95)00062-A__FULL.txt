Figure 1 illustrates a half-section through a cylin- drical tire particle in a hot environment.
As shown in Fig.
In the reacted zone, as most of the volatiles have left, the porous solid structure allows an easy flow of the volatile vapors from the reaction zone towards the Carbon Black Reaction Zone ~--~ Virgin Tire ~~ ~(~= Qr I ~ Reaction Heat Transfer Mass Transfer Fig.
Table 1 gives characteristic times for the physical and chem- ical processes during the pyrolysis of a tire particle, including heat conduction, pyrolysis reactions, vol- atiles transportation in the reaction zone (including diffusion and bubble transportation phenomena) and viscous flow in the reacted zone (flow of volatile vapors across the porous carbon black towards the surface of the particle).
The thermal and kinetic para- meters used in the study are presented in Table 2.

Table 1 also shows that the intra- particle heat transfer is faster than the transportation of pyrolysis products.
Figure 2 illus- trates the weight loss and enthalpy change behavior of a truck tire sample as measured by a combined TG/DTA thermal analysis instrument (Seiko SSC/5200) for a 4 mg sample mass.
Three steps can be identi- fied in Fig.

The tire particle was pyrolyzed under vacuum con- ditions in a molten lead batch reactor, depicted in Fig.
Its composition and also the thermal and kin- etic pyrolysis behaviors were analyzed by TG/DTA, Table 3.
as shown in Table 3 and Fig.
Simulation of the measured temperature history The experimental measured temperature history at the centre of the particle is illustrated in Fig.
In Fig.
An exothermic peak at TMAX = 445°C is observed in Fig.
Simulation of the experimental measured temper- ature history was carried out with different values of me, and the best experimental fit was obtained when mc was set at 80% of the VM content, or 0.8VM (Fig.
The simulated temperature histories with mc = 0.0 VM (curve 2), 0.8 VM (curve 3) and 1.0 VM (curve 4) are compared in Fig.
A sharp endothermic peak occurs, which is very similar to that on the DTA curve in Fig.
