The operating conditions, reactor characteristics and catalyst properties are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1.
The dimensionless equations for the heterogeneous diffusion/convection model (model HT~~) are presented in Table 2.
Table 3 shows the definition of the coefficients ct s involved in the previous model equations which account for the influence of temperature on the values of system physical properties.

This is shown in Fig.4 a) for the HTd~ model (Am = 10) where 9, is plotted versus conversion.
Fig.4 b).By using the inflection point leading to higher temperatures (hereafter called first inflection point) we obtain the runaway diagram shown in Fig.5.
In this figure all models are compared and the effect of the intraparticle convection (or Am) is observed.
