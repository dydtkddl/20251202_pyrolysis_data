When the standard intrinsic rates were calculated, the experi- mental data for any order m yielded the following correlation for the intrinsic burn rate of particle at po2.w = 1 atm (Fig.
This can be illustrated by the graph shown in Fig.
In the first extreme, the volatiles released by the coal particle prevent oxygen from reaching the particle surface and the ratio VM/FC in the coal particle drops to zero when rnp/mp.o is equal to (1 - Q[VM]) (Fig.

In the other extreme, no pyrolysis occurs and the fixed carbon and volatile matter are con- sumed heterogeneously in proportion to the coal composition and thus VM/FC remains constant throughout combustion (Fig.
These results were transformed to (VM/VMo) vs m/mp.o assuming VM = 0.4 and are shown on Fig.

The experimental data for T/i,a vs dp.o is shown in Fig.
Qualitatively, this behavior is similar to the behavior of the model results of Bandyopadhyay and Bhaduri39 shown in Fig.
The combined effect will be less for coarse particles than for fine particles.99 If CO is assumed to be the primary product, T~oa increases by 100-300 K (210, 160 K for 60 and 200 ~rnl).99 These are comparable to the predictions given in Fig.

For homogeneous ignition (GIT), it is seen that decreasing particle size increases T~ as in the heterogeneous mode (HIT) (Fig.
However, for homogeneous ignition, increased oxygen concentration results in increased values of T~.~ (Fig.
More rigorous steady state analysis of isolated coal particle ignition has been recently carried out by Gururajan eta[.99 which considers the oxidation of volatiles without flame sheet approximation and the results show decreasing ignition temperature with increasing oxygen concentration (Fig.

(42) Then Tp > 1700, 2200, 3000 K for dp= 1000, 500, 300/an (Fig.
Thus, they plotted the combustion rate (i) using their experimentally measured values (Fig.
It is seen that for lower values of hm (higher x), Yo2.w ap- proaches zero (Fig.
41a) and combustion is diffusion- ally controlled (Fig.
For higher values of hm (lower x), Yo~ approaches Yo~.(Fig.
41a) and the burning rate as a fraction of the diffusion-con- trolled rate decreases (Fig.
The dependency of rh32 on Yo2.w can be determined from Fig.
There are three regimes, low Tp, medium Tp and high Tp, as shown in Fig.
In high Tp regime (Tp > 1800 K), reaction III dominates along with CO oxidation increasing the burn rate with Tp Somewhat similar results are observed in Fig.
(47d) (B) Diffusion controlled combustion: The oxygen transfer rate is controlled by diffusion to the particle surface (Fig.

In the DFM, the Boudouard reaction (reaction III) is assumed to be the primary heterogeneous reaction (Fig.

For QS combustion, if thermodynamic equilibrium exists between COz, CO and Oz, then the COz and Oz concentration at the particle surface is negligible while COz is a maximum in the gas phase.17 This indicates that CO is produced by the reduction reac- tion of CO2 with C while CO burns rapidly in the gas phase with a negligible concentration beyond the flame surface (see Fig.
Note that radiative effect decreases with decrease in particle diameter as shown in Fig.
Hence as the particle burns under diffusion control, dp decreases and hence Tp increases as long as particle bums under diffusion control as illustrated in Fig.

Figure 44b shows the results of the com- parison between the experiments and theory.
As the particle size decreases, the mass transfer rate increases and hence combustion becomes kinetically controlled accompanied by a de- crease in temperature as a result of increased diffusive heat loss.1 Figure 45a shows a typical plot of the variation of Tp with time and Fig.
The experimental data of Sahu and Gavalast qualita- tively confirm the model results of Fig.

Using the analogy between the combustion of liquid and of carbon under forced convection under dif- fusion control, the results for the nondimensional burn rate of carbon for both the SFM and DFM models under forced convection can be plotted as shown in Fig.
The integral solutions for the nondimensional burn rate, boundary layer thickness and maximum velocity are presented for the combustion of a vertical carbon surface assuming SFM (Fig.
49a) and DFM (Fig.
49b).tsIt is seen that the maximum velocity is higher for DFM due to a peak in gas temperature which results in reduced boundary layer thickness and increased burn rate for DFM (Fig.
The authors found that if results are generated for frozen flow with either C + (1/2)O2 --~ CO or C + 02 --* CO, being the primary heterogeneous reaction, then Matsui's133 results (which included CO oxidation in gas phase) fall between them (Fig.

However the specific internal surface area (area per unit mass) monotonically increases since the mass decreases rapidly (Fig.
The internal surface area is a function of volatile matter of coal (see Fig.
The distribution of macro, meso and micro pores during burn off is given in Fig.
52.123 The internal surface area of coal increases first with burnout due to the opening of more pores and de- creases later due to the coalescence of pores (Fig.

Assuming Yo~.w = 0.23 with the same values used before, the variation of Tm,~ - Tw with void fraction can be plotted if CO and CO2 are assumed to be the primary products (Fig.
Equation (112) and Fig.
Since the available S~ for reaction may be less than the quoted values (especially as the void fraction is increased), the effect of the reduction in So on Tm~ - T~ is shown in Fig.
However, if the void fraction is higher than 0.2 (say 0.5), then from Fig.
