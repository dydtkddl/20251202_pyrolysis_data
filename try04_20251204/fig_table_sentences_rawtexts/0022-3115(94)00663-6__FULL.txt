Table 1 illustrates the possible regions where ceramic composites could re- place metallic structure.
This table is based on prelimi- nary design reports for the international thermonu- clear experimental reactor (ITER) [5].
The ITER fu- sion core structure is broken down in this table into 5 components and listed in order of decreasingly de- manding material requirements (i.e.
Of significance in this table is that the components which are subjected to the highest heat flux and radiation dose (i.e.

Table 2 gives specifics of six candidate fibers including Nicalon for reference.
Note from the table that the average SiC crystallite size has been increased for this material while the strength has been slightly reduced and the modulus of the fiber has significantly in- creased.
Two of the SiC-based fibers listed in Table 2 were not fabricated into composites for this study for practical reasons.

Bending strength The results of the four point bend tests on all composites fabricated are given in Table 3.
From the table it is seen that the low-oxygen- content Hi-Nicalon yielded an ultimate bend strength of 348 + 27 MPa versus the 292 + 26 MPa achieved for standard Nicalon.
From Table 3 it can be seen that increasing the interracial thickness from 0.15 to 0.3 ~m increased the measured strength from 123 + 6 to 144 + 9 MPa.

Nicalon based composite material The thermal conductivities for these materials are given in Table 4 for different directions both parallel (in-plane) and perpendicular (cross ply) to the fabric layers.
Table 4 also gives data for the SiC fiber composites following a 6 h furnace oxidation (in air) at 600.
For the CVD SiC/Nicalon composite the cross ply thermal conduc- It has been previously demonstrated [6] (Fig.

In areas such as the shield and magnet, where the lifetime displacement level would not approach 1 dpa and the stress levels are more modest (Table 1), the material may be adequate, however.

A straightforward comparison of a composite fabri- cated from standard and Hi-Nicalon, processed at identical conditions, indicates that the unirradiated mechanical properties are superior for the Hi-Nicalon system (Fig.
2 and Table 3).
Of interest is that the load drop-off behavior (Fig.

The small contribution of the fibers to the composite conductivity was demonstrated by removing the graphitic interface through oxidation (Table 4).
For the case of SiC it has been shown [20] that fission neutron irradiation of pyrolitic I~-SiC caused a reduc- tion in the room temperature thermal conductivity by a Fig.
It is seen by inspection of Table 2 and Fig.
The brittle nature of the failure is seen clearly in the flexure curves (Fig.

This figure shows a scanning electron micrograph of the fracture surface for the MER fiber composite with the ~ 0.3 ~m interface.

An example of this non-uniformity can be seen in Fig.
These surface nonuniformities negate the effectiveness of the interfacial layer, causing mechanical interlocking of the fiber and matrix leading to the brittle-type failure exhibited in Fig.
