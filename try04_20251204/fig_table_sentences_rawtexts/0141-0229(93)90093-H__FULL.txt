Screened fractions were derived from peroxidetreated eucalyptus (SEE-H202), and the F-150 and F200 fractions were shown to consist of a population of fibers with an average length of 380 and 230 gm, respectively (Table 1).
Small fragments with dimensions of 50-100 gm appeared to quickly accumulate in the earlier stages of hydrolysis (Figure IA).
The average fiber length of the F-150 fraction decreased from 380 to approximately 120 ~Lm within 2 h, while only 25% of the substrate was hydrolyzed to glucose (Table 1).

Screening of this sample provided two fractions, designated as FBEP-48 and FBEP100, which consisted of a population of fibers with an average length of 920 and 700 gm, respectively (Table 2).
'I In fact, a 2% (w/v) suspension of each of these fractions was almost completely hydrolyzed within 48 h, using an enzyme loading of 10 FPU g-' (Table 2).
A short incubation time of 2 h was all that was required to reduce the average fiber length of the FBEP-48 from 920 to 170 [Lm (Table 2).

The fiber lengths were all cumulative distribution values at least two inflexion points was observed after 30 min, suggesting that long fibers were also rapidly fragmented during hydrolysis (Figure 7B).
Similar results were obtained for the FBEP-100 fraction (Table 2).
It was observed that a population of much smaller particles, averaging approximately 5-10 Am in length, was released and gradually accumulated during hydrolysis of the F-150 fraction (Figure 2).
When these particles, which were virtually absent in the original, unhydrolyzed substrate (Figure 2A and B), were examined using polarized light, it appeared that they consisted of fragments of libriform fibers which still retained a high degree of crystallinity.
The three fractions derived from the SEEH202 substrate were shown to have a similar MW distribution with a weighted average degree of polymerization (DPW) of 361 22 (DPN = 82 5) anhydroglucose units (Table 1).
GPC analysis of the cellulose tricarbanylate derived from partially hydrolyzed residues indicated that hydrolysis caused a shift in the MW distribution of cellulose toward low-MW cellooligomers (Figure 3A and B).
Enzymatic hydrolysis of both the F-150 and F-200 fractions was shown to decrease both the DPW and DPN of cellulose in a similar fashion (Table 1).
However, no great increase in polydispersity (DPW/DPN) was observed throughout hydrolysis of these fractions (Table 1 and Figure 3A).
200) persisted in the reaction mixture even after more extended incubation times (14 h) (Figure 3B).
Nevertheless, during the first 24 h of hydrolysis of both the FBEP48 and FBEP-100 substrates, there was no significant change in the MW distribution of either substrate (Table 2 and Figure 4A).
The polydispersity of the FBEP-48 fraction increased from 5.9 at 24 h to 10.1 at 48 h (Table 2).
This was partly associated with an increased accumulation of a subpopulation of molecules with a DPW of approximately 33 anhydroglucose units (Figure 4A and B).
The effect of enzymatic hydrolysis on the degree of crystallinity of the F-150 fraction was then followed by x-ray diffraction (Table 3 and Figure 5).
There was a gradual reduction in the degree of crystallinity of the substrate during the first 10 h of hydrolysis, as indicated by a substantial decrease in the intensity of the diffraction pattern of partially hydrolyzed residues (Figure 5).
This trend was also observed when the crystallinity index (CrI) of the substrate was calculated from each of the diffractograms using empirical methods (Table 3).

The intensity of the diffraction pattern obtained with the partially hydrolyzed residues was very similar to that of the original, unhydrolyzed residue (Figure 6).
These observations were confirmed by the CrI values which were calculated from each of the diffractograms using both the intensity and the area integration methods (Table 4).
Although they were indirect measurements, our results indicated that for the F-150 fraction derived from peroxide-treated eucalyptus, the average thickness of the crystallite at the 040 diffraction plane remained relatively constant, whereas the thickness at the 002 diffraction plane decreased (Table 3).
For the FBEP-48 fraction, however, the average crystallite dimensions were shown to remain relatively constant throughout hydrolysis (Table 4).

At the fiber level, these changes are mainly depicted by a partial delamination of the cell wall and a considerable degree of defibrillation.49 At the molecular level, however, steam pretreatment appears to decrease the DP of cellulose 2so,sl and gradually increase its apparent degree of crystallinity.5By contrast, in a kraft pulping process, the pretreated pulp usually consists of a population of fibers with a relatively high average fiber length m z O m 0.5 80 A 3h 24 h 01 I 16 18 8 20 22 24 26 28 30 ELUTION VOLUME (mL) m H h B 40 20 0 l I , , - i 1 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 DEGREE OF POLYMERISATION Figure 4 Effect of enzymatic hydrolysis on both the molecular weight (MW) distribution and the degree of polymerization (DP) of the FBEP-48 fraction derived from a fully bleached, eucalyptus kraft pulp.
