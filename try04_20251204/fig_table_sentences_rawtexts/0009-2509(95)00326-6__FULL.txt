A typical fit of the exit tracer concentration = profile to the prediction of the above model is shown in Fig.
Figure 4(a) shows the transition"~ = velocities Uc in the 100 mm ID bed obtained from pressure fluctuations data for the FCC particles.
Fig- ure 4(b) shows the mean values of the axial dispersion coefficient in a bed of FCC particles from eight repeat- ed experiments at each velocity.
The O,lO value of U~ observed is of the order of magnitude of the prediction from reported correlations (see Table 0,05 2).

It is clear from this figure that this model can also satisfactorily predict our data in a wide range of the number of reaction units.
