Figure 1 shows an example of such a thermogram under nitrogen flow and at slightly reduced pressure (pumping out the capillary connecting the thermoanalyzer and the mass spectrometer is needed for better transport of the gases evolving during thermal analysis, but reduces the working pressure to typically 740 mmHg).

Simultaneous mass spectra analysis of the gases evolved during the second step shows the following chemicals to be generated: CpH, Me3 SiCl, and a very small amount of HN(SiMe3)2 at the end of the decomposition (Fig.
