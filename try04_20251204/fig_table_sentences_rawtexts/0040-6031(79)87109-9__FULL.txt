The yields of the mayor gas products as functions of reactor temperature are also shown in Fig.
Compared to the product yields for naphtha pyrolysis, the following conclusions can be derived: (i) ethylene yields was relatively insensitive to furnace temperature for cyclohexane pyrolysis, whereas it was observed to increase monotonically with temperature for naphtha pyrolysis; 203 TABLE 3 Product yields for cyclohexane pyrolysis for the annular reactor (S/V = 21 5 cm-1; H, cyclohexane = 20) Product yields (art fraction of feed) 750 C 830 C 90011C Methane 0.168 0.142 0.124 Ethane 0 042 0.039 0.044 Ethylene 0.428 0.432 0.402 Propylene 0 087 0.146 0 041 Butene-1 0.012 0.016 0 015 Butadiene 0.151 0.132 0.264 Butene-2 0.01-1 - - Coke 0.097 0.098 0.105 (ii) propylene yield went through a maximum at a lower temperature for naphtha (-700 C) compared to cyclohexane (830 C); (iii) butadiene yield increased from 0.15 at 750aC to 0.26 at 900 C for cyclohexane pyrolysis, while it decreased somewhat in this temperature range for naphtha pyrolysis from about 0.10 to 0.05.
Effect of S/V and H_/naphtha ratios Ethylene Figure 5 shows the effect of hydrogen to naphtha ratio on ethylene yield in the annular reactor (S/V = 21 5 cm-1).

This temperature occurred sharply at 780 C for H2/naphtha = 7.0 and a broad maximum occurred at about 800 C for H,/ naphtha = 28, representing a temperature shift of about 20 C The effect of coke yield as a function of tube size was also investigated and is shown in Fig.
