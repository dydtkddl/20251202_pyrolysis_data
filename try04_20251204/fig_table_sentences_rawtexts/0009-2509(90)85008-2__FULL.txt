In formulating the overall radical balance, then we took all termination rate constants involving identical radicals to be equal to k 7~, and the rate constants for the cross-combination reactions were set equal to kr = ~ The foregoing approximations combine with the initiation and termination steps depicted in Fig.

Pure component pyrolyses To verify that the reaction mechanism displayed in Fig.

Figure 4 displays these comparisons for PDB pyro- lysis at 400 C.
The agreement between the calculated molar yields, depicted as solid lines, and the experi- mental molar yields (Savage and Klein, 1987), pre- sented as symbols, is very good for both toluene and n-tridecane as evidenced by inspection of Fig.

Equation (13) was used to calculate the relative reaction rates for PDB and TDC, and Fig.
Figure 6(b) shows the pronounced effect of added PDB on the relative rate of TDC pyrolysis, which increases more than nine-fold when [TDC] = 10 M and PDB is present in an equal concentra- tion.

Figure 7, which shows the selectivity of PDB to toluene and to trideeane, reveals that the selectivities to both prod- ucts are nearly insensitive to the addition of TDC except at high [TDC]/[PDB] ratios and high PDB concentrations.
Further inspection of Fig.
This dramatic change in selectivity and shift in the major products from PDB pyroysis was noted previously and modeled by Savage and Klein (l989b) using the reaction mechanism of Fig.

DISCUSSION OF MODEL RESULTS The results of the pyrolysis simulation for binary mixtures of PDB and TDC, presented in Figs 6 8 as relative reaction rates and product selectivities, ex- hibit four key trends as itemized below.
Table 5, which shows that /3 radicals are present in much higher concentrations than p radicals when [PDB] = [TDC] = 0.0001 M, verifies this scenario.
As the following discussion will show, both of these modes of acceleration are important for the pyrolysis of binary mixtures of PDB and TDC, and the latter mode is responsible for the rate acceleration depicted in Fig.
The acceleration of TDC pyrolysis by the addition of PDB, as portrayed in Fig.
The net result of this effect is, therefore, to reduce the relative reaction rate at high relative concentrations and pro- duce the maxima apparent in Fig.
Inspection of the product selectivities at the high concentrations (1.0 M) in Figs 7 and 8 confirms this hypothesis.
These figures show an increase in the selectivity of PDB to toluene [Fig.
7(a)] and of TDC to eyelohexane [Fig.
Table 6, which summarizes the results of the calculations, shows that both yu and y~ are less than unity for all values of 1.
The data in Table 2 show that this ratio is 317.
Such acceleration is indeed observed in the mixture pyroly- sis simulation results displayed in Fig.
The effect of this behavior is displayed in Fig.
IMPLICATIONS TO ASPHALTENE PYROLYSIS Asphaltenes, the heptane-insoluble fraction of heavy oils, are a complex mixture of the more polar, Table 6.
To discern these effects, attention will be focused on the high concentration (e.g., 1.0 M) data of Figs 6 8 because these liquid- phase conditions are more likely to reflect the condi- tions present during the neat pyrolysis of petroleum asphaltenes.
The data for [PDB] = 1.0 M in Fig.
The curve for [TDC] = 1.0 M in Fig.
Inspection of the 1.0 M curves of Figs 7 and 8, which show enhanced selectivities to toluene and cyclohexane at high relative concentrations, intimate slightly higher yields of methyl-substituted aromatics and unsubstituted naphthenic rings from asphaltene pyrolysis than would be indicated by the individual pyrolyses of PDB and TDC.
