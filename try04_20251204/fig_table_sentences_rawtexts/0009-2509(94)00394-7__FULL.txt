EXPERIMENTAL Powder synthesis and characteri2allon Figure 1 shows a schematic of the experimental set- up.
Rotameters were used for measuring the air, methane Flame Reactor Methane Air Argon SICI4 TiCI4 Fig.
The reactor design used for the photocatalytic eva- luation of the commercial powders and the powders made in this study is shown in Fig.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION flame synthesis of titania powders Powders were synthesized at four flame conditions as shown in Table 1 along with the corresponding measured flame temperatures and residence times.
Table 2 shows the specific surface area of the powders used in this study.
Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns of titania powders synthesized under the conditions given in Table 1.
The calculated rutile content of these powders is listed in Table 2.
Figure 4 shows TEM pictures of (a) pure (Fl) and (b) Si-doped (FS 1) powders made in flame 1.
Figure 5 shows the calculated rutile weight frac- tions of Si-doped titania made at various SiCl4/ TiCI4 molar ratios in flames 1 and 2, powders FSl and FS2, respectively.

Figure 6 shows XRD patterns of the Si-doped powders synthesized in flame 1 at various SiCI4JTiCLs molar ratios.
Figure 7 shows the BET specific surface area of powders FS 1 and FS2 plotted as a function of SiC14 concentration in the flame.
