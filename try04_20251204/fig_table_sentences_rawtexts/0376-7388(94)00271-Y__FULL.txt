Table 4 shows the result of assuming no hydrogen mass transfer between the dense and the bubble phases.
Table 4 shows a small reduction in the XES, large reductions in YST and Yaz, and a large increase in YTOL" The reasons for the reduction in the XEB, YST and YBz and the increase in the YTOL are quite obvious, because the increased amount of the H2 in the dense phase increases the backward step of the reversible reaction and also increases the hydrodealkylation reaction (i.e.
