If the spin popula- tions of the two states in the spin system are denoted by N2 and N0, and the total number of spins in the sample is N( = N2 + N0), then the populations in states cc and fi are given by a Boltzmann relationship such that N2 = N8 exp (AH/kT), which at normal temperatures gives the following expression for the ~difference in populations at equilibrium: Table 1.

In a real NMR experiment, the field B, is usually applied in the plane perpendicular to the static field B,,; for the case with B, along the n direction and for an off-resonance condition (w, w0) the effective field is given by B2.,1=(Ba_i!!1)k/Bii where k and i are the unit vectors along the z and x axes, respectively, and (B0 w,/y) is the effective longitudinal field, as shown in Fig.
Under this condi- tion, if the B, field is applied for a time t, the equilib- rium magnetisation vector M0 will be rotated by an angle yB,t in the y z plan; as shown in Fig.

Figure 8(a) shows how the energy levels of a system with I = 1 interacting with an axially sym- metric field gradient will be modified giving rise to a spectrum consisting of two resonance lines.
The variation of Av with O is shown in Fig.
For a polycrystalline material the quadrupolar nucleus will take up every value of O and hence the spectrum, or the so-called powder pattern, will be the sum of contributions for each value of O as shown in Fig.
The effect of motion has a drastic effect on the visual appearance of the powder pattern which makes deuterium NMR a powerful probe of molecular dynamics [see Fig.

In order to overcome this problem the pulsed field gradient (PFG) technique [Fig.
However, the existence of self-diffusive motion means that the spins, which have been phase encoded by the first gradient pulse, change position during the interval A (referred to as the diffusion time) and their contribution to the echo will be reduced as demon- strated in Fig.
For systems where very rapid and irrevers- ible loss of transverse coherence occurs due to a short ~ 2 and where T2 cc T1, the resulting restriction on the value of t4 can be overcome by replacing the 1800 pulse with separated 90 pulses as shown in Fig.

In general the contrast evolution and resolution steps in an NMR experiment may be separated as shown in Fig.
In order to understand the meth- ods of contrast imaging, the origin of T1 and T2 contrast effects will now be derived for the spin-echo and gradient-echo sequences shown in Figs 18 and 19, respectively.
