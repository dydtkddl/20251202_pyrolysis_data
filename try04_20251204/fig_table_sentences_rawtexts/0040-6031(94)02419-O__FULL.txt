Table 1 presents the results of thermodesorption experiments as rates of recovery.
The data given in Table 1 are mean recoveries from three runs each.

The values obtained for sediment and its ash are close to those presented in Table 1, which refer to other sorbent batches.
The data set in Table 3 was condensed to the most conclusive components.
The data in the next-to-last column of Table 3 give evidence of the reason.
Table 4 presents results of pyrolysis experiments in closed glass capillaries.
The list of compounds in Table 4 and the following >les was reduced to 16 components for reasons of clarity.
Pyrolysis runs at 300 with quartz powder as carrier produced low conversion dees (Table 4, column 4) even after 16 h of pyrolysis.

With sediment, the conversion degrees are only slightly higher n with quartz powder after 16 h of pyrolysis (Table 4, columns 4 and 5).
It becomes obvious from the curves in Fig.
These values for the PAHs studied are collected in column 3 of Table 4.
It is it from Table 4 that PAHs with a SCR value >_3 are reactive, whereas those having a er SCR are not.
