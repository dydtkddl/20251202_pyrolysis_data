Figure 5.4 shows a large quantity of data scaled in to a first Born calculation and then in comparison in fig.
(5.17a,b) Thus this treatment predicts that the cross section for ionization is less than the Born result for protons at asymptotic energies, see fig.
The total cross section is the sum of the two effects, but the result that o~(p~ )Io~(p) is less than unity at high energies is the same, fig.
It predicts a ratio greater than unity for positively to negatively charged particles at modestly high velocities, as can be seen in fig.
This brings the answers for all cross sections to be much closer to the Born result at high energies, see fig.
