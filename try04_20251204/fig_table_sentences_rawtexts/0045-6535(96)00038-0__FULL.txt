In order to have an overview of most species separated by gas capillary chromatography, Figure 1 combines the most significant parts of five different chromatograms obtained under different experimental conditions.
The interest of this figure is to show the great variety of species (at least 40) produced by the thermal degradation of 1,3-hexachlorobutadiene.

Its concentration as a function of temperature for 2 s passes through a maximum of 3500 ppmV at 850 (Fig.4) then, it decreases but the level of its concentration remains significant at 1100C : 400 ppmV.
COCI2 represents the major intermediate chlorinated product over the temperature range 600-830 (Fig.5).
Their maximum concentration ( ~ 100 ppmV) is observed at 700-750 (Fig.5).
All other chlorinated organic species quantified in this study (Fig.6) have a concentration level lower to 10 ppmV.
