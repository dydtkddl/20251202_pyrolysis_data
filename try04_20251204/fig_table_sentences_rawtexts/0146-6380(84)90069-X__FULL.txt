Oxidation The oxidation procedures (buffer-controlled KMnO4, aqueous NazCr207, H202/CH3COOH, alkaline CuO, alkaline Ag20 and HNO3) used in this study have been described in detail elsewhere Table 1.

A ~3C CP-MAS study of softwood lignin and three artificial coal products AVI-AV3 (see Fig.
Figure 4 plots the f, values vs H/C ratios for artificial coal products and compares similar data obtained for lignites, vitrinites, liptinites, alginites, inertinites and high rank coals such as anthracites.

Loss of catalytic effect by clay has also been found when a reaction was carried out in the presence of air (AVOX, 150, 2 months, Table 1).
Synthetic alginites Highly aliphatic macromolecules similar to those found in coal alginites or type I oil shale kerogen in basic chemical structure were synthesized from algal fatty acids (F1, F2 see Experimental, Table 1, Figs 1 and 4).
