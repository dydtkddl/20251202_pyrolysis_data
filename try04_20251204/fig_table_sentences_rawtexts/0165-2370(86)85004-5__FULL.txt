Experimental variables Variables considered in this study and the ranges are shown in Table 2.
Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen were also employed to study the effect of atmosphere on TABLE 2 Experimental variables Sample pyrolyzed Microcrystalline cellulose powder 0.053-0.074 mm (200-270 mesh) Cellulose particles 0.42-0.84 mm (20-40 mesh) Heating conditions Temperature 310-770 C Heating rate 103-105 CJs Heating interval 0.46 s ** Atmosphere Nitrogen Carbon monoxide Carbon dioxide Hydrogen + nitrogen * Estimated; see text.

The effect of the atmosphere on the product distribution is examined in Fig.
To obtain the gas yields in this figure, the CO yields in a CO atmosphere and the COz yields in a COZ atmosphere were assumed to be the same as those in a nitrogen atmosphere.
Second-order effects observed are summarized in Table 4.
