In 1972, as a result of concern regarding installations which presented a potential explosion hazard or a potential toxic hazard, a circular was issued to Local Authorities asking for any installations which met the criteria reproduced as Table 1, or nearby developments which might affect or be affected by such installations, to be notified to the Factory Inspectorate (Great Britain: Department of Employment, 1972c).
The primary concern of the Advisory Committee was also for those instal- lations which could present a major threat to the safety of the workforce or the surrounding community arising from: TABLE 1 Local Authority definition of Notifiable Installations Industry Materials involving risk Total storage quantity requiring detailed investigation (tons) Petrochemical* and plastic polymer All manufacture Other chemical works Other chemical works Acrylonitrile 50 Ammonia 250 Bromine 100 Chlorine 25 Ethylene oxide 20 Hydrogen cyanide 50 Phosgene 5 Sulphur dioxide 50 Fertiliser manufacture Ammonia 250 Aluminium and magnesium powder All ** production Aluminium refining Chlorine 25 Paper pulp manufacture Chlorine 25 Sulphur dioxide 50 Air liquefaction plants and steel works Liquid oxygen 135 Flour and sugar silos Flour 200 Refined white sugar 200 All Liquefied Petroleum 100 Gas * Petrochemical manufacture is defined as the manufacture of chemicals from an oil refinery product or from natural gas.
Their tentative definition of a notifiable installation is given in Table 2, to which has been added the nature of the risks involved.
The latter, although capable of TABLE 2 Definitions of Notifiable Installations Definition Nature of risk (a) Installations storing or processing toxic material where, if containment is lost, there can be an emission of toxic gases or vapours equivalent in effect to more than 10 tonnes of chlorine.

(6) substances can have equivalent LCso values but the spectmm of toxicity may differ widely on either side of the median lethal dose as illus- trated by Fig.1 (Casarett et al., 1975).

Figure 2 shows the response result- ing from different exposures to chlorine (Sellers, 1976), although there will be some variation in susceptibility.
In view of the many variables, such as windspeed, topography and distance of persons from the point of spillage, it is difficult to estimate the effects 11 CURVE 1-FATAL 2-DAN6ERO 3-D15TRESS 4-COUGHING 5-IRRITATION 6-5WELLING O-l 1 10 100 1000 DURATION OF EXPOSURE (M1N5) Fig.
Hence the committee's distinction between definitions (b) and (e) in Table 2: the former refers to, for example, liquid propane gas and the latter to petroleum.
As an illustration, Table 4 lists a variety of common flammable compounds and, with the excep- tion of xylene, all have flash points below 73; for some the limit of 15 tonnes would be applicable, whilst for others 10,000 tonnes is more appropri- ate.
Using this simple formula, a list of relative evaporation losses has been compiled in Table 4.
However, since the flash points also tend to rise with these limits, further adjustment is perhaps justified to afford more practicable "Butane Equivalents", as shown in Table 5.

Typical high-pressure processes in the Chemical Industry are given in Table 7 (Strelzoff, 1967), most of which are in excess of the 100 bar limit for notification, and Table 8 is a comprehensive list of processes likely to involve pressures equal to, or greater than, 100 bars, and is based on American patent literature up to 1969 (Sittig, 1969).

Several polymeric substances also pose a threat when heated: Table 9 identifies qualitatively those important toxic gases produced during combus- tion of a selection of polymers (Grassie et al., 1975).
