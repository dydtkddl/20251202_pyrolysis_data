The residues of thermal degradation of ATS polymers The residues of thermal degradation at 1020 of ATS and related polymers were estimated 362 Table 1.
It can be seen from Table 1 that a very high proportion of ATP monomer bis[4-(3-ethynyl phenoxy) resorcinol] is converted to involatile 'char' on thermolysis.
It can be seen from Table 1 that the yields of residual material follow this trend with the highest yield corresponding to the material with the highest polyene concentration.
The yields of noncondensable volatile product from ATS polymers follow a similar trend, with the highest Elemental analysis of residues of degradation The carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur contents of residues of the partial degradation of resin from ATS-G were examined by elemental analysis, from which element loss curves were constructed for each element as illustrated in Fig.

Above 600 it is removed from the polymer as methane and hydrogen gas.2 In general terms the changes in the slope of the sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen emission curves may be linked to the 'watershed' transition between processes 1 and 2 of degradation and the later processes (Nos 3 and 4).2 IR spectroscopy of residues of degradation 363 fusions which eventually transform the residue to disordered carbon which is difficult to observe by IR spectroscopy.6 The high boiling point product fraction of degradation Gravimetric analysis Yields of high boiling point products from cured ATS monomer and dimer and ATS-G are depicted in Table 2(a).
The residues of partial degradation of ATS-G under high vacuum conditions were examined by IR spectroscopy yielding spectra as depicted in Fig.

Absorbences were also similar to those contained within the IR spectrum of the cured resin.7 The identifica- tion of sulfones and polyphenyl ethers suggests a product mixture similar in overall composition to Table 2.

The results of a number of simple spot tests on these product fractions and on some reference compounds are related in Table 3.

Our results, expressed as a percentage of the initial sample weight, may be examined in Table 2(b).
As expected, in view of the results summarized in Table 2(a), the relative yield of each sub-fraction increased from ATS monomer through ATS-G to ATS dimer.
Concentrating on products from the ATS monomer and ATS dimer we can see that sub-fractions 3 and 4 are present Table 3.

The parent ion masses so obtained by this method are listed in Table 4.

These most probable structures are depicted in Table 5.
We therefore reproduce, in Fig.
Thus only one is reproduced in Fig.
The broadening of the aromatic resonances towards 8ppm in the NMR spectra suggest (albeit tentatively) that some diphenyl type linkages are Table 4.
Based on a synthesis of these three techniques, the structures collected in Table 6 were identified.
Note the inclusion of bridging sulfones, the (quantitative) absence of Table 6.
TLC eluent fraction 3 (Ry=0.2) By a joint examination of the IR and NMR spectra of material released from cured ATS resin (Figs 6 and 8 respectively) it can be seen to contain some diphenyl linkages (broadening of the NMR spectra toward 8 ppm), massive amounts of hydroxylic material (at 3400cm-1 in the IR spectrum), probably as a result of polyphenyl ether scissions in the polymer; and small quantities of sulfone, most probably as a result of incomplete separation of this fraction from sub-fraction 2.
Parent ion masses were obtained by CIMS and the information synthesized to identify the products listed in Table 7.
The IR and NMR spectra of material from ATS-G are shown in Figs 7 and 8 respectively.
An examination of these spectra indicated the presence of sulfone linkages in some quantity, a relatively large Table 7.
Parent ion masses were obtained by CIMS and the information was synthesized to identify the compounds listed in Table 8.
It must be restated that these products (Tables 9 and 10) must be considered only as representa- tive of the entire high boiling point product distribution of the degradation.
The biphenyl linkage is formed through radical recombination Table 8.

Table 10.
That a product containing both a sulfone and a biphenyl was detected (Table 9, line 7) is proof that the two processes overlap at a heating ramp of 5/rain, Sulfone free phenyl ethers have been assigned (with somewhat less certainty) to the second, less directed process of degradation.
