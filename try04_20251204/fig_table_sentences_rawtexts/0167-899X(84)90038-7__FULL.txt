Experimental The compositional analyses of the commercial alloy, AMCR type, is given in table 1.
An example of the change of the electrical resistivity of AMCR steel with increasing and decreasing annealing temperature and the respec- tive derivatives with respect to the temperature, is shown in fig.

/ Properties of Cr- Mn austenitic stainless steels Magnetic properties Magnetic permeability and magnetic transformations/ Curie temperatures have been determined by using a Faraday arrangement including a small resistance fur- nace by which the temperature of the specimens could be varied between room temperature and 800 (fig.
Differential thermal analysis The AMCR alloy was heated and successively cooled at a linear rate of 20/min in a Dupont 900 thermal analyser (DTA) (fig.
An example is shown for the alloy AMCR in fig.
Again arbitrary units (a.u.) are given in the figure only for the purpose of identifying structural changes during heating and cooling.
Resul~ Electrical resistivity at temperature The electrical resistivity of a deformed specimen increases with increasing temperature showing three dis- tinct features at about 300, 500 and 700 as recogniz- able from the derivative of the electrical resistivity with respect to the annealing temperature (fig.

The main feature, however, is seen in the huge increase of the electrical resistivity during heating when measured at liquid nitrogen temperature, in contrast to the huge decrease of this quantity in the same tempera- ture region, when measured at temperature (figs.
temperature curves (fig.
Calorimetric measurements The AMCR alloy when heated in the as-received condi- tion, i.e., after 16% cold work, in the DSC or DTA, a series of peak appeared (figs.
A major endothermic peak is seen at 280 and an exothermic peak at 580 (fig.
The resistivity changes in the range between 800 and 1000 (fig.
The transformation from c to y occurs in the temperature range between 250 and 400 during heating of a 16% cold worked specimen, as can be seen from the large resistivity increase found during heating (fig.
The c-3, transformation can also be recognized from the endothermic peak between 200 and 350 (figs.
From measurements of the magnetic strength (fig.
This phase transformation has no counter- part measuring the stored energy (figs.
3c and b) or the electrical resistivity at liquid nitrogen temperature (fig.
temperature has a minimum at 500 which may be attributed to the ot'-y transformation (fig.
The chemical composition is given in table 1.
The microstructure of the material as delivered is fully austenitic (fig.
Results and discussion The mechanical properties (tensile tests) at a medium strain rate (3 10-3 s-l) of the AMCR heat-0033, see table 1, in the solution annealed state are shown as a function of temperature in figs.
Calculation of the strain hardening exponents give high values (n - 0.3) up to 600 whereas at higher temperatures T- 900, n is much lower (n - 0.05), see fig.

Analysis of intergranular fracture surfaces has shown that a Li-Cr-N compound (possibly Li9CrNs) is formed at the grain boundary; TEM analysis of the M23C6 carbides also present on the grain boundaries after Li attack has revealed that they are less numerous than those precipitated during heat treatment in the same conditions in the absence of Li and are richer in Cr and depleted in Mn and Fe (table 5 of accompanying paper [22]).
