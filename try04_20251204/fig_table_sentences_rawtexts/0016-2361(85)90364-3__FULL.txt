MATHEMATICAL MODEL An analysis similar to that ofRussel et al.13 provides the approximate characteristic times shown in Table 1 for the relative rate of physical processes compared with chemical reaction at a location in the particle where the stated conditions prevail.
Table I also provides the motivation for the approximations made in this model.
Length scales of interest in Table 1 are the characteristic diameter of pores or tracheids (10/mi) through which volatiles escape and the characteristic size of typical feed particles (1 cm) over which temperature and reaction rate are highly non-uniform.
While the explicit temperature dependence of time scales is shown in Table 1, the implicit temperature dependence of the transport properties is through the instantaneous pore structure, which is quite dependent on reaction conditions.
The authors know of no models that explicitly Table 1 Estimation of time scales for physical and chemical processes during wood devolatilization Characteristic time (s) Microlevel (L=10/mi) Macrolevel (L=lcm) Transport process or reaction T=500K r=nooK T=500K Diffusion, L'/D.ir 10-4 0.3 x 10 -4 102 0.3 (102) Intrapartiele fluid flow", fiLf/pBo 10-6 0.6x10-'' 1 0.6 (I)" Convective heat transfer", L(pc^}../h 10-' >10-' 102 >102 Conduction heat transfer", l!(pCp},/K 10-4 >10-4 102 >102 Solid devolatilization, k, exp(-/.RT) 106 10-2 same as microlevel Drir ^ lO-^s-1' K % lO-'Jm-'s-'K-1' ^ % lO-'Pas h % lOJm- ^-'K-1 p ^ 105 Pa (1 aim) ki % lO's-' BO ^ 10-^m2"'' EI % 140kJmo]-1 K-1 (pc,,), % lO^m-'K-1 (P^)g % 10-'Jm -3^-1 Longitudinal direction b The fluid does not flow over the sides of the particle The permeability, effective diffusivity and thermal conductivity are highly dependent on pore structure and are anisotropic 1506 FUEL, 1985, Vol 64, November Pyro/ysis of a large biomass particle: W.
These implicit tempera- ture effects are not treated in Table 1, owing to their dependence on pyrolysis conditions.
Several important observations can be made from Table 1.
Thus at the macrosopic level, the estimated velocity of volatiles parallel to the Table 2 Model equations Energy equation: Boundary conditions: At t>0, x=0, At oO, x=L, At r=0, Heat capacity: Thermal conductivity: Porosity: Mass balance equations: for all reactions: Reaction, i: S-4Gi S^T, S^*C M^.W Ti-4aG,+/?T, rT ?
In Table 1, a rather short time is estimated for convective heat transfer to occur across the gas film that exists in the wood tracheids (10~i s).
It appears from Table 1 that fluid residence times in the particle are sufficiently long to result in secondary reactions of the volatiles produced by the primary reaction in Table I.
The conclusions derived from Table I are: 1.
In Table 2 (Equation (1)) the unsteady temperature rise of the particle interior is described by using a time-varying global porosity to characterize the internal energy change of the gas and the solid.
Kelbon17 verified that water evolution has a major effect on the intraparticle energy balance, as evidenced by the discontinuities at 373 K in her experimentally measured temperature profiles shown in Figure 1.

The boundary conditions for the energy equation are given in Equations (2)-(5), Table 2.
From the experimental measurements of intraparticle pressure during pyrolysis made by Lee et a!.20 and the characteristic times for fluid flow given in Table 1, this assumption is certainly valid for the high-permeability situation of heating and volatiles escape parallel to the wood grain.
A schematic of the chemical reactions considered and the lumping scheme for gas, tar and secondary gases is also given in Table 2.
For the complex reaction scheme indicated in Table 2, the relative proportions of tar and gas can be altered by mass transfer effects on the secondary reactions (i.e., ^5).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Comparison of the thermocouple measurements (solid lines) with model predictions of the unsteady temperature profile as a function of time at three locations are shown in Figure 2 for the case of an intermediate heat flux and the thinnest particle (0.5 cm).

For the same conditions as Figure 2, Figure 3 compares the calculated and experimental gas release rates.
However, examination of Figure 3 indicates that the time period during which the temperature discrepancy of Figure 2 occurs coincides with volatiles release.
As shown in Table 3, there is satisfactory agreement between predicted and measured gas, tar and char yields for most cases.
The precision of the experimental yield measurements is given in Table 4, where the standard errors of the 1510 FUEL, 1985, Vol 64, November replicates in the design centrepoint are presented as percentages of the mean yields.
While the predictions in Table 3 do not always agree with experiment to within the standard error presented for the replicates, they are generally within 5% of the measured results for nearly all of the conditions studied in the experimental design, and they exhibit the same trends.
The current model was formulated in light of the conclusions ofKansa et al.27 that a single-step reaction model is inadequate to predict weight loss kinetics even when intraparticle forced convection is Table 3 Comparison of experimental results and model predictions for ultimate product distributions from wood devolatilization For L=0.5cm, heat flux= 16.7 xl04 Win"2 Char Tar" Gas Experiment 18 62 20 Model 21 55 24 For L=1.0cm, heat flux=S i^xlO^Wm"2 Char Tar- Gas Experiment 25 62 13 Model 29 58 13 For L=1.5cm, heat flux= ^.PxK^Wm-2 Char Tar" Gas Experiment 23 54 23 Model 27 52 21 The tar yield includes water produced from dehydration reactions but excludes evaporated water from the initial moisture level Pyro lysis of a large biomass particle: W.

At a reaction time of 200 s, when a pseudo-steady temperature profile has been established (see Figure 2), the thermal conductivity at the heated face is higher than that of virgin wood, owing to the contribution of radiation heat transfer.
