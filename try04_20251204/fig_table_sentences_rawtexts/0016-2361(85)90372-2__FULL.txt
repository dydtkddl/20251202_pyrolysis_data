The analysis of this coal is shown in Table 1.
Data from these experiments are shown in Figure I.
Since relatively high concentrations of saturated hydrocarbons were found to interfere with the quantitative determination of several hydroaromatic species by gas chromatography, the hydrotreater con- Table 1 Analysis of 111.

As shown in Figure 1, a maximum coal conversion to toluene solubles was found for hydrogenated cresote oil solvents with a H/C atomic ratio between approximately 0.98 and 1.17.
To illustrate, the plot for the disappearances of tetrahydro- acenaphthene, dihydrophenanthrene and hexa- hydropyrene during the first 4 min of a coal liquefaction run is shown in Figure 2.
The results are reported in Table 3.
