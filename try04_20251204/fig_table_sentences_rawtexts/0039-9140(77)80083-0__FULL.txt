Cadmium oxide reacts with carbon as follows: Cd0(s) + C(s)- Cd(g) + C0(g) Values of AG, and Kp for this reaction at tempera- tures of 700-1000 are shown in Table 3.
Table 4 shows that the determination is quite accurate.
The analytical results are given in Table 5 and are also satisfactory, as were those for oxygen in cadmium (Table 5).
The analytical results are given in Table 6.
These results are summarized in Table 1 and clearly indicate that the values of selectivity coefficients derived theoretically from other electrode models (e.g., ref.

The constants used in these calculations are summar- ized in Table 3.
When the electrode is placed in a lO^Af solution a change of potential may be observed, which corresponds to the change of selec- tivity coefficient due to coverage of the electrode sur- face with AgBr (Fig.
