Based on the assumption of a homogeneous sample, the estimation of crystallite sizes from XPS data finds its origin in the different mean free paths of electrons in carbon and in nickel, that cause a relatively lower nickel Fig.

The Ni(2p3/^) binding energy patterns of the other two samples (fig.

Gasification conditions Table 4 summarizes the XPS results for the samples that were partially gasified at 875 and 1175 K in hydrogen or in nitrogen/steam.
The diameters found after H^-gasification at 875 K are comparable with heat treatment data (table 3).

Nevertheless, the resulting precipitate is finely dispersed (fig.
This is in agreement with TEM results (fig.
Influence of the pretreatment temperature Table 5a gives a compilation of crystallite diameter and fraction metallic nickel data, determined by XPS, XRD and EM for DNiP3 as a function of the pretreatment temperature.
The results of nickel loading variations (table 4) do not give strong evidence for a loading dependency of the sintering phenomena during heat treatment.
Influence of the gas phase composition Similar to table 5a, table 5b gives particle sizes and fractions metallic nickel for DNiP3 after partial gasification.
Also reoxidation and functional group forma- tion under gasification conditions interfere, as can be concluded from the fraction metallic nickel data of DNiP17 after gasification at 1175 K in H-, and H ^0 (table 4).
Due to gasification however, carbon in the vicinity of nickel disappears preferentially (fig.
