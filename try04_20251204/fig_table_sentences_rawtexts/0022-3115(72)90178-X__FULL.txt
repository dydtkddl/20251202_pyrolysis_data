Twenty out of twenty-one pickled specimens annealed in the range 300-600 failed within five hours whereas all three specimens annealed at 650 resisted cracking (table 4).
Generally it seems that annealing treatments sufficient to cause grain growth will prevent stress corrosion (table 4).
Even without annealing, only a very small proportion of tube-reduced specimens (Batches?FACTORS AFFECTING STRESS CORROSION CRACKING OF ZIRCALOY TABLE 4 Effect of vacuum annealing for 2 hour periods on stress corrosion cracking I2 at 300 113 Annealing temperature () 300 300 350 350 400 400 400 450 450 500 500 500 550 550 600 600 600 600 Approximate yield stress (MNm/U) 310 296 276 241 205 172 131 650 3 650 2 700 83 45 Number of specimens Whether surface pickled Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes No No Surface appearance of Zircaloy at start test in I2 bright lustre dull lustre bright lustre bright lustre bright lustre bright lustre dull lustre straw eoloured straw coloured straw coloured straw coloured dull light brown straw coloured straw coloured straw coloured straw coloured straw coloured dull light brown straw coloured dull light brown dull light brown Grain size (/~m) 8 8 8 11 14 15 17 Time to failure (h) 2.5-3.0 0.2-0.5 2.5-3.0 NF (100 h) 2.5-3.0 3.0-3.5 0.5-1.0 2.5-3.0 3.5-4.0 2.5-3.0 3.0-3.5 1.0-2.0 4.0-4.5 3.0-3.5 3.0-3.5 3.5-4.0 4.0-4.5 NF (50 h) NF (100 h) NF (50 h) NF (50 h) NF=not failed, these specimens were plastic when bent into fiat strips after the tests.
Only one failed during testing but four out of thirty-six were embrittled (table 3).
The times to failure of these un- fuelled rings (Batch 9) were in the same range as specimens cut from fuelled tubes (table 5).
The irradiated tubes included Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4 from seven different batches iden- tified in table 5 as Batches 9-15 to distinguish them from the unirradiated tubes described in table 1.
They cracked within 6 h (table 5) and their times to failure showed no strong dependence on fast neutron fluence in the range 2.4--7.1 x 1024 n/m 2 (E> 1MeV), indicating that damage effects saturated within the lower limit of this range.

Table 6 shows the results, and inspection reveals that with one exception, reductions in residual stress result from pickling the outsides of cold-drawn batches but increases are found after pickling the insides.
