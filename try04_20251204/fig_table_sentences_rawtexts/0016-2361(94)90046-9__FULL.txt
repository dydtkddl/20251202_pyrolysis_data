Figure 1 Schematic of screen heater reactor system pressure can exert major effects on devolatilization rates and product yields.
The screen heater reactor (Figure 1} allows a wide range of operating conditions to be studied, including in- dependent selection of heating rate, final temperature and reaction time.
The main experimental conditions are summarized in Table 1.

total weight loss), tar and liquids extracted from cooled chars with pyridine (extractables) as a function of external pressure and peak temperature are presented in Figure 2.
The total volatiles yield increases strongly with increasing peak temperature above 753K, attaining asymptotic values of ~45 and ~40wt% daf coal at 0.1 and 1 MPa respectively, at ~ 1100 K (Figure 2A).
The tar yield (Figure 2B) shows little effect of total pressure below 970 K, an apparent asymptote as the tem- perature increases above ~ 1000K-, and a decline in yield of ~6-7wt% daf coal when the pressure increases from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa in the temperature range 1023-1173 K.
The data of Figure 2 are not sufficiently precise for this possibility to be tested quantitatively, although an increase of 2-3 wt% (of daf coal) in char yield at 1 MPa relative to 0.1 MPa is consistent with the pattern of yields of total volatiles (Figure 2A; char = 100% - % total volatiles) between 850 and 973 K.
The decrease of ~ 6-7 wt% in tar yield above ~ 1000 K with increasing pressure from 0.1 to 1 MPa (Figure 2B) is largely (~ 70-80%) accounted for by an increase in char yield (Figure 2A).
Figure 2B suggests that the tar yield may pass through a slight maximum at ~ 1050 K, although here again the precision is insufficient to test this hypothesis.
The net result is a reduction of total weight loss at higher pressures and elevated temperatures (Figure 2A).
At lower temperatures, the extractables yield (Figure 2C) increases strongly with increasing temperature to > 36 wt% daf coal at a peak temperature of 823 K, at 0.1 and 1 MPa.
Figure 2C indicates that pressure has little effect on it.
This is in contrast to the significant effect of pressure on the yields of tar (Figure 2B) and total volatiles (Figure 2 A) at temperatures where tar secondary reactions are significant, i.e.
Comparison of the significant increase in tar yield from ~ 800 to 950 K (Figure 2B) with the significant and roughly comparable decline in extractables yield over the same temperature range suggests that evaporation of extractables from the coal 900 1100 Peak Temperature, K Fuel 1994 Volume 73 Number 4 593 Pressure and temperature effects in bituminous coal pyroly sis: T.

Pressure has little effect on CO and CO 2 yields (Figure 3), except for a slight increase with increasing pressure, possibly beginning around HOOK and more clearly in evidence at ~1200K.
In particular, yields of the olefins C^F^ and C^ (Figure 4) increase by 60-75% relative.
The saturated hydrocarbon gases CH4, C^Hg and C3Hg (Figure 5), are also generated in greater quantities above 970 K at higher pressure, but the relative increases are smaller than for the olefins.
Table 2 compares yields of most of the major products at 0.1 and 1 MPa and 1173K (by interpolation) and shows significant effects of pressure in this range on the product distribution.

Molecular weights Figure 6A presents data on number-average molecular weight (Mff) for dichloromethane-soluble tars as a function of peak temperature and pressure.
Similar trends are observed in the weight-average molecular weight (Afw) of these tars (Figure 6B), although Mis higher than MM at the same temperature.
The reduction of molecular weight with increasing pressure is further illustrated in Figure 7 by gel permea- tion chromatograms for DCM-soluble tars from pyrolysis at 0.1 and 1 MPa at approximately the same peak temperature (1218 K).

The latter expectation would be in sharp contrast to the decline observed here in tar molecular weight with increasing temperature at high pressure (Figure 6).
Figure 2B and C shows that in this temperature regime there is a relatively modest tar yield but a significant intraparticle liquid inventory (>30wt%).
Figure 8 schematically summarizes this sequence of char morphology changes with increasing temperature.
These results (Figure 8) show that a hollow, thin-walled shell structure is generated in the early stages of pyrolysis, before release of most of the volatiles.
The present results (Figure 8) imply that the particle geometry becomes cenospheric at temperatures below the tempera- ture at which tar secondary reactions become significant (Figure 2B).
For a cenospheric particle geometry, the half-thickness of the cenosphere shell (Figure 9) is clearly a more suitable characteristic length scale for intra- particle transport than is the particle radius.
Moreover, for cenospheres the shell thickness is much less than the shell diameter, so that curvature effects are small, and a Cartesian coordinate system becomes a reason- able simplification to describe the cenospheric particle geometry (Figure 9).
The simplified geometry of Figure 9 should therefore be viewed as an approximation, introduced for computational convenience and intended to depict a reasonable average particle structure with physically realistic length scales.

This reduced by one the number of parameters to be fitted and furnished reasonable values for the kinetic parameters v and V* (Table 3).
It is satisfying that the fitted maximum dimensionless liquid yield V* of 0.47 is close to the combined experimental yields of tar and intra- particle liquids near the yield maximum for internal liquids at 800-8 50 K (Figure 2Q.
Using the Table 3 values for k , a and V*, model parameters to account for tar transport and secondary reaction kinetics were then best-fitted from the data on tar yields and intraparticle liquid inventories over the full range of experimental temperatures.
Table 3 shows results for which the fit requires values of of ~220kJmol~1 and Eo of 2.8 x lO'^K, corresponding to an activation energy for effective diffusion of ~235kJmol~1 (r.
Figure 10A, and of metaplast.
Figure 10B, are well described when the model is parametrized with the numerical values of Table 3.
The curves in Figure 10 are model predictions, and are smoothed between individual data points.
The model captures several important features of the data of Figure 10: (1) the correct pressure-dependence of tar over all temperatures, including the strongest effect at highest temperatures (Figure IOA); (2) the insensitivity of intraparticle liquid inventory to pressure, except for a shift of the l M Pa data to slightly higher peak temperatures (Figure 10B), probably reflecting more rapid cooling at the higher pressure; and (3) the levelling-offand slight reduction of tar yields at high peak temperatures (Figure A).

Other pyrolysis conditions: see Figure 2.
Most of the ~ 30 wt% decline in extractables from 800 to 973 K at 0.1 and l M Pa is matched by a ~25 wt% increase in tar yields (Figure 2), implying that from ~800 to 973 K, tars arise from evaporation of newly formed liquids, with little or no intraparticle secondary reactions.
However at ~ 1000 K, tar and char yields are, respectively, ~6-7wt% lower and ~4-5 wt% higher at 1 vs 0.1 MPa (Figure 2), and tar MW at 1 MPa decreases from ~ 1000 to 1225 1C (Figure 6).
