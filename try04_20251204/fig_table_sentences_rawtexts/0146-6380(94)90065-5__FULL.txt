The LH-NMR spectrum of this product showed only absorbances of aliphatic protons (see Table l).
Elemental analysis (see Table 1) revealed that the product does not contain oxygen.
Compound 7 was identified by MS [Fig.
l(a)] and by JH-NMR (see Table i).
One main distinction between the products of the two aldehydes was that the non-conjugated C=C double bond of 5 was not affected by the nucleophilic attack by poly- Table I.

Elemen- tal analysis (Table l) showed the absence of oxygen, and a high S/C ratio fitting a polysulfide cross-linked structure.
Compound 9 was identified by its MS [Fig.
l(b)] and by IH-NMR (see Table 1).
Elemental analysis (Table l) showed the absence of oxygen.
Depolymerization of the product with MeLi fol- lowed by MeI gave rise to 1,1-di(methylthio)-3,7- dimethyloctane (10) as the major product [Fig.
2(b)] as identified by MS (Fig.
lc) and by IH-NMR (see Table l).
