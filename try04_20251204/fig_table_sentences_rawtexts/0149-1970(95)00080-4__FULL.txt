Furthermore, the elements are conical (see Fig.
2.1 for a schematic representation and Figs.
The following sections discuss a series of sensitivity results based on all of the above reactor designs (described in Table 4.2.2), since not all sensitivity calculations were carried out on a single design.
1) Figure 4.2.1 shows the sensitivity of the multiplication factor (keff) to the fuel element pitch/diameter ratio (x), and the number of fuel elements, assuming the same fuel volume.
Finally, the two curves shown on the figure illustrate an advantage in having a core with 61 elements, which has higher values of keff at all values of x.
Figure 4.2.2 shows the difference in keff at two temperatures with beryllium volume fraction in the moderator.
