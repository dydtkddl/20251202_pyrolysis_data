The kinetic data obtained from the model compounds are also shown in Table 5.
The specific systems for which accurate data are required for PET reactor analysis are shown in Table 6.
Griehl and Forster (1956) studied equilibrium poly- condensation and presented data in the form of DP as a function of reactor pressure as shown in Fig.

If the polymer contains number of acid end groups, the achievable DP will be limited and there should be a family of curves in Fig.
