Western economies have spent close to $100 billion ( 1980 fig- ure) to develop the nuclear energy option, and yet this represents only 2% of the energy consumption [I]; in the United States, this option is essentially at a stand- still.
Figure 4 illustrates the variety of interrelationships between classes of solar energy conversion and hydro- gen production technologies [ 9 ].
