Coal resources represent 90~o of all known fossil energy resources.14 Reserves assumed to be recoverable with current technology are esti- mated to be 291 billion short tons with total re- sources far in excess of this amount.13 Deposits of coal are found in 38 states, underlying about 13% of the total land area as illustrated in Fig.
Electric utilities are the largest coal consuming sector by far and account for most of the growth in coal consumption.~7 In 1989, 86% of coal consumption went into generating electricity and about 55% of the electricity was produced from coal.14 The United States coal consumption by sector between 1974 and 1995 is presented in Table 1.
Coal Processes Most of the coal presently being consumed is by direct combustion of finely pulverized coal in large- scale utility furnaces for generation of electric TABLE 1.

The main differences are in coal particle sizes and in gas and coal velocities2~ as shown in Fig.
Another important difference is in gas and coal temperatures.22 Typical gas and coal temperature profiles for coal gasifica- tion processes are presented in Fig.

Two different viewpoints concerning devolatiliza- tion are shown in Fig.
The traditional viewpoint (Fig.
This theoretical viewpoint is illus- trated in Fig.
Table 9 gives a general reaction scheme for kinetic, physical, and structural devolatilization models.
Table 9 also gives a summary of several devolatilization models (e.g.
Table 9 includes some of the more complex kinetic models such as the Functional Group model (FG model)2 which assumes the coal to consist of functional groups (i.e.
hydroxyl, carbo- xyl, etc.) that evolve as a first order process (model 12 in Table 9, Refs 205 and 206).
The FG model was improved by adding a Depolymerization, Vaporiza- tion, and Cross-linking submodel (FG-DVC model) and incorporating mass transport effects for tar (model 21 in Table 9, Ref.
Table 9 also contains a lattice statistic model based on percolation theory (Chemical Percolation Devolatilization model, model 22 in Table 9, Refs 122 and 173).
Details on the various escape mechanisms and the influence of macromolecular configuration on evolu- tion rates cannot be deduced from the reaction schemes given in Table 9.
More information on de- volatilization models can be found in the references listed in Table 9.
These reviews include those by Walker et aL,2t7 Essenhigh,2xs,219 Laurendeau,22Smith,TM Skinner and Smoot,222 Saxena,xts and Smoot.223 Although study of particle sizes in the fixed-bed range (1-10 cm) are scarce, the general consensus is that coal particle size is the most defining parameter with respect to the dominant reaction mechanism of large particle combustion and gasification.X6 Combustion and gasification of coals TABLE 9.

Possible reactions occurring on or within the char particle during oxidation or gasification are shown in Table 10.2z22.
Previous reviews Char reactions are often thought to occur in one of three temperature dependent regimes in a porous particle as discussed by Walker et aL 217 These three regimes are shown in Fig.
In this chemical reac- tion regime, the concentration of the reactant throughout the particle is equal to the bulk reactant concentration as depicted in Fig.
The apparent order of the reaction and activation energy are smaller than the actual order of the reaction and activation energy as shown in Fig.
These reactions are shown in Table 10.

By analogy to Newton's law of cooling, the oxi- dizer diffusion rate can be expressed as: rod'g = MwoAp(Ci,~ -- Ci.s)l(l/km + I/kefr) (22) where r'', kin, kern Mwo, Ap, Ci.,, and C~.s represent the rate of diffusion of the oxidizer (kg/s), film mass Combustion and gasification of coals TABLE 1 1.

Figure 30 shows the rate of mass release during sequential devolatilization and oxidation proc- esses for the five test variables: temperature, flow rate (Re), oxygen percentage, initial mass, and coal rank.
FIG.
Figure 30 (1200 K) showed that lignite, which contained the highest ash level (16.6% ash on a dry basis), devolatil- ized most extensively and then oxidized most slowly compared to the other three chars.
The effects of ash layer thickness Combustion and gasification of coals 551 and effective diffusivity on burning rate of the lignite coal cylinder were shown in Fig.
The measured burn- ing data shown in Fig.
Figure 31 illustrates the effects of the test variables.
Figure 31a shows a strong dependence of burning time on initial mass for several coal chars, but little effect of coal type when initial mass is constant.
Increasing air flow rate reduces burning time, fur- ther supporting the role of external diffusion as shown in Fig.
At temperatures less than 1000 K, burning rate is also reduced as temperature is decreased, suggesting the onset of kinetic rate limita- tions as shown in Fig.
Figure 31d shows that total char mass was far more important than surface area, a somewhat surprising result.
These data also consistently showed that the cube root of instanta- neous mass varied linearly with burning time during most of the oxidation period, as shown in Fig.

Burning times for the 0.1-0.2 g coal particles were in the range of 3 to 10 min in the higher air flows, generally consistent with the observations of Ragland and Yang.z52 Results suggest significant dependence of char oxidation rate on initial particle mass (Fig.

Several physical properties of the gas and particle phases are required to obtain mass and heat transfer coefficients needed to solve the differential equation set in Table 16.
The JANAF tables were used to provide values for calculating gas-phase en- thalpy, entropy, and heat capacity.343 Dulong's for- mula66 was used for heating value of the char, Mer- rick's correlations63 were used for char enthalpy and heat capacity, and the Kopp-Neumann rule was used for ash heat capacity.232 The solid-gas heat transfer coefficient was taken from Gupta and Thodos65 but adjusted by a factor accounting for chemical reactions in the bed (0.1 to 0.5).
