A subsequent rearrangement then produces water and a 5-hydroxymethylfurfural moiety (see Fig.

46 attention to the fact that it could be obtained in fair yields from the rapid pyrolysis of slightly impure celluloses-; approximately 18% yield was obtained from a cellulose powder containing 0.04`& ash (Table 1).
The amounts obtained by fast pyrolysis of untreated wood are approximately in proportion to the cellulose content (Table 1).
In particular acetic acid, formic acid and acetol have been obtained in yields in the range 5%-10% (Table 2).
The same is true of levoglucosan isomers like 1,6-anhydroglucofuranose (Table 2) and the dimer cellobiosan (Table 3 and ref.
Indeed we accepted such a scheme in earlier work (Fig.
Nevertheless Richards [9] has argued that it is more likely that hydroxyacetaldehyde forms directly from cellulose by a plausible mechanism involving dehydration followed by a retro-Diels-Alder reaction (Fig.

[5] showing the variation of levoglucosan and hydroxyacetaldehyde yields with temperature are compatible with either mechanism (Fig.
Our current working model is therefore that cellulose decomposes by three major parallel pathways with one or another being dominant according to temperature and catalysts present as illustrated in Fig.

Contrariwise, we have noticed that cellulose samples that gave higher levoglucosan yields lose weight at lower temperatures (Fig.
We were not able to correlate DP with levoglucosan yield for the celluloses listed in Table 3 but one sample which had been heated to 53 100 I F - I: o I 100 200 I.

This was demonstrated by showing that the data from a fluidized bed reactor could be joined smoothly with the data from a transport reactor, as shown in Fig.
Several authors have made estimates of the overall rate constant for secondary cracking of the tar in the vapour phase (corresponding to kT in Fig.
