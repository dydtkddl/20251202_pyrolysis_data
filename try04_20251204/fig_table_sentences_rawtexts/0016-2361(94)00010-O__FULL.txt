A schematic representation of the wood fibre is shown in Figure 1.
The model also considers simultaneous solution of the following heat and mass transfer equations (see Nomenclature for meanings of symbols): mass transfer: -VNA+F(~-E,) rF_lk L&2~A_a(ECA) r;-rf at (2) --_______--- Figure 1 Schematic representation of a wood fibre re -k, -VNc+re(l-s,)-- rg-rf ck,C,== (3) at heat transfer: V*kVT-1 N~C,VT-F(I-EJ j &I _&JCA~ Cc,WHj I j cc;; (4) Note that both heterogeneous (at the wood surface) and homogeneous (in the gas phase) reactions are included.

In other words, the pellet is not at a constant temperature of 490 as indicated in Figure 2, but it increases gradually to this value owing to the nature of heat transfer.
The same equations were applied to carbon gasification at various temperatures, and an excellent fit was obtained, as shown in Figure 3.
The results at 900 are given in Figure 4.
The results at 800, 850 and 900 are given in Figure 5.

Further acceleration then occurs owing to the decrease in particle density and size, which are both very significant as shown in Figure 7, and owing to the increase in gas velocity.
The temperature histories at the particle surface and centre are shown in Figure 8.
