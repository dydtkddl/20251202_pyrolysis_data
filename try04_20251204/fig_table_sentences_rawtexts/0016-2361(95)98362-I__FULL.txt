EQUATIONS Conservation equations The conservation equations for the one-dimensional, fixed bed model, FBED-1, are listed in Table 1.
Table 1 shows only the 38 conservation equations for gas and solid phase.
The equations presented in Table 1 are the gas and solid overall continuity equations, gas and solid energy equations, and gas and solid species, as well as elemental continuity equations.
Overall gas and solid continuity equations The overall gas and solid continuity equations are given by Equations (1) and (2) in Table 1.

Equations (5)--(26) in Table 1 are solved only when the gas phase is assumed to be out of chemical equilibrium.
Gas phase elemental continuity equations The mass rate of change of each reactive element in the gas phase is given by Equations (27)-(31) in Table 1.
It should be noted that tar is treated as a pseudospecies in the gas phase; therefore the gas phase elemental continuity equations, shown in Table I, include the contribution of tar.

Auxiliary equations The set of auxiliary equations for FBED-1 is essentially the same as that for MBED-1 (Table 2, Hobbs et a1.6).
