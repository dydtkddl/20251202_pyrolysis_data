Reduction and reductive methylation in these systems produce structural transformations shown by functional analysis (Table 1 and Figure lb} and by i.r.
Performic acid oxidation strongly increased the content of carboxylic oxygen (Figure lb}.
However, carboxylic oxygen represents only a third of the total organic oxygen in the oxidized vitrain (Table 7).

As can be seen from Figure 6, for model compounds under the present experimental conditions, part of the carbon monoxide is converted to carbon dioxide through disproportionation below 550.

DISCUSSION Correlations between pyrolysis products and structural parameters, and among pyrolysis products Figure 7 presents correlations between oil or gas yields and available structural parameters.
Oil and carbon monoxide yields are negatively correlated (Figure 8a), and show opposite correlations with structural parameters: 1.
Figure 7e shows that molecular hydrogen yield is better correlated with the VcHarA'c^+cio ratio.
Figure 7d show that in the case of chemically modified coals, in contrast to the series of bituminous coals and kerogens10, oil yield is poorly correlated with H/C atomic ratio.
A much better correlation is found for molecular hydrogen yield (Figure 7i).
Figure 7j shows a correlation between molecular hydrogen yield and hexane-toluene-THF solvent extraction performed by Cagniant et al.2.
Molecular hydrogen yield is also negatively correlated with methane yield (Figure 8e ), and positively correlated with carbon monoxide yield (Figure 8j], As expected, methane yield shows a positive correlation with isothermal oil yield (Figure 8d).
In the same fashion as in Figure 8d, the methane:molecular hydrogen ratio allows methylated and non-methylated samples to be distinguished.
Figure 8h shows a positive relation between molecular hydrogen and molecular nitrogen yields, indicating that nitrogen groups have some structural and thermodynamic similarities with aromatic CH.
The increase in hydroxyl group content results in a decrease in oil yield (Figure 2).

products {Figure 2b), and also by the increased yield of methane (Figure 3).
Performic acid oxidation of the original vitrain does not change the H/C atomic ratio when the 0/C atomic ratio is increased (Figure la).
0-methylation produces minor complementary effects, but enhances CH4 and CO evolution (Figure 3}.
Less char implies less molecular hydrogen and nitrogen evolution, as observed in Figure 4 after LiAlH4 reduction and after 0- methylation.
