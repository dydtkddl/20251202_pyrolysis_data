Those attributes of TLC that distinguish it from HPLC are summa- rized in Table 1.

Those applications for which TLC is often selected as the primary method of analysis are summarized in Table 2 [1].

These two com- plementary approaches are not difficult to imple- ment in TLC and add considerably to the prob- lem solving capacity of the method while retain- ing some, if not always all, of the attributes defined in Table 1.
The velocity constant depends on external parameters such as the saturation level of the vapor phase in contact with the layer as indicated in Fig.

One possibility would be to reduce the flow resistance of the layers but this would be difficult to achieve since the flow resistance characteristics of the layers are already close to their anticipated minimum value (Table 3).
A 703 (1995) 573-612 581 nisms, it is possible to migrate a zone a consider- able distance without significant zone broadening beyond that observed for the first development, as indicated in Fig.
In its most common embodiment forced-flow development is performed using the overpres- IllM |g ~ o 0 m ~ N die m 4m MI GR/kT~ OISTANCE Fig.
The broken line on the left.hand side of the figure represents the change in spot size due to the expansimt and contraction stages in multiple development and the solid line depicts the expected zone width for a zone migrating the same distance in a single development.
This problem can be circumvented by increment- ing the position of the solvent entry position to maintain a fixed distance below the slowest moving zone in the chromatogram at each de- velopment step, as illustrated in Fig.

For mixtures of a wide polarity range, gradient multiple development is invariably required as demonstrated by the sepa- ration of poly(ethylene glycol) oligomers as their 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl esters (Fig.
In this way the zone capacity is not limited by the useful development length for the layer established by the mobile phase velocity under capillary controlled flow and can be much larger than that predicted for a i~vl~t3t~l~cr 0123456 0123456 cm Fig.
The optimum conditions for separation by multiple chromatography can be summarized by the comments in Table 4.
A 703 (1995) 573-612 Table 4 Optimum conditions for isocratic multiple development 587 (a) Multiple chromatography (1) Resolution is controlled primarily by the zone center separation since zone widths are relatively constant after the first few developments (2) The maximum zone center separation for two solutes of similar migration properties occurs when the zones have migrated 0.632 of the development distance (3) The maximum resolution observed is largely independent of the average RF value for the zones although if the average R~ value is low, a large number of developments will be needed to reach the maximum resolution value (4) Difficult to separate compounds should he repeatedly developed with solvents that produce low RF values corresponding to the most selective mobile phase for the separation (b) Incremental multiple development (1) Increment the solvent entry position to maintain a fixed distance below the lowest zone (i) zone separation is increased due to the longer migration lengths achieved (ii) zone widths are reasonably constant throughout the chromatogram (2) Increment the solvent front migration distance (i) avoids moving portions of the chromatogram into the solvent front region (ii) enables resolution to be optimized throughout the chromatogram.

The TLC plate is scanned in the normal way with a slit slightly wider than the spot diameters (Fig.

The capillary orifice was positioned close to the layer which was supported on a translation table that enabled its position to be moved with respect to the detection of components in the effluent by the flame ionization detector.
The apparatus consisted of a thermostated fluid deliv- ery system, a micro-extraction autoclave that could be sealed at its exit by a shut-off valve, and a narrow capillary of 25-50 /tm internal diam- eter positioned a few millimeters above the TLC plate located on a translation table.
