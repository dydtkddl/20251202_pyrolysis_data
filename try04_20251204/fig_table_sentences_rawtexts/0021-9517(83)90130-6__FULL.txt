RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Untreated Catalyst Figure la shows the mid-infrared spec- trum of the untreated catalyst.
Table 1 lists the frequencies of the observed infra- red absorptions of the catalyst and assign- ments of the bands based on group fre- quency compilations (77).
Also given in the table are the frequencies of infrared absorp- tions of two reference compounds, neophyl chloride and ?-butylbenzene, and of f-bu- tyibenzene adsorbed on alumina.
Comparison of the catalyst spectrum to the reference compound spectra shows that the neophyl ZIRCONIUM POLYMERIZATION CATALYST 199 TABLE 1 Infrared Absorption Maxima of Tetra(neophyl)zirconium Reacted with Alumina Polymerization Catalyst and Model Compounds (cm"')" Catal yst Neoph (liqu ylCI id) /-Bu benz adsor on alu tylene bed mina (-Bu benzc (liqu ylene d) Assignments 3160 W 3106 sh 3111 W 3110 sh 3108 w 3087 m 3090 m 3088 m 3088 m 3063 m 3061 m 3061 m 3061 m Aromatic C-H str 3034 m 3035 m 3035 m 3035 m Aromatic C-H str 3024 m 3026 m 3024 m 3023 m 2962 s 2973 s 2968 s 2962 s CH, asym str 2928 s 2938 sh 2930 sh CH; in phase str 2910 sh 2915 sh 2910 m 2903 s 2868 s 2887 m 2873 s 2868 s CHs sym str 2876 m CH; out of phase str 2805 sh 2817 W 2800 W 2777 W 2750 sh 2749 W 2730 sh 2735 W 2715 W 1943 W 1955 w 1940 \W 1882 W 1873 W 1885 W 1885 W MONO substituted 1868 aromatic ring C- 1800 W 1802 W 1820 w 1798 W H overtone and 1743 W 1748 W 1743 W combination bands 1670 W 1676 W 1670 W , 1600 m 1602 m 1600 m 1600 m Aromatic skeletal 1580 m 1583 W 1582 w 1583 W Aromatic skeletal 1540 W 1535 W 1496 s 1498 s 1498 s 1497 s Aromatic skeletal 1470 m 1473 s 1471 m 1469 m CH; def.

Figure 2 shows the C-H stretching region of the spectra of catalysts of several TNZ to alumina ratios.
Figure 3 shows the peak absorbance of the 2960 cm"' methyl C-H stretching mode as a function of TNZ to alumina ratio.
Ethylene uptake by untreated catalysts shows a similar dependence on TNZ/alu- mina ratio (Fig.
Figure 5 shows the hydroxyl bands of alumina reacted with several amounts of TNZ.

Figure 13 compares catalysts of four TNZ/alumina ratios after heating at 470 K in vacuum.
Figure 14 records the changes in the DRS spectra of 470 K treated catalyst after expo- sure to ethylene or air.
Active Sites A flaw of spectroscopic studies of cata- lysts such as this one lies in the uncertainty that the spectroscopically characterized ZIRCONIUM POLYMERIZATION CATALYST 209 320 500 WAVELENGTH (nm) 700 FIG.
Similar activity for the polymerization of ethylene was observed in three types of samples that differed in treatment and spec- troscopic properties: NZA synthesized at room temperature with an infrared spec- trum showing only intact neophyl ligands; NZA treated in hydrogen at 420-520 K with neophyl ligand ir absorptions replaced by a 1900 cm"' absorption assigned to Zr-H; and NZA heated above 470 K in vacuum with no infrared absorptions assignable to organic or hydride species but exhibiting 320 500 WAVELENGTH (nm) 700 FIG.
