A typical scanning electron micrograph for the 50% graphite PFC particles, which re- veals irregular shapes with typical maximum dimensions of 74-149 /~m, is shown in Fig.
Chemi- cals used in the LC-ED eluents were obtained at Fig.
Results and discussion The results of the batch studies are shown in Fig.

We also investigated a more exten- sive mixture of components containing DA, NE, DOPAC, HVA, 5HT, 5HIAA, ACh, Ch and the internal standards DHBA, nMET and EHC, all at concentrations corresponding to those found in or appropriate to a rat striatal tissue homoge- nate; injection of 10 /xl of such a mixture revealed a chromatogram indistinguishable from that seen in Fig.
