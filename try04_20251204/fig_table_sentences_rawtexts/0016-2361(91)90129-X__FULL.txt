The TGA results for heating these coals at 400 for 5 min are shown in Table 2.
for Rasa coal is shown in Table 3.
The amount of weight loss expected, based on light gas evolution (Table 3 for Rasa coal), is compared in Table 2 with the actual weight loss found in the TGA for the same heating conditions.
The results of comparable calculations for the other coals are also shown in Table 2, and indicate that most of the weight loss can be accounted for as evolution of light gases.
The results, using the S/C ratios determined by XPS, are shown in Table 1.
The results of these calculations are shown in Table 4.
Figure 1 gives the TPD H^S (M/e=34) spectra for three different Argonne premium coal samples.
To compare the traces in the figure, the mass spectral signal intensities from each coal were normalized such that the total initial amount of organic sulphur (mole per cent sulphur basis) present in each coal were similar.
The very sharp H^S evolution spike at high temperature, seen to a greater or lesser extent in all cases (see also Figure 2 for Illinois no.
This sharp spike is not apparent in coals with high organic sulphur and very low inorganic sulphur content (see Figure 3 for Rasa coal).

The total evolution of H^S below 750, expressed as mole per cent relative to the amount of initial sulphur present, is shown in Table 5 for four different coals along with a break down into lower temperature (T= 400) and higher temperature (400 <T< 750) components.
Figure 4 shows the XANES absorption spectra and corresponding third derivatives for the 400 chars produced from Mequinenza lignite, and Illinois no.
The numerical results for the chars are shown in in Table 6 (expressed in terms of aromatic sulphur content).

Results of these calculations are shown in Table 6 along with the XPS and XANES data.
The XPS and XANES results for the transformation of sulphur during coal pyrolysis are displayed in Figure 7.
The two solid points in Figure 7 were determined by XANES for Mequinenza and Illinois no.
Table 6 shows that on a mole per cent sulphur basis these coals release between 15% and 50% sulphur upon subsequent heating to 750.

For example, a comparison of the initial mole per cent aliphatic sulphur for the Mequinenza, Charming Creek and Rasa samples (determined by XPS and XANES) with the total mole per cent sulphur evolved as tS below 750 is shown in Table 7.
The close correspondence for the Charming Creek coal is somewhat deceptive since the XPS and XANES results (Table 6) indicate that some conversion of aliphatic sulphides to aromatic forms has occurred.
