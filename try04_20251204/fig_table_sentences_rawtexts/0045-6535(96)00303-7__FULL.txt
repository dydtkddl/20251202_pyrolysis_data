1981 1982 EXPERIMENTAL "Fne apparatus used for carrying out the combustion has been described in detail (6) and is shown in Figure 1.
A collection unit consisting of a water trap and a cartridge filled with XAD-2 (8 g) is attached to the end of the combustion chamber as shown in Figure 1.
The combustion of the solid matrix was carried out as follows: the connections were made as shown in Figure 1, with the exception that the syringe was disconnected and the entrance plugged.

Effect of solvent on the formation of Dhenazines: Similar mounts of tribromo- and tetrabromo- isomers were formed in both the solvents at 550 and a residence time of 6 seconds as shown graphically in Figure 2.

Effect of solvent on the formation of earbazoles: The formation of carbazoles in different solvents at oxygen level of -+12-15% and a residence time of 6 seconds is shown graphically in Figure 5.
Their yields were in parts-per-miUion levels (Fig.

The results of combustion are shown in Table 3.
It is clear from the table, as the amount of antimony trioxide was increased, the formation of phenazines decreased sharply and the yields of other products like bromobenzenes, bromophenols, and bromoanilines were also reduced.
