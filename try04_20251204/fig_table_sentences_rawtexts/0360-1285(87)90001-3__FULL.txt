Mean mixture fraction and density at x/d = 25 show that the jet spread is predicted quite well but the centerline mixture fraction is about 10% too low (Fig.
Correspondingly, since the gas is predicted to be closer to stoichiometric, the temperature is higher by about 150 K than measured in the central region (Fig.

The effectiveness of line- and point- SSOR (symmetric successive over-relaxation) methods using various numbers of grid levels is evident from convergence paths of the transport and pressure correction equations (Fig.
The calcula- tion is for the curved diffuser with 45 x 21 x 21 nodes (Fig.
Figure 29(a) suggests that a more elaborate solution method is needed for the pressure correction equation only, whereas the point-SSOR method is sufficient for the velocity and scalar transport equations.
Differences between line- and point-SSOR methods for the pressure correction equation, as well as differences between various levels of grid utiliza- tion, are shown in Fig.

Such a 2-D grid is shown in Fig.
If desired, this grid can be remeshed using a variational method (Brackbill and Saltzman, 198214), to compromise between orthogonality and smooth- ness, as shown in Fig.

Figure 34 shows the original (uniform) and the adapted grids with 41 26 nodes, and the corres- ponding numerical solutions.
It may be reiterated that since the characteristics of the shear layer in such configurations depend upon the expansion ratio as well as on the inlet flow condition, to distribute the grid based on physical intuition may not be accurate, as reported for a different problem by DeVahl Davis and Jones (1983).26 To investigate the effects of the grid size on the numerical accuracy, a uniform grid with 81 x 51 nodes and the numerical solution are shown in Fig.

Selected physical models, numerical techniques and grid generation methods described in the preceding sections have been used to simulate flow in a modern turbofan-engine combustor (Fig.
Within a single sector of 18span, there are five dilution holes (two primary and three secondary) on the curved top and bottom surfaces (Fig.
Calculations are conducted for the flow in the sector, with periodic boundary conditions on the two side planes, on a grid of 45 x 23 25 nodes along the ~-(inlet/outlet), ~/-(top/bottom), and 7-(left-right) coordinates, respectively (Fig.
