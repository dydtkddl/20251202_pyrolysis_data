The yield of coke from cracking bitumen-sand mix- tures (Figure 9) is higher than from cracking bitumen alone at the same temperature and reaction time.
The slope of the bitumen-sand curve (Figure 10} is much steeper than for bitumen alone.
The yield of heavy oils from cracking bitumen alone is apparently linear with temperature (Figure //).
