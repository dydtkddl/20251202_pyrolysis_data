According to Equation (15a) the time-dependence of total nitrogen eluted is ^ih=WhUl-exp(-fcLt)] (16) In Figure 1 the experimental results are reported as ^,=IOO-H>?/(/N,) (17) where N^ is the nitrogen content of the coal charged (for Illinois No.
The data of Figure I were regressed according to Equation (16) with the constraint that [W^}y, be the same for the three runs.
The /CL values resulting from the regression are reported in the Arrhenius plot of Figure 5.

This procedure gave the parameters reported in Table 2.
The values of(W^)^ and (^211)00 reported in Table 2 can therefore only describe a trend in the release of sulfur-containing compounds.
Thus it may be concluded from Table 2 that most of the primary sulfur compounds released by the coal are relatively light compounds that react to produce hydrogen sulfide and light mercaptans.
