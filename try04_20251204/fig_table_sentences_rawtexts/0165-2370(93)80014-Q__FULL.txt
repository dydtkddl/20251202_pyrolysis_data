Table 1 shows the ultimate analysis of soot trapped in the cooler and the washing bottles, while Table 2 contains the analysis of the deposited soot on the inner surface of the reactor.
Table 3 indicates the amount of carbon and chlorine from HCB present in the decomposition products.

As shown in Tables 1 and 2, there is a significant difference in the elemental composition at 1100 C for the two kinds of soot.
The results given in Table 3 show that at 1000 C roughly one quarter of the carbon initially present in HCB is recovered in the soot, and about one quarter of the chlorine ends up in the soot and as molecular chlorine.
