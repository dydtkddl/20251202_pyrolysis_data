The kinetic constant k is given by the Arrhenius law Figure 2 shows the residual rate of wood as a function of time for three different temperaturesThe linear variation of In (1--1") shows that the reaction is of first order with respect to the unconverted wood.
The activation energy of the reaction Ea and the pre-exponential factor ko are calculated from the Arrhenius plot (see Fig.

Solvolysis of cylindrical pieces of wood Concerning the solvolysis of the cylindrical pieces of wood, the conver- sion curves have the characteristic shapes shown in Fig.
The penetration of the solvent across the internal matrix has been visualized--see photographs (Figs 5 and 6).
Figure 5 shows a wood sample after 50 min of reaction by when 38% of the conversion has oc- curred.
Figure 6 shows a wood sample after 90 rain of reaction under similar conditions.
