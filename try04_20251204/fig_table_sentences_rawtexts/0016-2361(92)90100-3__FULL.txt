(Keywords: coal; effluent; gasification) A schematic diagram of a large-scale, fixed-bed gasifier is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 also shows the reactor divided into four zones : ( 1 ) drying ; (2 ) devolatilization ; (3 ) gasification ; and (4) combustion.

TWO-ZONE PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL Foundations and assumptions Typical temperature and concentration profiles in a large-scale, fixed-bed gasifier are illustrated in Figure I.
Energy balance Control volumes for three equilibrium model options are shown in Figure 2.
The energy balance around any control volume shown in Figure 2 is : A.out - ^g.oul^g.out -6=0 s,out s,out (1) where m is mass flow rate (kg s~1), h is total enthalpy (J kg~1) and Q is heat loss (J s~1); the subscripts s, g, in and out refer to solid, gas, entering control volume and exiting control volume, respectively.
The total equilibrium model shown in Figure 2a assumes complete reaction of the dry ash free coal by either devolatilization, gasification or oxidation.
This assumption is relaxed in the two-zone partial equilibrium model of Figure 2c.

The ultimate analyses of coals for the test cases were performed several years ago and do not correspond exactly to the ultimate analysis of the eight coals of similar rank with measured functional groups as listed in Table 1.
Both the measured ultimate analysis for the test coals (Table 2} and measured functional group compositions from similar coals ( Table 1 ) were used to estimate the functional group composition of the test coals based on the method of Serio34.

Predicted exit temperatures using the partial equilibrium model, given in Table 3, were higher than the total equilibrium predictions for the bituminous coals.
The one-zone models did not give reasonable exit temperature predictions or exit composition predictions for the Rosebud subbituminous coal case (see Table 3 and Figure 8).
