Monomer concentrations were plotted as functions of the total conversion in Figure 3: it indicates that styrene and butyl acrylate have reached a pseudo-stationary state after approx.
Free acrylic acid tends to accumulate up to 30% conversion whereafter it decreases slowly; this phenomenon is a result of the water to polymer ratio dependence of the partition ratio Km of acrylic acid (see Table 2).
Results are listed in Table 3: the best value for A would lie somewhere around 0.6 which is coherent with what we found in Figure 1 (A = 0.7tool l-I).
This finding, however, is in good agreement with our expectations: as stated in the previous section the averaged critical chain length for ":i Abu 0 20 40 60 80 100 Conversion (%) Figure 3 Residual monomer (weight percent of monomer referred to the latex) vs.

Figure 4 shows the fractions of carb- oxylated materials found at the particle surface and in the serum phase.
The ratio buried/(aq.sol.+grafted) should only be affected by the Km of acrylic acid during the reaction, which according to Table 2 does not change that much with the acrylic acid level.

curves of the water soluble polymer exhibit a bimodal distribution shown in Figure 6, while in the case of styrene-butyl acrylate only unimodal elution curves were observed; let us first consider the peak centered at about 4000gmol-]; an interpretation of the second polymer population at M, = 1000 g mol-~ will be given later in this section.
The rate of disappearance of residual acrylic acid, as can be seen in Figure 5, is well predicted by the model.
Table 3 shows some of the simulations run with different values of A.
