The liquid pyrolysis product spectrum (Figure 5a) showed various sharp signals associated with straight chain hydrocarbons, such as Cl at 14 ppm, C2 at 22.7 ppm, C3 at 32 ppm and C4 (and higher) at 29 to 30 ppm.
The absence of the carbonyl peak in the product spectrum (Figure 5a) supports the observations deduced from the i.r.
spectra (Figure 3b).
As expected, an ester carbonyl peak at 1748 cm"1 and CH stretchings at 2910 and 2850 cm -1 were observed in the canola oil spectrum (Figure 2h).
The peaks at 2910, 2850, 1720 (very weak), 965 and 907 cm"1 (Figure 3c) clearly indicated that the liquid pyrolysis product of canola oil contained a mixture of alkanes and alkenes.

It is quite obvious from the peaks at 2910, 2850, 1718, 965 and 910cm-1 (Figure 3e) that the glycerides have been converted to a mixture of hydrocarbons by liquefaction.

The gas Chromatographie retention times for the standard hydro- carbons are presented in Table 4.
Gas chromatography showed, in particular, the cracking of the hydrocarbon chains with a preference for C6 and C7 products in triolein and canola oil pyrolysis (Figures 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Figure 7 Gas chromatograms of the pyrolysis products of: (a) triolein over activated alumina, (b) canola oil over activated alumina Table 4 Gas Chromatographie retention times for the standard hydrocarbons Standards Retention time (min) n-Hexane 3.00 n-Heptane n-Octane 4.07 6.55 n-Nonane 9.50 n-Decane 12.71 n-Undecane 16.20 n-Dodecane 19.36 n-Tridecane 22.25 n-Tetradecane 24.80 n-Pentadecane 27.70 n-Hexadecane 29.79 FU EL, 1992, Vol 71, November 1295 Fuels and chemicals from sewage sludge.

Liquid pyrolysis yield The percentage yield of liquid pyrolysis products of triolein, canola oil, trilaurin, and coconut oil are shown in Table 1.
As can be seen from Table I, the actual liquid pyrolysis yields obtained were slightly lower than the theoretical yields in the cases of triolein and canola oil.

Degree of unsaturation of liquid pyrolysis products Results of the hydrogation of all liquid pyrolysis products are shown in Table 5.
It is obvious from Table 5 that only hydrogation of the trilaurin pyrolysis product yielded the expected number of carbon atoms per double bond.
