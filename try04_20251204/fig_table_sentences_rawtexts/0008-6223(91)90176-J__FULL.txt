A typical analysis of the gaseous contents of a reactor is given in Table 4 for the coking of anthra- cene at 510°C for l h under 6.9 MPa N3.
For the coking conditions given in Table 4, the yield of PI was 63 wt%.
For the conditions given in Table 4, less than 0.1 wt% of the anthracene charged to the reactor was converted into gaseous products.
At a conversion level of 63 wt%, the same level applicable to the gas analysis given in Table 4, the change in the C/H ratio of the PI indicated that 3.6 moles of H atoms / mole of anthracene converted to PI had been lib- erated.
In addition, the lack of production of significant quantities of low-molecular-weight hy- drocarbon gases (on a mole of gas per mole of an- Table 3.

It is possible, therefore, that for conversions to PI in ex- cess of 63 wt% (the level of conversion correspond- ing to the data of Table 4) considerably higher concentrations of H; gas will be produced.

This is shown in Table 5, with zero reaction time corre- sponding to pure anthracene, which is completely soluble in pyridine.
Data are shown in Table 6 for coking of anthra- cene at 465°C for times up to 2 h under 6.9 MPa N2.
For times greater than 0.75 h at 465°C, there is appreciable decay in Table 6.
