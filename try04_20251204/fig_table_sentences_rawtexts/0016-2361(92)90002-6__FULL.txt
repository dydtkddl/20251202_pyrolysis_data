In Figure 2, the kink in the dense phase curve at z = 0.275 m corresponds to the point in the bed where the bubble size has reached the maximum allowable size due to the restriction of the vertical heat pipes.
As expected, 0^ conversion (Figure 2) and CO concentration (Figure 3) are both higher in the dense phase than in the bubble phase.

Oxygen conversion profiles at several different gas flow rates are presented in Figure 4.
The effect of varying only the mean particle residence time, t, upon the overall coke conversion, x, is shown in Figure 5.
The net coke conversion for the single-sized particles, x, can be found as a function of F according to : x=- (1 -e-^) T (41: The coke conversion predicted by these approximate calculations at T = 575 is shown in Figure 5, compared with the solution found by the simulation.
Figure 6 presents fractional coke conversion, x, in the second stage combustion reactor as a function of cumulative residence time in both reactors for base-case operating conditions.
It may not be possible to operate a fluidized bed reactor (in the bubbling regime) with such a small mean residence time of 150 s, but this serves to demonstrate the dramatic increase in conversion 10000 Cumulative mean particle residence time (s) Figure 6 Effect of two beds in series.
