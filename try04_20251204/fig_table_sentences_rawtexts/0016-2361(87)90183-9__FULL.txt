Figure 3 displays values of conversion versus flow rate for 0.5 M ethanol at 34.5 MPa and 385 in the presence of lOmM H2S catalyst.
Data displayed in Figure 3, together with our general experience during the past two years, indicate that the reproducibility of our measurements is good.
Table I displays representative data for selected ethanol dehydration experiments.
Low yields of ethene relative to other gaseous products indicate the important role of free radical chemistry when acid catalysts are Table 1 Ethanol dehydration in water at 34.5 MPaReaction conditionsProduct yields" cone.
We attribute the low selectivity of this experiment to the gaseous (non-polar) properties of water under these conditions (see Figure 1), which do not facilitate the dissociation of H^SO^.
Figure 4 displays the effect of residence time on conversion at various temperatures, with particular emphasis on data at 385.
The rate at 395 is the same as that at 385, suggesting the loss of catalytic activity as water loses its ionic properties at temperatures approaching 400 (see Figure 1).

In agreement with the findings of earlier workers49, data displayed in Figure 4 are not easily modelled by simple rate laws.
The acid-catalysed dehydration of n-propanol in supercritical water results in the formation of only two products: propene and i'-propanol (see Table 2).
This lack ofreproducibility is reflected in the variable (and sometimes poor) carbon balances given in Table 2.
Treating the propanol dehydration reaction as first order in propanol and plotting the data given in Table 2 in the standard fashion51 we obtain a calculated equilibrium conversion of 0.85 and a forward rate constant of 0.0196s"1 at 350, with a correlation coefficient R= 0.995.
Ethylene glycol is relatively stable in supercritical water (see Table 3}; however, 0.005 M H^SO^ catalyses its rapid dehydration to acetaldehyde.
As shown in Table 4, glycerol is also relatively stable in water at 34.5 MPa and 300.

As shown in Table 5, acrolein was observed to be a major liquid product of the crossed aldol condensation; thereby supporting the role of the reverse aldol mechanism in the formation of acetaldehyde.
The other liquid product of the reaction, crotonaldehyde, forms by a conventional aldol condensation of acetaldehyde, followed by dehydration (see Table 5).

The degree of product selectivity evidenced in Tables 1-5 suggests that the use of very dilute mineral acids as homogeneous catalysts in supercritical water may have many commercial applications.
