It was found that the reactor walls have some activity {Figure 1), and that the use of a glass liner did not decrease it significantly, consequently the experiments were conducted without the liner.
CO conversion versus time results, obtained in the presence of H;S, CoMo oxide, CoMo sulphide, H^S- CoMoS and during blank runs, are shown in Figure I.
Figure 2 shows the kinetic data obtained during the WGS reaction studies plotted according with Equation 1, showing excellent agreement.
The reaction rate constants, obtained from the slope of each line, are summarized in TableS along with catalyst and solvent used.
The activation energies obtained from an Arrhenius plot, listed in Table 3 for the studies without solvent, clearly shows that the CoMoS catalyst is the most active, and that H^S decreases the activation energy when added to the reaction.
Addition of organic solvents to the reaction medium decreases the reaction rate constants as shown in Table 3.

Symbols as in Figured Addition of iron sulphate catalyst in the form of aqueous solution of various concentrations, as well as impregnated into the coal feed, and in the presence of CO and CO/H^S, slightly decreased conversion (Table 4).
The iron acetate catalyst gave slightly higher conversion than iron sulphate with the toluene and THQ solvents, but it was less active with the tetralin solvent (see Table 4).
A summary of the effect of catalysts in conversion is displayed in Figure 5 for both the water/CO and water/CO/HzS system.
