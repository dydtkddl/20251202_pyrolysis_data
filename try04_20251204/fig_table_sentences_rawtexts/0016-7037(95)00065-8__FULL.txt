.) of pure supercritical water are close to that of pure subcritical liquid water (250-374.15) when pressure rises (Fig.
RESULTS Effects of Pressure during Confined Pyrolysis The analysis of the extracted solid residues obtained after confined pyrolysis of Woodford shale shows an atomic H/C ratio and a Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index ( HI ) , which both decrease with pyrolysis temperature (Table 1).
At 260 and 300, the Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index increases with increasing pressure: during the bitumen generation stage, the oil potential decreases less rapidly at high pressure (Fig.
3, Table 1).
During the main stage of kerogen thermal breakdown, the Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index decrease ( 300-330 ) and the maximum yields of bitumen and expelled fraction are reached (Table 1).
The strongest pressure effect is noticed at 300-1300 bars, where the TSOM yield decreases Pyrolysis of Woodford shale from 9 to 7.5 wt% (Table 1) .
The polar yields (in mg/g of initial shale) show similar evolution, with a slight reduction at 300 when pressure reaches 1300 bars (Table 2).
The distribution of the C 5 n-alkanes in the TSOM fraction obtained from confined pyrolysis experiments at various temperatures show minor variations with increasing pressure (Fig.
At 330 and 350, the n-alkane chromatograms from the samples pyrolyzed at 300 and 1300 bars are similar (Fig.
Effects of Pressure During Hydrous Pyrolysis The H/C atomic ratio determined on the extracted residual kerogen show clear variations (Table 1 ), although, the accuracy of the elemental analysis measurements do not allow these effects to be directly interpreted in terms of pressure effects.
Better information is obtained when plotting the corresponding Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index (HI) against pyrolysis temperature (Fig.
3, Table 1 ): in the time-temperature range investigated, the residual oil potential is higher when water pressure is increased.
This effect is most evident in the pres- 1593 600 -1 WD26 X 500 W 400 ~ W ~ 300 O t;o 200 loo CP 300 bars CP 700 bars CP 1300 bars + HP <300 bars HP 300 bars HP 700 bars e HP 1300 bars 0 IN 0 + 1 month 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 PYROLYSIS TEMPERATURE () FIG.
The classic hydrous pyrolysis values (P < 300 bars) of either H/C atomic or Hydrogen Index do not always fit into that scheme, possibly explained by the fact that pressure also modifies the rate of decrease of the Hydrogen Index (the shape of the HI curve is modified; Fig.
An increase of water pressure from classic hydrous (P < 300 bars) to 1300 bars lowers the amounts of TSOM at all temperatures (Fig.
The corresponding bitumen and expelled fraction yields also decrease with increasing pressure (Table 3).
Conversely, increasing pressure strongly decreases the total polar yield at all temperatures (Table 2) and shift the maximum of production to higher temperatures.
The maximum yield of total aromatics appears between 330 and 350 at TABLE 1.
TABLE 2.
Whatever the pyrolysis temperatures investigated, no significant changes in the overall C 5 n-alkanes distributions are noticed with pressure (Fig.
Major differences between the results obtained during confined and hydrous pyrolysis that can be observed: (1) The atomic H/C ratio and the Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index of the extracted solid residues are always higher in classic hydrous pyrolysis than confined pyrolysis when T > 300 (Table 1; Fig.
(2) The extent of the pressure effect on bitumen, expelled fraction, TSOM and polars yields is greater during hydrous pyrolysis (Tables 1, 2, 3).
However, the yields obtained during confined pyrolysis are similar to those measured in the 300 and 700 bars hydrous pyrolysis experiments (Table 1) .
(3) Confined pyrolysis experiments yield greater amount of aromatics (Table 3).
(4) In order to compare the saturate hydrocarbon distributions of the confined and hydrous pyrolysis TSOM fractions, the saturate hydrocarbon GC traces were normalized to the Cn-alkane (Fig.
Neither the weight loss nor the yields of TSOM are affected by the presence of excess liquid water (Table 4).
Pyrolysis of Woodford shale However, the composition of the TSOM is modified and the addition of water mainly increases the saturates yield (Table 4).
Expulsion in Hydrous Pyrolysis In hydrous pyrolysis, increasing water pressure strongly lowers the expulsion yields of polars, aromatics, and saturates (Table 5).
This effect is not simply related to a lower generation of these compounds at high pressure: the expulsion efficiency (Expelled/TSOM ratio) is also lowered with increasing pressure, indicating a net decrease of the ability of the oil to leave the rock (Fig.
During classic hydrous pyrolysis, latroscan data show that the saturate hydrocarbons generated with increasing maturation are affected by a partitioning effect leading to their enrichment in the expelled fraction and conversely their depletion in the bitumen (Fig.
The C hydrocarbon chromatograms clearly evidence that lighter molecular weight n-alkanes are preferentially expelled (Fig.
Iatroscan data indicate that high pressures lead to a greater enrichment of saturate hydrocarbons in the bitumen (Fig.
Conversely, the differences in C 5 saturate hydrocarbons distributions observed between the expelled fraction and bitumen during classic hydrous pyrolysis disappear at high pressure (Fig.

Several factors might be responsible for this effect: (1) The hydrostatic pressure provided by the water surrounding the rock chips was greater than the internal pressure TABLE 3.

The very different behavior of the kerogen in confined and hydrous pyrolysis suggests that pressure cannot be considered as a unique parameter, but that the nature of the pressurizing medium plays TABLE 5.

Effects of the presence of water Despite the absence of additional water inside the confined pyrolysis system (the presence of excess liquid water in the reaction cell is often considered as being necessary to promote oil generation), the TSOM yields obtained are similar to those of hydrous pyrolysis experiments performed at 300 bars (Table 1).
For example, the dielectric constant (E) of water is not only temperature dependant but also strongly pressure dependant (Frank, 1978; Fig.
In addition, the pressure effect on this parameter at 60-200 has almost no effect on the dielectric constant of pure water (Fig.
