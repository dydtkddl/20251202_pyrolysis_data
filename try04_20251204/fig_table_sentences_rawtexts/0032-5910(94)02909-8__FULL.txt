Parameter selection The parameters in the model are predetermined as follows (input parameters selected for some of the data sets are shown in Table 4).
Table 1 shows measurements of Peclet number, Pe=uoD/D~, in CFBs with and without solid circulation.
The initial response times of these ther- mistors give an indication of the velocity of the front of the tracer plume, as shown in Fig.
The assumption is indicated with the straight line in the figure.

This height is used for the normalization rather than the 0 cm height because the solid flux at the injector exit is out of the range of solid fluxes shown in Fig.
This is illustrated in Fig.
The effect of axial diffusion is illustrated in Fig.
The temperature signal as a function of time at the 90 cm height resulting from axial diffusion of a perfect pulse is shown as the 'Diffused pulse' in the figure.
