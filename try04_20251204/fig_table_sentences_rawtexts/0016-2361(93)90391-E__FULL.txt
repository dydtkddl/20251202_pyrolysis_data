Table 1 shows the temperatures for the start and finish of the main weight losses, and the temperature of maximum rate of weight loss for the two main peaks of the DTG curves and also the intermediate temperature for rice husks, cellulose (microcrystalline), hemicellulose and lignin for the heating rates used.
The points at which the temperature were assigned are defined in Figure 5.

Bester Figure 6 Total gas yield from rice husk pyrolysis in the static batch reactor static batch reactor.
Figure 6 shows the composition and total gas yield of the gases evolved with increasing heating rate.
Table 3 shows the activation energies and the pre-exponential factors for the pyrolysis of rice husks at different heating rates at the temperature regimes shown in Table 1, for the two prominent groups of reaction and for the overall decomposition.
The overall activation energies for the rice husk decomposition in Table 3 show a decrease with increasing heating rate.
Boateng et al.11 also used TGA to study the decomposition of rice husks at heating rates of 40, 80 Table 3 Kinetic parameters for the decomposition of rice husks by TGA Heating rate ( min'' 20 40 80 Temperature regime/ Pre-exponential Activation overall factor, A energy, decomposition (s-1) (kJ mol"1) Low 1.96 x 10" 100.1 High 5.56 x 109 143.2 Overall 8.84 x 106 108.8 Low 4.46 x 10" 134.6 High 2.24 x 108 131.5 Overall 8.47 x 105 105.3 Low 1.35 x 107 110.3 High 7.25 37.2 Overall 4.7 x 104 85.9 Low 5.37 x 107 98.2 High 5.25 x 102 28.6 Overall 1.12 x 105 84.9 and 160 min 1 ; they reported a mean activation energy of 183kJmol~1 and suggested there was no influence of heating rate on the activation energy.
The data presented here for rice husks clearly show an influence of heating rate on the activation energies for the overall decomposition and also for the two prominent groups of reactions, at both low and high temperatures (Table 3).

He also suggests that the physical form of the cellulose and the presence of trace Table 4 Kinetic parameters for the decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose in microcrystalline form and as Whatman no.
This is supported by the data in Table 4, which show a marked difference in the activation energies for cellulose in microcrystalline form compared to that in the form of Whatman no.
