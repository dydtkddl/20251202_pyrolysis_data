Tables 1 and 2 show that the pitch contains 2.0 wt% ash, 3.6 wt% of which is vanadium, expressed as vanadium pentoxide.
As shown in Table 5, the baghouse ash from combustion of the pitch in condition 3 contained 2430 ppm vanadium.

As shown in Table 4, an increase in the Ca: S molar ratio resulted in an increase in NO,, as reported in most earlier CFBC studies (e.g.

The experimental conditions and some overall results are presented in Table 6.
Because of the low ash content (see Table 1), there was no tendency to sinter and no need for periodic draining of oversize material from the combustor; continuous addition of limestone was sufficient to maintain the overall solids inventory for the duration of the runs, forming a stable bed in which the rate of attribution was equal to the rate of limestone addition.
The sulfur capture efficiency for all nine runs is plotted in Figure 5.
The influence of Ca: S ratio on NO, emissions is shown in Figure 6.
N20 emission was insensitive to the Ca: S ratio but was high, in excess of the NO, emission, as shown in Table 6.

However, calcined limestone can also catalyse NO, reduction by CO according to the reaction 2C0 + 2N0 --+ NZ + 2C02 (7) The petroleum coke has a low volatile matter (see Table 1) compared with the pitch.
Figure 7 shows NO, profiles along the centreline for two cases; run 17-1 with no limestone added and Run 17-2 with limestone added to give Ca: S = 2.5.
The char from the petroleum coke appears to have low reactivity for NO, reduction as shown in Figure 8.
To bring the concentration down to the flue gas level of 268 ppm (see Table 6), it is clear that additional NO, reduction must have occurred in the primary and secondary cyclones.
Figure 9 shows longitudinal profiles of N20 concentration at the three different lateral positions for condition 1 of run 17.
Detailed analysis of sulfur species in solids withdrawn from five different positions around the CFB loop at the conclusion of run 17, condition 2, are presented in Table 7.
The procedures suggested by Becker et a1.17 were therefore used to allow the calcium sulfide to be determined separately, using a wet chemical procedure specific to this compound (see Table 7, footnoted).
