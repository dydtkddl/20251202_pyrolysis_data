Representative numerical values used herein are provided in Table 1.
Inspection of Table 1 shows, for instance, that 45% of all unit sheets in the model contained nine or fewer aromatic rings, 50% of all particles possessed three or fewer unit sheets, and 66% of all unit sheets with five aromatic rings con- tained two or fewer saturated rings.
The numerical values in Table 1 were selected from a composite view of asphaltene structure and composition (Speight, 1972, 1980; Speight and Moschopedis, 1981; Yen et al., l984a, b) and were subject to the constraint that the average structural parameters calculated for the reac- tant asphaltene were consistent with literature values.
That the distribution of probabilities for aliphatic chains given in Table 1 is reasonable is confirmed by the reported presence of long-chain n-alkanes (up to C36) in asphaltene pyrolysates (Simm and Steedman, 1980; Savage et al., 1985; Ritchie et al., 1979; Rubinstein et al., 1979; Rubinstein and Strausz, 1979), the detection of long (>C6) n-alkyl substituents in asphaltenes by 3C NMR (Takegami et al., 1980), the calculation of average alkyl chain lengths of three to eight carbons (Ah and Al-Channam, 1981; Boduszynski et al., 1977; Koots and Speight, 1975; Speight, 1970, 1971; Yen et al., 1984a, b), and the nearly equal weight yields of long n-alkanes from asphaltene pyrolysis (Savage et aL, 1985).

This is illus- trated in Fig.
Having determined the number of ahi- phatic substituents in the unit sheet, the alkyl chain (or linkage) lengths were then determined by comparing random numbers with the cumulative probability distribution for alkyl chains in Table 1.
Since each asphaltene particle was assembled inde- pendently and randomly from the data in Table 1, any combination of aromatic rings, saturated rings, and (1) ahkyl substituents with non-zero probabilities could be selected.

The accuracy of these approximate correlations is indicated in Fig.
The structural data in the probability dis- tributions, listed in Table t for the reactant asphaltene, were then updated to reflect the effects of pyrolysis, and 10,000 unit sheets were assembled as reaction products.
The product particles were assigned to one of the solubility-based product fractions on the basis of their molecular weight and H/C atomic ratio as illustrated in Table 2.
Note that dctcrmining the solu- bility of numerous compounds in both heptane and toluene and using their molecular weights and H/C ratios to correlate the results could improve the rules of Table 2.

Those for the reactant asphaltene, reported in Table 3, are clearly consistent with the ranges of parameters reported in the litera- ture (Yen et at, 1984a, b; Ah and Al-Ohannam, 1981; Boduszynskiet at, 1977; Speight, 1970, 1971; Suzuki et al., 1982; Yen, 1974) for petroleum asphaltenes.
The temporal variations of the particle and unit sheet number average molecular weights are illus- trated in Fig.
The particle molecular weight distri.- bution, parametric in time, is displayed in Fig~ 5.
The Fig.
Figure 5 shows that the molecular weight distribution for the reactant asphaltene was broad and that simu- lated asphaltene pyrolysis reduced the average mol- ecular weight and the width f the distribution even at short reaction times.
