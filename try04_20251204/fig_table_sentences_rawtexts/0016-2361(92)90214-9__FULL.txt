Ultimate analyses of these materials and reference minerals are given in Table 1.
Apparatus The apparatus consists of two vertically aligned fluidized beds (7.6cm internal diameter) which share a common fluidizing medium and which are heated externally by two dual-zone (each zone independently controlled) electrical resistance furnaces (see Figure I).
In the mode where solids are continuously fed to the upper bed, the bed height is maintained by one of the two angled standpipes located above the distributor (not shown in Figure I).
A typical coking sequence is illustrated by the CO^/Ar ratio in Figure 2a.

Taulbee A similar response was observed for the NOa/Ar ratio, and in most cases, the curves tracked the CO^/Ar response almost exactly {Figure 2b).
Figure 3 illustrates that a reduction in the CO^/Ar ratio could only be due to deposition onto the solids in the upper bed.
Also shown in Figure 3 is the tracing of argon concentration which illustrates two points : first, the noise associated with Ar is much lower than that of the CO^/Ar ratio; second, overall system response is very rapid as demonstrated by the negative spike in Ar concentration due to the first valve switch and the positive spike from the second valve switch.
The raw shale is fed to the reactor by a screwfeeder, and by nature, screwfeeders cannot feed -2024681 Time, minutes Figure 3 QMS response to shale oil vapour exposure to Ottawa sand at 853 K for 5 min: a, CO^/Ar ratio (44/40 m/e ratio); b, absolute Ar intensity (relative units) solids without pulsation.
Because of the high noise levels, integration was not done directly, but a least-squares curve was fitted to the data and the area between the fitted curve and a least-squares line fitted to the baseline data was determined (see Figure 4).

The QMS-determined carbon uptake data are compared with the data determined by post-run analysis in Figure 5.
For example, gasified oil shale, which contained approximately 7% carbon before the coking treatment, deviated more from the unity line than the illite sample which contained less than 1 % C {Figure 6).
