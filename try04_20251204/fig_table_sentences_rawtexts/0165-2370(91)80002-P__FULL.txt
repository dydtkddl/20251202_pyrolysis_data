This mixture is then directed to the connecting pipe (Fig.
There, two precision valves Vl and V2 regulate the flow towards two possible directions: directly to a GC analysis system through a purification system (Fig.

The gas compositions and the average lowest heating values (LHV) are also reported (Tables 1 and 2).
On the contrary, the gas obtained with alkali and alkaline earth metal catalysts has the highest TABLE 2 Average composition of gas from isolated tar pyrolysis at 600 C in the presence of various catalysts supported on graphon.
For each catalytic preparation, we report the gas composition, the LHV of the gases and the ratio r, of the Ts obtained using the support without deposition and with deposition of a catalytically active salt (Tables 3 and 4).
Deposition on inactive supports, SAS and SCS (Table 3) The results show that the deposition of Ni(N03) 2 and Na ZC03 improves the catalytic activity of alumina.
However, this improvement is not so high as expected from previous results (Table 1 and the literature).
The reason might be a plugging of the pores, the average diameter of which is rather low (50 and 100 A respectively), by agglomeration of salt molecules during 278 TABLE 3 Gas composition (molar %), LHV (MJ/Nm3) and r (ratio of the times necessary for tar to be completely pyrolyzed, in the presence of the catalyst support with and without catalyst) Gas SCS SAS component 700' C no catalyst 6~' C 600 C Ni Na No catalyst Ni Na HZ 26 40.1 28 31.5 57.4 34.9 CO 30 16.5 10.1 12.4 13.3 15.2 CH4 26 13 29 32.7 10.9 29.6 C0Z 16.3 28 28.8 17.9 16.6 18.5 CZH4 1 0.7 2.5 4 1.4 2 C2H6 0.7 1.7 0.8 1.6 0.4 0.9 LHV(MJ/Nm3) 17.1 12.8 16.8 20.3 13 17.9 Ratio (r) 1 0.43 0.79 1 0.39 0.77 drying at 105 C.
