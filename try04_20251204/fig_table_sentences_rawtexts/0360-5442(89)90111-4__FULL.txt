Since the extent of dissociation increases monotonically with temperature, the quench fraction, the measure of our success in cooling the effluent fast enough to prevent its recombination, also goes through a maximum, as is shown in Fig.
(The assumption of second order rather than first order dependence on the driving force does not fit our experimental observations.) Thus, at temperatures below about 1800 K, in dissociating, the mixture is approaching a composition which will yield a given quench fraction, cs> at the rate (1) 1.5r 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 Temperature, K Fig.

The temperature of the quenching tube is the parameter in the figure, and the equilibrium mixture from an 1800 K reactor has been assumed to have been immediately cooled to the quench tube temperature and then maintained at that temperature.

We therefore used the GCKP program of Bittker18 with the kinetic constants of Table 1 to calculate the extent of dissociation to be expected in a gas phase dissociation process in a given length of reactor tube at a temperature equal to the nominal reactor tube temperature.
