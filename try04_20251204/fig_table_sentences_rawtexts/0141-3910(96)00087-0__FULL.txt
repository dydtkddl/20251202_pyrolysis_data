The flow scheme of the plant as it was used in the actual experiment is shown in Fig.
The contents of heavy metals in the material and the lime is documented in Table 6.
2.3 Pyrolysis conditions The parameters of the pyrolysis experiment are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 gives the freeboard residence time.
Due to the high temperature, the pyrolysis SEPARATION PRODUCT PREPARATION Fig.
To explain this, Table 2 shows the mass balance of the pyrolysis experiment referring to total organic input.
Benzene, toluene, Table 1.
Thermal degradation of mixed plastic waste 193 Table 2.
Table 3 presents the results of the elemental analysis and the content of the inorganic material in the product fractions.

Table 4 shows the balance of chlorine for the experiment.
Table 5 shows its results.
From Table 4 it can further be seen that the largest part of the chlorine was found in the distillation residue and the solids.
To analyze the distribution of the heavy metals among the products, a selection of different important heavy metals were analyzed Table 4.

Table 6 shows the results of the analysis.
Table 7 contains the results of two other experiments that were performed at Hamburg Pyrolysis plants.
To demonstrate the influence of steam as a fluidizing gas on the fluidized bed pyrolysis of MPW, the results of a laboratory scale Table 6.
