The full ultimate and proxi- mate [22] analyses, and heat of combustion are given in Table 1.
Table 1 includes values of specific heat, thermal conductivity, and ther- mal diffusivity required for the heat transfer calculations.

Quantitative Behavior The quantitative results are illustrated in Figs.

The resulting pyrolysis/burn-off in the first 10 s was about 10% of the mass but 24% of the volume (see Fig.

Since the mass and volume (Figs.

These terms were evaluated as functions of time, using empirical curve-fits to the experi- mental mass and volume curves shown in Figs.
For the mass (Fig.

Combustion The experimental combustion behavior is given as Line A in Fig.
[8] When this is normalized against the initial particle mass to correspond to the Fig.
[9] This is the equation of a curve that varies with d, and thus with time, whereas the actual slope as shown in Fig.
Consequently, it does not evidently describe the gradient of Fig.
This is very close to the Ko values for the initial transient in the first 10 s, and for the final char burnout, noting that the gradient for the initial transient is very similar but that for the final char combustion is substantially lower (see Fig.
