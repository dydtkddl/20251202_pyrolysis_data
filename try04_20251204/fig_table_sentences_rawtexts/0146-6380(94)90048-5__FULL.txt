SAMPLES AND METHODS Oil shales were sampled from two exposures of the Kuonamka Formation, of Middle Cambrian age, located in North West Yakutia, Siberia (Fig.
MOZZHELINA Fig.
The bitumen of sample 6/14, extracted from a shale containing Type 1I kerogen, differed from that of sample 6/8 (charac- terized by Type I kerogen) in that it had a lower total vanadyl porphyrin content (0.66 and 1.69 mol/g, re- spectively), a higher relative content of C30D (Fig.
2) which may have been derived from chlorophyll c (Serebrennikova et al., 1987) as indicated by the C~oD C31D C32D Fig.

HPLC fingerprints of vanadyl por- phyrins, separated from the bitumens of samples 6/8 and 6/14, are shown in Fig.
Pyrolysates of the Type II kerogen (sample 6/14), obtained by stepwise flow thermal extraction with benzene, had a higher vanadyl porphyrin content (Table 1) and a stability of "porphyrin coupling" with the kerogen matrix which was greater than in the case of Type I kerogen.
The pyrolysate obtained from Type I kerogen (sample 6/8), heated at 270, as well as from the corresponding unheated bitumen con- tained DPEP porphyrins as major porphyrin com- pounds, while that obtained from Type II kerogen contained ETIO porphyrins with ~-unsubstituted I I | | 0 10 20 30 40 | | g m| I 0 10 2030 40 Retention time (min) Fig.

In the case of our Type II kerogen, an increase in heating time led to a redistri- bution in the relative contents of the ETIO porphyrin isomers (Fig.
The pyrolysates of the two kerogens obtained at 370 'C, had a similar porphyrin composition (Table 1) and both contained low molecular weight ETIO porphyrins (the shift in the porphyrin series to those with a lower carbon number, with increasing pyrol- ysis temperature, was also noted by Van Berkel and Filby, 1987).
