Our observations of the bed appearance during this incident are summarized in Fig.
Also indicated on the same figure are the cumulative observations we made of the patterns of char accumulation or gasification, and the quality of the offgas throughout our tests run in the quartz reactor with noncatalyzed bed particles.

The shaded regions on the right-hand figure show the equilibrium compositions on a dry basis for a range of R values 3<R<7.
These trends are presented in Fig.
The operating conditions for all of the experiments are summarized in Table 1.
Figure 6 shows the mole fractions of HZ, CO, CH4 and COz evolved in the noncatalyzed alumina bed at 1100 K for tests in which R was varied from 3.7 to 6.5.
Figure 6 also shows similar results for a test at 1370 K performed with catalyst in which R was varied from 3.8 to 5.9.
