A quadrupole mass analyzer was combined with a gas chromatograph and with an IR ray thermobalance as shown in Fig.
Variation of the voltage from an ionization gauge for the mass analyzer was also recorded as an evolved gas detection curve with a TG curve- RESULLTs Pyrolysis-gas chroraalography Figure 2 shows a typical gas chromatogram of the decomposition of PTFE at 700 C in a helium gas atmosphere.
About 34 peaks appeared for C, to C8 fluorinated compounds, corresponding mostly to perfluoroparaffins, perfluoroolefines, and perluorocyclic compounds as summarized in Table 1.

An activation energy for the evolution of C2F.& from PTFE was calculated by taking an Arrhenius plot to be 86_4 kcal mol' (m/e: 50) or 86.1 kcal mol-1 (m/e: 81) as shown in Fig- 4.
The copolymer clearly decomposes in two stages in a helium gas atmosphere as shown in Fig- 5.

As is shown in Fig 8, the degradation of PTFE or FEP in air is characterized by separation of the reaction into two stages, and no sharp boundary exists as the beating rate is increased.
Figure 9 shows the DTG curves of FEP in an atmosphere of oxvgen.

When the I.R spectra of FEP heated at 545 C in a helium gas atmosphere was compared with that of non-treated PTFE, there seemed to be little difference in the spectra In the presence of air or oxygen, -CFO radicals are observed in the decomposition of FEP, but the existence of the radicals is not observed in the decomposition of PTFE as shown in Fig.
In the decomposition process of FEP with pyrolysis^GC, most of the C.F can be regarded as being produced at a temperature range of 450-550`C (Fig.
