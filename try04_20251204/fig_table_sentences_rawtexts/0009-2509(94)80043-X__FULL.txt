These values for E0 were determined from a listing of hydrogen abstraction rate constants given as Table IX by Poutsma and Dyer (1982).
Finally, note that the reaction path degeneracy for steps 45 and 46 is given as 0.11 in Table 2.
Some of the Arrhenius parameters listed in Table 2 differ from those we used previously for analogous reactions in modeling methyl- and ethylpyrene pyro- lysis (Smith and Savage, 1992) and some differ from values used by Freund et a!.
Figure 2 displays the model s prediction (solid lines) for the molar yields of DDP, methylpyrene, and dodecane for DDP neat pyrolyses at 375, 400, and 425 C.
Figure 2 shows that the model tends to under- predict the reactivity of DDP at all three temper- atures, but the model predictions nrc often within the estimated experimental uncertainty of 15% of the reported values.

Figure 2 shows that the model predicts this feature at a DDP conversion of about 20%.
Thus, to verify more explicitly that the model does indeed predict autocatalytic kinetics we offer Fig.

Figure 4 compares model predictions with the experimental data of Smith and Savage (1991a) for DDP pyrolyses at dif- ferent initial concentrations.
Inspection of Fig.
The calculated rate being slower than the ex- perimental rate at high concentrations was also evi- dent in the neat pyrolysis results of Fig.
Of course, bettter agreement between the model and experimental results might have been ob- tained by adjusting the reaction rate constants, but DD1 CONCENTRATION (mollL) Fig.

Table 3 lists the molar yield calculated for each of the products and radical intermediates from DDP neat pyrolysis at 400 C and 90 mm.
Table 3 shows that the radicals P2 and p~ had molar yields at least an order of magnitude higher than the yield of any other radical.
Figure 5 displays the rates of the six different steps that transfer hydrogen to the ipso position in DDP as function of flOP conversion at 400 C.

Figure 5 also displays the rates of two other RHT steps.
To summarize, Fig.
We explored the influence of the RHT steps further by excluding these reactions (steps 24 29, 32 36 in Fig.

Table 4 lists only those coefficients with absolute values greater than 0.001.
Inspection of Table 4 reveals that the calculated concentration of flOP is most strongly influenced by the rate constants for steps 3, 14, 2, and 37.
Note that this result from the sensitivity analysis is fully consistent with the high yield of a-DOP radicals noted earlier in our dis- cussion of Table 3.
Table 3 shows that a-dodecylpyrene radicals (#2), non-ipso alkylhydropyrenyl radicals (ps), and methylpyrenyl radicals (/J~) had much higher yields than any other radicals.
The reduced mech- anism is shown as the first column in Table 4.
The identities of the species in Table 4 are the same as in Fig.
The sensitivity coefficients calculated for the neat pyrolysis of DDP at 400 C for 120 s using the reduced reaction mechanism are shown in Table 4.
