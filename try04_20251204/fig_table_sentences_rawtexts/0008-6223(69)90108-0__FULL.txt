Gradual build-up of pyrolytic carbon on the surface of contact material caused a continuous decrease with time in the porosity and surface area of the support (Fig.
The data of Table 1 show that the yield of surface carbon generally diminished with decreasing surface area of the support, while the proportion of fine carbon in the total pyrolytic carbon increased.
The yield curves of total, surface, and fine carbon are shown in Fig.
