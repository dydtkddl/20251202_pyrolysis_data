The possible process routes were analysed and broken down into stages from coal reception and storage through pretreatment, gasification, gas conditioning, gas conver- sion and product storage as outlined in Figure I2.
There are several alternatives possible within each stage such as alternative gasification technologies, and the range of alternatives at each stage is shown in Figure 2 which includes the process routes possible from feedstock to product.
Each alternative is referred to as a process step, and a complete list of these process steps is given in Table I.
Each process step has been modelled as a discrete operation that includes mass and energy balances and capital cost estimation as shown in Figure 3.
A process is constructed from a sequence of process steps from the list in Table 1 as shown in Figure 4.

Table 2 shows the results for two gasifiers, Dow and Shell, and two coal types which shows that very good agreement is achieved over a range of processes and feedstocks.

The information used in the gas conditioning steps and gas conversion steps was provided by John Brown Engineers and Constructors Ltd from either in-house data or as supplied by the companies as shown in Table 3.
The recycle gas can be Recycle Syngas compressor Figure 6 Methanol synthesis flowsheet recycled untreated, steam reformed or a PSA unit can be included to purify hydrogen for use in the conversion processes.
Figure 6 shows a flowsheet for the methanoi process and Figure 7 shows the steps used by the program to perform the mass and energy balances from a raw synthesis gas to methanoi product.
Figure 8 shows part of the detailed algorithm that forms the overall model with the relation between the eight sections that make up the complete model for this process step.

Current fuel prices as at September 1990 are shown in Table 7 for some traditional hydrocarbon fuels.
Methanol production cost The results shown in Figure 10 show the effect of increasing the feedstock cost on the methanoi production cost and the relative cost of production for three different feed qualities, based on a throughput of 10000 t per day, using a Shell gasifier.
Methanol production cost using alternative gasifiers Figure 11 shows a comparison of methanoi production costs for several gasifiers using Point of Ayr coal feed.
