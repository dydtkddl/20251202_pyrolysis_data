When precipitated, asphaltenes can take Yen's structure not only by stacking of different molecules, but more simply by folding a single Tchoubar's structure (interestingly, Yen's original figure of his 1972 paper shows such a stacking obtained by folding).
The structure shown in Fig.
The fractions recovered show prac- tically identical chemical properties (Monin and Pelet, 1983)--see Table 1 and Fig.
On the contrary, the same frac- tionation scheme applied to resins results in significant differences between fractions (this work-- see Table 2 and Fig.
This is interpreted as a necessary effect of size reduction: it is easy to see from Fig.
On the contrary, if our views on asphaltenes structure are correct, it is to be expected that the retention effect will introduce a size differentiation only, resulting in a statistical corn- Role of asphaltenes in oil generation and migration 485 Table 1.
The data in Table 1 and Fig.
Asphaltenes from a petroleum and from the corresponding source-rock extract show statistically identical compositions (Fig.
More recently, Behar and Pelet (1985, 1986) showed that kerogen and asphaltenes from the same source-rock yield very similar pyrolysis products, including polycyclic biomarkers distribution (Fig.

For the resins, few results are available; our elemental anal- yses (Fig.
Similarly, Castex (1985) shows parallel changes for asphaltenes, and some values for resins are shown in Fig.

But in that case, the relative contents would differ widely for materials of different origin, as is apparent in Table 3 (from Pelet, 1986).

A particularly useful concept is the representation of a kerogen as an entity whose parts are linked by various bonds, each being characterized by the activation energy necessary for its rupture; such a representation is shown in Fig.
