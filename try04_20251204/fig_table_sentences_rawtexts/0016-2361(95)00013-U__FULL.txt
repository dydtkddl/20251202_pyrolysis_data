< 350) increased when reaction conditions became more severe (temperature and reaction time increased) (Figure 1), so this conversion was a good measure of the processing severity.
The feedstock used in these experiments was heavy, as can be seen in Table 1, and was characterized by a high viscosity and a high percentage of products insoluble in n-hexane ($0.4 wt%).
The reaction conditions and the properties and distribution of the products are detailed in Table 2.
During the course of the reaction, the H content decreased with increasing time, while L and C increased (Table 2).

On the other hand, the existence of a linear correlation between C and L (Figure 1) indicates that the x 0.6 reaction mechanism could be expressed as follows: x 0.4 The condensation of L to give C was disregarded because it is known that coke is produced directly from asphaltenests and L by definition consists of oil lighter than asphaltenes.

The activation energies for these processes were calculated by applying the Arrhenius equation k = A exp( - E./RT) where the symbols have the usual meanings, and plotting In k against 1/RT, Figure 3.

The viscosity decreased sharply with increasing time and temperature (Figure 6), but the decrease is not as fast as would be expected from first-order kinetics.
Reasonable straight lines were obtained (Figure the curvature at 475 could be due to the condensation reactions that yielded a high-viscosity material owing to the increase in coke content.
