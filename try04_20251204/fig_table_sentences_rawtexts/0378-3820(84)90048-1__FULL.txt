Ultimate analyses of the original Yfibari coal and the asphaltene are given in Table 1.
Hydrocracking of asphaltene Hydrocracking samples were prepared by impregnating ZnC12 (5--40 wt.%, usually 10 wt.%; see Table 2), dissolved in methanol, on 5 g of asphaltene which was ground to pass 200 US mesh screen in a manner similar to that re- ported previously [26].
The autoclave was shaken in a horizontal direction, and heated to the reaction temperature (350--440, usually 400; see Table 3) during 1 h and maintained at this temperature for 0--5 h (usually 3 h; see Table 4).
The gaseous products were collected in a gas holder and 296 TABLE 2 Basic structural data of HS and BS-HI obtained with various amounts of ZnC12a Frac- ZnCl: Ultimate analysis tion amount (wt.%, d.a.f.) (wt.%) C H N Hydrogen distribution Ob Har/H Ha/H H3/H HT/H Average tool.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Table 1 shows that the asphaltene from the reductively methylated coal has similar atomic composition to the original coal, although the former material contains slightly fewer carbon and nitrogen atoms and more hydrogen atoms than the parent coal due to the introduction o'f methyl groups.
The product distributions are shown in Fig.
Basic structural data of the HS and BS-HI products, such as ultimate analyses, hydrogen distributions, and average molecular weights, are sum- marized in Table 4.

The result is encouraging, since extension of the reaction time increases the HS yield (Fig.
1) and is accompanied by a lower oxygen content {from O/C in Fig.
