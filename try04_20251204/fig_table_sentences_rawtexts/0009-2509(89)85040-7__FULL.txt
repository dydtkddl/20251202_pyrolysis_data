The temperature gradient predicted by the model, for the cases investigated in Fig.
Larger fluidized-bed heights cause a low temperature which induces a decrease in the conver- sion, as plotted in Fig.
The two-phase model pre- dicts a slow increase in the reactant conversion with bed height and the temperature does not seem to reach high values, as presented by the dotted lines in Fig.
However, due to the lack of information con- cerning the internal catalyst recirculation, in the dis- tributor region especially, the coefficients p are poorly estimated, so the model predictions must be used with caution to investigate the cases of practical interest NOTATION A 13 H cross-sectional area, mass flow rate, kg/s height, m k kinetic constant, kg gas/kg catalyst/s T temperature, K axial coordinate, m p weight fraction, kg/kg Greek letters a volumetric wake fraction /1 ratio of bubble gas flow rate to the total gas flow rate p parameter of the model Subscripts b bubble phase catalyst dense phase distributor external gas the dead region, the quasi-dead region, the intermittently mixed region and the whole grid zone, respectively jet phase minimum fluidization feed cat d DIST ext gas gi, g2, g3, p 3 mf 0 NOTE: The other symbols are described in Table 2.
