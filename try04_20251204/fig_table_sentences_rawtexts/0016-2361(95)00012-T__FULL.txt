The conversions of toluene, benzene and naphthalene are presented in Table 3.
The results in Table 3 indicate that toluene was decomposed much more easily than benzene and naphthalene under the conditions used and the results based on toluene conversion would be unrealistic with respect to the decomposition of the gasifier product tar.
Toluene decomposition products The molar yields of the main decomposition products of toluene detected with dolomite and with SiC are presented in Table 4.
These fractions consisted of typical toluene pyrolysis products" and are listed with their contents in tar in Table 5.
The material and elemental (C, H, O) balances in the experiments presented in Table 4 were satisfactory (error within 3%) for the dolomite and for SiC at 300 kPa COz partial pressure.
Hence it was assumed that decomposition to carbon also took place corresponding to the elemental carbon yield (deposited carbon) presented in Table 4.

C,H8-.7C(s)+4Hz C(s)+H20--*CO+HZ CO+H20-->COZ+Hz C(s)+2Hz0-+C0z+2HZ The high naphthalene conversion with the Finnish dolomite, Table 3, and the low polyaromatic yields observed with the calcined Swedish dolomite, Table 4, indicated that the carbonate rocks decomposed polyaromatics more easily than benzene.

Thus it was the same as in the shorter tests presented in Table 6, which lasted - 2 h.
The effect of the COz partial pressure of the outlet gas on the conversion of toluene to gases with the materials tested is shown in Figure 3.
The carbonated dolomite seemed to enhance the decomposition of toluene, benzene being the main decomposition product, Table 4.
A test with uncalcined Finnish dolomite at a COZ partial pressure of 300 kPa under conditions similar to those shown in Figure 3 did not indicate any difference in activity from that of the carbonated samples at the same COZ pressure.

The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4.
As the COz partial pressure was considerably higher than the equilibrium CaC03 decomposition value, the total hydrocarbon conversion was the same as with the Nz-COz-H20 mixture, Figure 3.
The hydrocarbon product yields were almost identical for both materials under these conditions, Table 7.
The gas yields obtained with these materials are presented in Table 8.
This is also in contrast to the results obtained with the Swedish dolomite with the Nz-HzO-COz mixture, Table 4.
The equilibrium decomposition temperature of CaC03 was 980 under the conditions used if the reactor inlet COz partial pressure (300 kPa) is used as the basis, Figure 2.
