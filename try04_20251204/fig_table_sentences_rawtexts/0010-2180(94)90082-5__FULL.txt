As a result, the particles appeared to be ring-shaped images having a dark core sur- rounded by a luminous thick flame (Fig.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Calorimetry and Adiabatic Flame Temperature The heating values of the polymers were deter- mined by conducting experiments in a bomb calorimeter (Parr Model 1241) and were found to be consistently lower than the values for the corresponding monomers (Table 1), most likely because of the depolymerization energy re- quirement.
Moreover, the calculations were per- formed for two cases: (i) by assuming that there is no substantial dissociation of the com- bustion products, and, (ii) by assuming the existence of dissociation reactions at equilib- rium.6 In the latter case, the following reac- tions were considered: CO2+H2~CO+H20, H20 ~H2 + 1/202 The resulting simultaneous nonlinear equilib- rium relations were solved iteratively with Newton's method and results are given in Table 1, where values in italics correspond to calcula- tions that account for the dissociation reac- tions.
No substantial flame dis- tortion due to convection or buoyancy was observed (Figs.
Results on flame temperature and duration are presented in Table 2.

The pyrometer radiation intensity signals of PVC particles burning in air reached their maximum value at the very beginning of the combustion (Fig.
One at the very beginning of combustion and another a little later (Fig.
Toward the end of the com- bustion, the particle appeared small and glowed dimly (Figs.
3a and 3b), and the temperature was stabilized around 2000 K (Fig.
When residual chars, shown in Fig.
In Fig.
The flame diameter reached a maximum value of 1.5 mm in 1-2 ms, stayed constant for the following 4-5 ms, and then decreased in the remainder of the burntime (Figs.
Corresponding pyrometry intensity traces rose slowly to their maximum values and exhib- ited two mild peaks of comparable intensity (Fig.
The temperature slightly decreased with time from an initial value around 2000 K to 1800 K, (Fig.
The flame stayed constant both in size and intensity during most of the combustion period (Figs.
difference being that the combustion times were a little shorter (5 ms) and the tempera- tures higher (2300 K) (Fig.
During the initial 1-2 ms, the flame size increased rapidly, as shown in Fig.
The pyrometer signals were weak, which is an indication of low sooting flames (Fig.
The volatiles that were released initially, probably of low molecular weight, might have burned in a fuel lean environment, which can explain the relatively low initial temperatures (Table 2).
Ini- tially, the particles appeared small (close to their original size) and dim, indicating that no substantial pyrolysis had yet started, Fig.
The pyrometric inten- sity signals of the large size poly(ethylene) and poly(propylene) particles were also weak and exhibited a long period of extremely low inten- sity, probably corresponding to slow initial py- rolysis (Fig.
Such results are included in Table 3, where it can be seen that the burning rate of PVC, as well as the corresponding burning rate constant, were much higher than those of hy- drocarbon droplets of similar sizes.

CALCULATION OF THE INSTANTANEOUS PARTICLE BURNING RATE To calculate the instantaneous burning rate of the polymer particles an energy balance was performed on a control volume (open system) around the flame envelope (Fig.

Using this analysis, the burning rate of a single particle was calculated at any instant of time during its combustion and plots are dis- played in Figs.
From these cal- culations an integrated average mass buming rate was derived and compared with the ob- served average rate; the latter was calculated by dividing the mass of the particle by the burnout time and is listed in the last column of Table 3.
Best fit values for f,~ for each poly- mer, are shown in Table 4.

seems that pyrolysis and oxidation do not lead to large amounts of condensed products..Also, it can be seen in Fig.
7a that the instantaneous mass burning rate of PVC decreases drastically with time, while that of poly(styrene) mildly decreases (Figs.
8a and 8b), and those of poly(ethylene) and poly(propylene) increase (Figs.
Results are seen in Figs.
Arrhenius plots for PVC are shown in Figs.
Both the instantaneous burning rate, R (in mg/s) and the burning rate normal- ized with the flame thickness, or the char di- ameter (RY, (in mg/s-mm) have been plotted against the inverse of temperature (Figs.
The corresponding activation energies, Ea and E'a, and preexponential factors, A and A', are reported in Table 4.

Good agreement in kinetic parameters was obtained for two sizes of PVC particles, -~ 80 and = 100/xm in diameter, as shown in Table 4.
Furthermore, the same activation energy and preexponential factor were obtained when poly(styrene) particles were burned in different 02 partial pressures, as shown in Table 4.
