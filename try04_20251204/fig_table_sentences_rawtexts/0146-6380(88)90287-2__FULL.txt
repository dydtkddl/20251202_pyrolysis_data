In Table 4, chemical properties and structural parameters of the thermal bitumen, the initial kerogen and shale oil are summarized.
As shown in Table 4, the H/C atomic ratio and the structural parameters provided from the NM R spectroscopy, infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, reveal a striking structural and chemical resemblance between the thermal bitumen and its parent kerogen, but are 1()4?
The kinetic parameters of this depolymerization stage are lower than those of the pyrolysis process, the transition between both process appears to occur around 372-373 (Table 5).
As a result, we propose Table 5.
The results of the depolymerization tests with different kerogen types were summarized in Table 6.
Four samples from Fushun and QIN KUANGZONG Table 6.
The maturity parameters from these biomarkers are listed in Table 7.
Table 8 presents the gross composition in terms of compound classes of the thermal bitumen and the Table 7.
