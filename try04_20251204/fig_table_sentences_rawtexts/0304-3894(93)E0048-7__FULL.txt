This secondary reaction can affect the calcu- lation of both kinetic and thermodynamic constants at 900 O(3~ For this reason, V,,~,, for CO has been extrapolated by means of the dashed curve of Fig.
The material balances at the different temperatures tested are listed in Table 2.
Water forms the major part of the liquid residues reported in this Table.

Model application The pyrolysis yield, expressed as the ratio between the volumes of gas produced at a given time (V,) and that related to the total productions (V~1, J, has been plotted in Fig.

The values of the specific rate constants, calculated under different temper- ature conditions for all the gaseous products, have been listed in Table 3.
Besides the expected general increase of the pyrolysis rate with increasing temperature, the figures of Table 3 confirm the above-mentioned qualitative observations on the relative production rates of the different gases.
In fact, a comparison of the specific rate constants of the different products at 700 C shows that the first chemical bonds to react are those (C Cl) generating 0,0 -0,4 -0,8 -1,2 Time (mm) Fig.

A confirmation of this is provided when comparing the values for all gaseous products listed in Table 4.
From the values listed in Table 4 one can observe that the activation entropy reaches a very high negative value ( 295< ASact, < 271 J/mol K) for each of the reactions under consideration.
