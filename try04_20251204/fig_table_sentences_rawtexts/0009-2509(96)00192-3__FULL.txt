The acidity of catalyst was measured by temperature programmed desorption Pd source _++, Evacuation Fig.1.
Palladium was densely trapped in macropores near the top surface as shown in Fig.2 (a).
Figure 2 (b) indicates a spot 20 ~m from the surface.
Only the a-alumina particles are seen in Fig.2 (c) that shows a spot 50 ~m from the surface.
Figure 3 shows hydrogen and nitrogen permeances after three and four repetitions.
As shown in Fig.4, H2 permeance remained unchanged but N2 permeance was increased when the membrane was exposed to CHaSSCH3 at a mole fraction of 2x10-3.
Figure 5 shows the change in the permeances of hydrogen and nitrogen when COl4 was mixed in nitrogen at a mole fraction of 5×10-4.

Figure 7 shows that the reaction rate of propane decreased with increasing hydrogen mole fraction xm, when xm was higher than the propane mole fraction Xc3.
Figure 8 shows that the reaction rate of propane obeyed the zero-order reaction mechanism for Xca > 0.2, where the adsorption of propane was saturated.
When hydrogen was added in the system, dehydrogenation of propane was suppressed as indicated in Fig.7.
Propane t:onversion and product distribution with and without the hydrogen removal are indicated in Table 1.
