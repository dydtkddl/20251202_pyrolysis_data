Figure 3 shows the effect of reactor temperature and freeboard residence time on cellulose tar yields measured after the installation of the wire-mesh baffle to block particle elutriation from the fluidized bed.
Char yields corresponding to these experimental temperatures are given in Table 2.
While differences between tar yield curves above 400 (Figure 3) can thus be explained in terms of increased gas phase cracking reactions of pyrolysis tars (resulting from longer vapour residence times in the hot freeboard), it is also relevant to determine amounts of tar actually entering the freeboard, from the fluidized bed, at each temperature.
The highest measured value of the tar yield (81 wt %) could provisionally be considered as the Table 3 Parameters from linear regression fits of substrate tar yields against vapour residence time at constant temperature.

Table 3 presents the calculated amounts of tar entering the freeboard at each temperature and the regression coefficients for the straight line fits.
Tar characterization Table 4 shows amounts of laevoglucosan and phenol found in the cellulose flash pyrolysis tars by g.c.-m.s.
Yields of products other than laevoglucosan remain low, with the exception of phenol, the concentration of which increases with temperature above 500 (Table 4).
Table 2 gives the corresponding char yields as a function of temperature.
The amount of condensable volatiles entering the freeboard from the fluidized bed at each temperature was estimated by extrapolating tar yield versus residence time data, at constant temperature, to zero residence time (Table 3).
For silver birch (Figure 4), the maxima in the tar yield curves occur around a mean of425.
Table 5 presents mole fractions of major constituents identified in the silver birch tars as a function of reactor temperature.

Table 3 shows that up to 650, the estimated amounts of tar entering the freeboard from the fluidized bed during Can and Linby pyrolysis are constant within experimental error, in contrast to substantial loss of tar within the bed found with the other substrates.
Gas phase cracking reactivities of tars from Can and Linby are also substantially lower than cellulose, silver birch or MSW tars (Table 6).
Calculation of apparent kinetic parameters The calculation of apparent kinetic parameters (Table 6) for the tar cracking reactions was performed4 by assuming: a, the reactor freeboard behaves as a piston flow reactor; b, that amounts of tar entering the freeboard can be calculated as in Table 3; and c, that all cracked tar molecules yield gaseous products through a set of parallel independent first order reactions with a common frequency factor and a statistical distribution of activation energies6.
In view of the regression coefficient values quoted in Table 3, it is possible to attempt to interpret the data in terms of zero order kinetics.
MSW occupies an intermediate position in the table, possibly because of the distribution of its components, which include paper, wood and various plastic wastes.
Absolute values of the pre-exponential factors and apparent mean activation energies (Table 6) are in all cases lower than values quoted in the literature for C-C and C-0 bond rupture, and for the pyrolysis of the original substrates themselves.

While, therefore, the comparison of calculated values in Table 6 can be used for comparing relative thermal stabilities of the pyrolysis tars, the absolute values of the kinetic parameters can only be considered as approximate.
