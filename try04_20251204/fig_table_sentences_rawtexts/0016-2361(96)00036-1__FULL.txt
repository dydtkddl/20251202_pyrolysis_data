Product separation After the reaction products were cooled to room temperature and the total gas quantified and vented, the products were separated as depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 3B shows the dependence of the reactor residue on the severity of the treatment.
As shown in Figure 4A, the dichloromethane-solubles are low (~,-5 wt%) at low severity, then remain at ~7 wt% at medium to high severity except in one instance in which 10 wt% is obtained.
Total gas production is seen in Figure 4B to increase steadily with increasing severity of treatment.
Table 2 gives the relative abundance of each compound as a function of treatment severity.

Increasing the amount of catalyst threefold in run 12 at the same severity as in run 3 (see Table 1 ) did not significantly affect the distribution and yield of products, except that there was a moderate increase (8 wt%) in the residual lignin precipitated and a lower yield of reactor residue.

The effect of nickel is reflected by the much larger amount of gas produced at a given severity, evident by comparison of the above yields of gas in the two runs with those presented in Figure 4.
As shown in Figure 5, ALCELL lignin is extensively decomposed into smaller fragments during hydrocracking.
Table 3 shows the molecular weights Mw and Mn, and the corresponding polydispersity.
