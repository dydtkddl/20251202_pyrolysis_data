Notwithstanding that possibility, a glance at table 3 shows, for equivalent treatment and Fig.
Reversed U bend and constant deflection tensile tests Results from the reversed U bend tests in steam/ hydrogen at 380°C are given in table 4.
A similar effect, of a relatively long incu bation time for the detection of cracks, was apparent with the heats EPRI 1 and 2, with no cracking for exposure times up to 905 h but quite marked cracking with additional exposure of about 500 h (fig.
Table 4 indicates that ageing at 450°C following straining and heating to 925°C, tends to reduce the incubation time for cracking.
This latter effect is also apparent in the results (table 5) for the constant strain tensile tests on heat 2683.
The tests on heats EPRI 1 and 2 referred to in table 5 show that cracks were detected after 552 h exposure, whereas in the reverse U bend tests (table 4) even 905 h exposure did not produce cracking.
The results are given in table 6 and although the intergranular cracks were short and only found on the inner surface and at the apex of the C ring specimens, the trends in relation to the effects of various treat ments were similar to those for the tests in high tem perature water.

Convincing evidence of the latter was first observed with material given 10% cold work prior to heat treat ment at 925°C, as is apparent from fig.
A similar effect was seen when specimens given the same initial treatment were aged at 450°C for either 60 or 150 h (figs.
5(f) and (g)), though the normalised charge values from the EPR tests were maximal at 60 h (fig.

Typical pairs of microstructures are illustrated in fig.
The as received material had a fine grain size with a lot of intergranular carbide (figs.
A high temperature anneal, at 1100°C, dissolved most of the intergranular carbide (figs.
6(c) and (d)) and caused grain growth whereas a 925 ° C anneal after 10% cold work left some intcrgranular carbide and generated semicontinuous grain boundary carbide (figs.
Subsequent ageing at 450°C for 60 h generated more continuous grain boundary and twin boundary carbides, (figs.
6(g) and (h)), than were observed in unaged material, and similar structures were apparent (figs.

In the present work cracking was not induced in slow strain rate tests at 300°C with an applied potential of 800 mV (SHE) (table 3), yet at the free corrosion potential at 340 and 360°C, involving poten tials in the range 630 to 700 mV (SHE), cracking did occur.
Moreover, intergranular corrosion was ob served upon exposure to a steam/hydrogen environ 129 ment at 380°C (table 4) indicating an inherent sensi tively to dissolution in the grain boundary regions, although if sulphur and/or phosphorus was present in such regions it is possible to speculate that hydrogen discharge and ingress into the grain boundary regions would accompany such attack.
Some of the problems associated with the crack velocity data in table 3 from the slow strain rate tests have already been mentioned, particularly the appar ent reduction in velocity with decreasing strain rate.
However, it appears reasonable to assume that the highest crack velocity at any given temperature will be the most relevant and those are shown for the 2683 material on fig.
7 for 340 and 360°C taken from table 3.
That sug gests that it may be not unreasonable to use data from table 4 for tests at 380°C, despite the differences in the alloy and testing conditions compared to those in volved in table 3.
It was mentioned earlier in relation to table 4 that EPRI 2 material strained and heated to 925°C before water quenching displayed no cracks af ter 905 h exposure but that cracks had penetrated the 130 6 E E r U o 7 w Y U a U U 0 J.

That crack velocity for the EPRI 2 heat is also shown on fig.
If, instead of the upper bound velocities, average values are taken, as also indicated on fig.
It may be argued that it is simply fortuitous that the data for the EPRI 1 and 2 tests from table 4 fit the same line as the da' a from table 3, not least because there are crack velocities quoted in tables 4 and 5 that are appreciably lower for the same or even other heats.
That suggestion is sup ported by the data shown in table 5 for the tests on heat 2683 cold worked, heated to 925°C, quenched and then aged at 450°C, and tested for 552 and 1000 h.
Consequently, the highest observed crack velocity in the context of tables 4 and 5 is that most likely to refer to a continuously propagating crack.
Assuming the validity of the activation energy of 191.4 kJ/mol and of the data shown in fig.
4 and table 6, that 60 h at 450°C after cold working and quenching from 925°C induces maximum susceptibility to crack ing, what are the implications for equivalent develop ment of susceptibility by ageing during stress corrosion tests?
At 380°C, the temperature of the tests to which table 4 refers, it would take about 1800 h to reach a condition equivalent to that imparted in 60 h at 450°C.
Table 4 suggests that number is of the correct order but too high by a factor of about 2, which may be a consequence of the strain imparted to the U bend specimen prior to exposure at 380 ° C.
It may be of significance that the EPRI 1 and 2 heats that gave the high crack velocities shown in table 4 were strained and quenched from 925°C but not subsequently aged.
Alloys that are inherently more susceptible to cracking are associated with a similar activation energy if relevant data avail able from a number of sources [6,7,12] are used in calculating such, even though the time to crack initia tion at a given temperature is almost an order of magnitude less than for the inherently resistant alloys, as is apparent from fig.

Two other possible rate controlling processes are carbon and chromium diffusion, for which activation energies of 138 and 273 k,1/mol respectively are quoted [22,23], but neither of which is particularly close to the values suggested by the upper and lower bounds in fig.
However, a regression analysis on all of the data points on fig.
8 gives an activation energy of 165 kJ/mol, which is obviously approaching that for carbon diffu sion, especially in view of the wide variety of composi tions and thermal histories of the methods involved in the plot of fig.
