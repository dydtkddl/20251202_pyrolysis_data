Dilute and emulsion phase velocities and volume fractions are given in Table 1.
(1) With the volume fraction of jets, 5,,, given in Table 1 we can rearrange (1) and determine explicitly the expanded bed height 1l,(5, &)+Lmj L, l~5B The average bubble fraction in the bed, ~ and there- fore, Lf, can be calculated from an average bubble diameter, d~, where dt=(Lh)I dn,(z*)dzt = h7 yields = dbm + (_dn.o) m- (exp (_o.3(Li h7)) 1).
From the relations set forth above and those contained in Table I it is apparent that one can compute the volume fraction of all phases, their volumes, and the total reactor volume as well as the absolute Velocities of the two gas phases throughout the bed.

Mass and heat cmssflow between phases Mass and heat transfer between the bubbles and the interstitial gas and between the interstitial gas and the particles can be reasonably well described by the rela- tions of Kunii and Levenspiel[17] and Ranz and Marshall [181, respectively, as given in Table 1.
From the literature we have compiled the kinetic data shown in Table 2.
Those approaches have Table 2.

Since the feed gas composition is held constant at forty percent inlet oxygen, the effect of an increase in carbon monoxide production with superficial gas velocity is clearly the result of an increase in the bed temperature, shown to occur in Fig.
In considering the effect of homogeneous kinetics in the jets and bubbles, we can observe, from Fig.
From the curves of Fig.
This is quantified in Fig.

This trend is similar to that previously shown for an increase in superficial gas velocity (Fig.
