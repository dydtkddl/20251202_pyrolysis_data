Results and discussion The various physical properties of the three phases and the kinetic parameters for the reactions used in this study are listed in Table 1.
The operating conditions and reactor configuration listed in Table 2 were used to obtain the results plotted in Figs.
Only one parameter at a time (out of the eight listed in Table 2) was changed while generating the results in Figs.
The values of the variable parameter are shown on each figure, the values of the remaining seven parameters used in each case being the same as those shown in Table 2.
The kinetic parameters (frequency factors and activation energies in Table 1) for reaction (4) were chosen such that the hydrogen consumption was around 3 - 5% of the heavy oil consumption (N.L.
The results are shown in Fig.

The effect of gas velocity on individual yields and consumptions is outlined in Fig.
These two counteracting effects cause the observed maxima in the yield of C and hydrogen consumption, as shown in Fig.
The increased backmixing in the solid phase results in a decrease in catalyst concentration and the catalyst concentration gradient everywhere in the reactor, as shown in Fig.
For the operating conditions which were used to obtain the results shown in Fig.
Both these factors help to improve the yields of B and C, and there is an increase in consumption of hydrogen and A and also total vaporization of liquid as the reactor length is increased, as shown in Fig.
From Fig.
(8) Effect o f particle size An increase in the particle size of the catalyst increases the effect of settling and thus increases the catalyst concentration gradient and the local catalyst concentration everywhere in the reactor, as shown in Fig.
Typical profiles of the dimensionless concentrations of A, B, C and H2, the dimensionless velocities of gas, liquid and slurry, Llg, tJQ and USQ respectively, the hold-ups of the gas, liquid and solid phases, eg, eQ and eg respectively, and catalyst concentration Cg are plotted in Figs.
