There are many important large-scale industrial applications in this area which are concerned with the production of raw materialThe increasing use of heavier petroleum-based fractions for ethylene production, but which aiso leads to larger molecules such as propylene, dienes and aromatics, has resulted in important advances in tire theory and chemistry- of TABLE = a bibliography of -analytical pyrolysis reviews Title 1J_:e \LT.ber Re_eri-^-re o references Identi ica:ioa of o b_nic s--bs:ances by t'^.e GC an_ly-sis of their pvrolvss proc_cs Ic'e.^.tiCCat:~ o_r su!u:ar_ces of low ~-o'.=:i!=:y- by Yy-noly ss -,s caro_natog--=pzi- Tecanic_es a_^_e po:ertir.lizicc of py--o?rss=,-,s chror'-atob phv Prroly-ss 6s chramatoZr aphy Py-roly-ss-gs ch-oz^na:ob zphy-_ _1 bibHognap^y ~ i 96~o~ Py-ro:y i!c ttelhnlques py'rOly-~3~5 c^_O:':13La'~'_^~7^y- ~rt indLLS:r;-i view of prroly-SS ~:S t :r0.^.'__:Ob C `ph y.
