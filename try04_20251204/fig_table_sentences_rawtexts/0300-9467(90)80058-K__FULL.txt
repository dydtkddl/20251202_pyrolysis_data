The results are presented in Table 5.
64 From the results presented in Table 5 we can draw the following conclusions.
Catalytic cracking of oil fraction XIC (Table 1) was carried out on a synthetic silica-alumina catalyst (VIIK) (Table 2) at 475 and 500 C (WHSV of oil fraction feed, 1 6 - 2.8 h-1, catalyst to feed ratio (w/w), 6-1).
Catalytic cracking of oil fraction XC (Table 1) was carried out on active clay microspherical catalyst (VIIIK) (Table 2) at 500 and 550 C (WHSV of oil fraction feed, 1.6 - 3.0 h-1, catalyst to feed ratio (w/w), 6.5:1).
The apparent reaction rate constants obtained are given in Table 5.
The apparent reaction rate constants of catalytic cracking of XIC and XC (mixtures of gas oil with products of conversion) (Table 5) are compared with the apparent reaction rate constants of catalytic cracking of clean vacuum gas oil (Table 3) (similar catalyst and number of stages used).
The influence of the size of the catalyst particles was investigated by cracking oil fraction IXC (Table 1) on active clay microspherical catalyst (VIK) (Table 2).
Bitepaj [43] has established that non-calcinated silica-alumina catalyst which has been subjected to ion exchange with sodium ions is less active as a cracking catalyst Kinetic evaluation of the influence of irreversible deactivation of the catalyst by poisons on the rate of the process was carried out using results obtained from experiments TABLE 6 Apparent reaction rate constants of the catalytic cracking of cumene on the catalytic cracking of cumene on sihcaalumina catalyst with and without poison.
