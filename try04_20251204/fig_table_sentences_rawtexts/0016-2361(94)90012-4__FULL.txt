As an example of the results obtained through curve-fitting, Figure 3 shows the infrared spectrum of an oxidized coal sample between 1850 and 1450cm"1, curve-resolved into nine bands, and its second derivative.
In some cases the second derivative of the spectra showed the presence of a band located at 1705 cm ~1 which can be assigned to aromatic carboxyl groups or 4000 3600 3200 2800 2400 2000 1600 WAVENUMBERS 1200 800 600 Figure 2 FT-i.r.

A proposed reaction scheme is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 8 shows that for each coal the concentration of hydroxyl groups decreases considerably in the first hour of oxidation and then levels off at longer reaction times.
