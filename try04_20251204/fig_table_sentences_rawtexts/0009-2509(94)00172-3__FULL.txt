The solutions for the three FDFs in terms of moments, obtained similarly to that of the two-fragment reaction, are shown in Table 3 for k1 i k2 and for k1 = k2 (with the rate coefficients assumed independent of z).

Knowing the first three moments allows representation of the product FDF as a gamma function, as shown in Fig.
The moment approach affords a good approximation to the exact solution (Table 1), which is restricted to m = O.
