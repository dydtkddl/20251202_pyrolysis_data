CFB reactor model In order to predict the product composition of the MTO process a comprehensive CFB reactor model has been developed, the basic structure of which can be seen from Fig.
The splash zone is located above the bottom zone where a high degree of mixing is assumed due to collisions of downfalling strands and erupting bubbles, Essentially, in the model this zone represents a mixing condition 2A k1 >B+2W A B k2 A/C 1c3 >D/W 3B k4 >2E c k4 >E 3D k4 )4E 2A k5 >3F W Fig.

A schematic diagram of the Berty reactor system (Berty, 1974) is given in Fig 3.
CFB reactor experiments A scheme of the MTO plant is given in Fig.
The cyclone dip legs are connected to a low velocity buffer fluidized bed (diameter 0.1 m, height 0.3 m), which is fluidized by nitrogen using a gas chromatography Fig.

To prevent catalyst from entering the pressure measurement lines while the apparatus is exhaust Table 1.
The results are presented in Table 1.
The temperature dependence of the kinetic constants was tested for Arrhenius law, and the results are shown in Fig.
These reactions include not only forward reactions, as depicted in Fig.
