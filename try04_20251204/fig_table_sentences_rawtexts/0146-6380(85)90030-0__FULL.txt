The regenerated single ion chro- matogram for the m/z = 142 ion from PSOC 155 is shown in Fig.
The total ion current chromatograms for PSOC 155 and 1109 were very similar and show what appears to be a homologous series of doublets through almost the whole range of retention times (see Fig.

The lower chromatogram (Fig.
The ion m/z = 98 is a marker but not a base peak for the other .three classes of compounds, but with the aid of the other chromatograms, the peaks for the dimethyl esters can readily be identified (see Fig.
The yields of the four classes of compounds, derived from integration of the appropriate sets of peaks in the total ion chro- matogram, are shown in Table 4.
For comparison, the principal features of the composition of the extract from two humic coals are summarized in Table 5.
The alkyl naphthalenes and tetralins shown in Table 5 have side chains in the range C~ to C5, and several isomers are present for each carbon number.
It is interesting to note that the long-chain oxygenates shown in Table 5 are estimated in toto to represent 5.4% by weight of coal, while the total yield of alkanes from liquefaction of the same coal is shown in Table 1 to represent 6.2% of the coal.
Also, two other coals of more normal vitrinite content have been found to yield long-chain alkyl aromatics on liquefaction, but little or no fatty acid ester on extraction (Table 5).
