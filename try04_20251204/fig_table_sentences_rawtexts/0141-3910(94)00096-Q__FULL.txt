The dependence of liquid yield on reaction time for a thermolysis experiment maintained at 445, with an initial charge of 120 g LLDPE, is presented in Fig.
The gas chromatogram of liquid produced at 445 is presented in Fig.
Table 2 shows the change in molecular weight and composition of the residue and liquid fractions with time, for an experiment conducted at 425.
The total unsaturation of the products (presented in Table 2) was determined from the ratio between absorption in the olefinic region, from 'HNMR spectra (e.g.

In contrast, the major product from this study was a liquid, with yields up to 82-5% of the initial charge to the reactor (Table 1).
The dependence of the rate of volatile production on reaction time is presented in Fig.
The experimental data are based on the rate of evolution of the liquid fraction, as calculated from Fig.

Figure 6 shows the experimental rate of liquid production as a function of cumulative yield of the products, as calculated from the data presented in Fig.
The values predicted by eqn (1) for the production of total volatiles are also shown in Fig.
The difference between the predicted values and the experimental data in Fig.
Accordingly, the experimental data and the predicted values are in close agreement during the early stages of the reaction (Fig.
However, as the reaction progresses, the average degree of polymerization of the melt decreases (Table 2) and the probability of producing a reaction product smaller than Cs increases.
The above behaviour is reflected in the slow molecular weight reduction of the residue, during the latter stages of the experiment, as shown in Table 2.
Non-condensable gas products Interestingly, the results show that the yield of the gaseous fraction from the thermolysis of polyethylene decreases with increasing reaction temperature (Table 1).
