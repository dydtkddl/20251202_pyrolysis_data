More generally, Nemanich and Solin (116) attributed the D mode to the large DOS around the K point, which arise from the nearby fiat bands, as seen in the calculated phonon dispersion curves of Lespade et al (123) in Fig.

The G mode in glassy C also does not shift, nor does it in the annealed a-C iti Fig: 31(b).
A further factor is that the rate of G peak shift varies with bias voltage for PD a-C:H, as evident in the data of Tamor et al (134), as seen in Fig.
Two types of behaviour are evident in Fig.

Antisymmetric fluctuations tend to localize the initial and final states of an LL transition in different parts of the sample (Fig 71b) symmetric / antisymmetric Fig.
This situation is reversed in a-C :It where the clusters create strong symmetric fluctuations, Fig 71(a).
It is interesting that despite the different origins and length scales of the disorder that a-Si:H and a-C:H should each have rather similar optical absorption edges, each displaying a Tauc region and an exponential (Urbach) tail (Fig.
Datta et al (191) found that the optical edge ofa-C :H also displayed an Urbach focus, They also found a linear variation of E0 with Er, as shown in Fig.

The decay length of the defect states in a-C:I| is expected to be much shorter in a-C:H than in a-C because of the effects of clustering (Fig.

However, it is also clear from Fig.
Firstly, an element from group V dopes crystalline Si because it is forced to enter a 4-fold coordinated site but only uses four of its valence electrons to form bonds to the neighboring silicons, leaving a free electron (Fig.

The data of Reyes-Mena et al (224), Tamor et al (134), Fabisiak et al (228) and Watanabe et al (226) suggest that the spin density N, passes through a maximum as a function of bias voltage for PD a-C:H, as shown in Fig.
The spin density of a-C:H of large band gap deposited at low bias is seen to increase with thermal anneaUing above 300C (224-226), and then to decline above 600C, as shown in Fig.

The gap and the Urbach slope decline with increasing bias, so N, should increase monotonically with bias, rather than pass through a maximum as it does in Fig.
Robertson problem may lie in the multivaluedness of defect and tail state energies (Fig 69), which does not arise for the simpler case of a bond defects, and which would require a more complex analysis than eqns {47,48}.
It was noted earlier in Table 3 that the process parameters for the deposition of high quality a-Si:H from a silane plasma (low RF power, moderate silane pressure, no ion bombardment, moderate substrate temperature) differ considerably from those used to obtain hard a-C:H from a hydrocarbon plasma (high RF power, lower gas pressure, high ion bombardment, low substrate temperature).

The interaction of an incident species with a surface can be defined in terms of r, the reflection coefficient, B the surface reaction probability, s the fraction permanently absorbed (the sticking coefficient) and y the fraction which reacts to form a volatile product (253), Fig.

The sticking and p coefficients of the species can be estimated in terms of their unsatisfied valences using silane plasma species as a guide (Table 14).

These parameters can be calculated for an incident C+ ion for a-C by the TRIM code, as a function of ion energy (272), as shown in Fig.
In contrast, a-C:H films deposited from benzene are very different overall from those depositied from methane or acetylene, as seen in Figs.
The photoemission spectra of IB a-C:H for a stryene precursor (173) give further strong evidence of the difficulty of dissociating some molecules by impact even at moderate ion energies, Fig.

The difference causes the displacement yield to be 20 times greater for sp2 sites than sp3 sites for 100 eV C* ions and about 3 times higher for 1000 eV ions (48), Fig.
If, after displacement, the ions settle back into sp3 and sp2 sites with similar probability, sp3 sites would tend to be dominant, particularly for ion deposition in the range 100-200 eV which is observed Diamond-Like Carbons 313 to be the range which gives the highest density for MSIB a-C according to Ishikawa (47) and Hirovinen et al (45), Fig 65.
They observed that the optimum ion energy for promot- ing sp3 bonding was about 50 eV, closer to that found experimentally by McKenzie et al (40), as seen in Fig.

Their mechanical properties are inferior to those of diamond because of their finite sp2 and H content (Table 1).
The lack of rigidity from graphitic bonding can be confirmed by considering the Youngs modulus of glassy carbon (Table 15).
