In the case of the coal series listed in Table 1, the nitrogen contents plotted as a function of vitrinite reflectance reveal three successive stages (Fig.
In the case of the mixed coal series examined here, the linear correlation between N/C and H/C atomic ratio, for H/C < 0.5 (Fig.

Gas profiles The late and rapid losses of total coal nitrogen and of the pyrolysis yield of N2 is reproduced by the gas profiles from programmed pyrolysis at 30°C/min in Fig.
The figure shows the gas profiles for two selected anthracites: the Escarpelles semi-anthracite from the SBN coal bank, and the WM-SV-M8-CH anthracite from the Appalachian Western Middle field (Levine and Davis, 1989a, b).
The effect of the rank increase on the profile shape of N2 emission during programmed pyrolysis at 30°C/ min of average anthracite samples is shown in Fig.

The figure shows that the Nz gen- eration is associated with the period of deep burial.
The burial history shown by Van Wijhe (1987) for the north of the Broad Fourteens Basin would have given a present-day genesis of deep N2 instead of a levelling off as shown in Fig.
