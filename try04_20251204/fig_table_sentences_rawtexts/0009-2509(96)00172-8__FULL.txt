The development of the MWD (approximated as a GDF with Xo = 125) with time for m = 3 and 5 is shown in Figure 4 for t = 0, 3, and 10 s.

The physical interpretation of Figure 4 is that the MWD is diminished with time because of the loss of tar from the reactor.
In Figure 1 no tar losses from the reactor occur (1< = 0) and the MWD peak continues to rise with time, while also shifting to lower MWs due to tar cracking.
