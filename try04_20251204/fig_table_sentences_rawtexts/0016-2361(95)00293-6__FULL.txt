Sorbents tested Table 2 gives the stratigraphic intervals, chemical composition and Hardgrove grindability indices (HGI) of the sorbents.
The particle size distributions of the sorbents utilized in the full-scale tests are given in Table 3.
The data in Table 3 indi- cate that the amount of material < 75#m produced during grinding varied from 28 to 62 wt%.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sulfation behaviour in the fluidized bed reactor and down-fired combustor Figure 3 gives the Ca/S molar ratios of three size fractions of the 20 sorbents in the laboratory reactors.
In the fluidized bed reactor, the 18 x 35 mesh (500- 1000#m) fractions had higher Ca/S ratios than the Table 3 Particle size distributions (wt%) of the sorbents testeda Sorbent < 200mesh < 100 mesh < 60 mesh < 35 mesh < 20 mesh < 18 mesh < 8 mesh no.

Figure 5 Ca/S molar ratios of bed and fly ashes for various size fractions of selected sorbents in the 30 MW(e) CFBC Figure 4 indicates that the finer size fractions have lower Ca/S molar ratios than the coarser fractions in the seal pot and the fly ash samplesThese data differ from those reported by Lyngfelt and Leckner6, who observed similar Ca/S ratios for bed and fly ash size fractions.
Similar results were obtained for dolostones (Figure 5).
Figure 6 shows SEM photomicrographs of uncalcined and calcined sorbent 2 particles, with calcination occurring on the hot stage of the microscope.
The data in Figure 5 indicate that the difference in the Ca/S molar ratio between the coarser and finer size fractions is less for sorbent 2 than for sorbent 1.

The data are given in Table 4 for two of the high-purity limestones (sorbents 1 and 2) and for a dolostone (sorbent 18).
In light of the fact that both 270 x 400 and < 400 mesh (38-53 and < 38 #m) size fractions had about the same mean residence times in the CFBC, and that the < 400 mesh (< 38 #m) fraction had a higher external surface Figure 7 Sulfur distribution map for a sorbent 1 particle from the fluidized bed reactor Fuel 1996 Volume 75 Number 6 765 Sorbent behaviour in circulating fluidized bed combustors: S.

Figure 10 Sulfur distribution map for a sorbent 17 particle from the fluidized bed reactor area, it is likely that some of the < 400 mesh (< 38 #m) material was produced downstream in the system, probably by attrition of particles in the target region of the cyclone.
For sorbent 1 (Figure 7), the majority of the sulfur was concentrated along well-defined reaction rims (RR) along the particle boundaries.
This is in significant contrast to the sulfur distribution map of the sorbent 2 particle shown in Figure 8.
