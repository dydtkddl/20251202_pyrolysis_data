In structural terms, kerogen until recently was commonly considered a heterogeneous random geopolymer (Fig.
A significant proportion of the lipids, according to this view, survives as free bitumen constituents and gives rise to the group of compounds called geochemical fossils or biological markers (Fig.
Slightly more detailed is the model of Yen (1974) shown in Fig.

Selective chemical degradation techniques deserve a higher rank in the methodological hierarchy of kerogen structure elucidation (Fig.
The type of data obtained has virtually remained unchanged over the last fifteen years as shown in Figs 6(a) and 6(b).
During a recent study of the artificial thermal alteration of a Japanese coal, Takeda and Asakawa (1988) recorded IR spectra at four different heating stages showing the removal or the change in relative abundance of different types of functional groups [Fig.

The resulting saturated hydrocarbons (14%) showed an n-alkane distribution with strong even-over-odd car- bon number predominance and a high abundance of n-alkanes with 37 and 38 carbon atoms [Fig.
In the saturated hydro- carbon fraction of the initial crude oil, the carbon number predominance is much less pronounced, and there is no enhanced concentration of the C37 and C38 n-alkanes [Fig.

PRESERVED BIOPOLYMERS IN KEROGEN--A NEW CONCEPT While there still is the prevailing opinion that kerogen is mainly a random condensation product of various biomonomers which were formed during diagenesis by hydrolysis of biopolymers (Fig.

(1989d) assigned different (relative) "preservation potentials" to various types of biomacromolecules and concluded that kerogen may be a physical mixture mainly of selectively preserved and sometimes partly altered, resistant biomacromolecules (Fig.
