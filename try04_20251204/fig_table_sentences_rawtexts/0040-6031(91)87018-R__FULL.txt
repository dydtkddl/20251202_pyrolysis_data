RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Batch pyrolysis results The results of 12 experiments in the batch pyrolyzer are shown in Table 3.
As can be determined from the replicate runs in Table 3, the char/liquid/gas ratios did not appear to vary with the final holding temperature or the inert gas flow rate beyond a la (95%) confidence limit.
The average composition and yield of gaseous hydrocarbons are shown in Table 4.

How- ever, in many cases, variations in the concentration of individual compo- nents in replicate experiments (Table 7) are as great or greater than the variations observed with changes in the inert gas flow rate or the final temperature.

A striking example is the yield of isobutylene, which ranges from 0.4 to 2.2% of the feed (Table 7).

The char produced (Table 13) has a high carbon and significant metal content.
It is interesting to note the effect of final holding temperature on the carbon to hydrogen ratio in the char; this is shown in Table 14.
The data obtained with the automobile shredder waste material using the DuPont thermal analyzer at heating rates of 5, 10 and 20 C per minute are shown in Fig.

For the experimental data in Fig.
Non-linear least-squares estimates for these parameters when the shredder mixture is assumed to contain from 1 to 4 components that pyrolyze independently are listed in Table 15.
Standard error of the sample weights predicted by the models for 345 data points (115 for each heating rate) obtained from the experimental weight-loss curves shown in Fig.
4 between 200 and 500 C are also shown in the table.
Since errors in digitizing the TGA weight-loss curves are approximately 1 wt.%, the results in Table 15 indicate that even postulating the existence of as many as 4 different groups of compounds that pyrolyze at similar rates as a function of temperature, a 12-parameter model is not capable of reproducing the data within the experimental error.
However, it does not substantially reduce the maximum error when 15 TABLE 15 Comparison ' of kinetic model; i TGA weij ^tit-loss experin aents Number of components Volatiles due to component (wt.% of feed) Kinetic par; ameters Std.
Thus, the simplified first-order models described here are not likely to fit the data below 350 C much better than the four-compounds-with-volatiles model (13 parameters) shown in Table 15.
