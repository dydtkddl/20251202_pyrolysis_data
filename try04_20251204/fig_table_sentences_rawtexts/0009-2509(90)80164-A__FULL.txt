Experiments in autoclaves with s variety of biomass feeds revealed the reaction conditions for HTU (see also Table 1).

As shown in Table 2, no decarboxylation of the carboxylic function on any paraffinic or aromatic molecule not activated by other functional groups occurred under typical NYU conditions.
