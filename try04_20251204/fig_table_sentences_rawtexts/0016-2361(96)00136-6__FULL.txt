Besides the main constituents HZ, HZ0 and methane, the raw coke-oven gas contains higher hydrocarbons such as benzene and naphthalene (Table Z)lm3 typically 0.1 kgme3 of gas (at s.t.p.).

Depending on reaction conditions and the aromatic hydrocarbon used, a solid carbonaceous residue (soot) is formed in the hot reaction zone in the middle of the quartz tube (Figure I).
At the end of each experiment, the soot is burnt by a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen; the amount of soot (and thus the yield obtained during the pyrolysis of the hydrocarbon) is calculated by Table 2 Reaction conditions of experiments planimetry from the gas analysis (CO, CO2) and the total volume rate of the off-gas.
The experimental conditions are listed in Table 2.

The kinetic data are summarized in Table 3.
Hydrogen inhibits the conversion or benzene and naphthalene (negative reaction order, Table 3).
This is the result of the inhibition of soot formation by HZ, shown in Figure 3 for naphthalene as an example.
Products and reaction paths of naphthalene conversion The main product of naphthalene pyrolysis is soot (Figure 4).
Major organic cracking products of naphthalene conversion are benzene, methane and C2 hydrocarbons (mainly ethene) (Figure 5).
Other cracking products such as indene, indane, dihydronaphthalene and toluene are formed to only a very limited extent (Figure 6).
Temperatures of at least 1100 are needed to form CO (besides HZ, not shown) by gasification of soot and the reaction of H20 with the organic cracking Table 3 Kinetic data of thermal conversion of naphthalene, toluene and benzenea Hydrocarbon Pre-exponential factor Naphthalene 1.7 x lOI m3 molVs- Toluene 3.3 x 10m5 mol s- Benzene 2.0 x 1016 molm-O.s-l Activation energy (KJmol- 350 247 443 Hydrocarbon 1.6 lb 1.3 Reaction order Hydrogen -0.5 0.5 -0.4 Steam 0 Ob 0.2 a Range of reaction conditions: see Table 2 b Assumption of first-order reaction with respect to toluene and zero-order reaction with respect to steam Fuel 1996 Volume 75 Number 12 1443 Thermal reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons: A.

First, soot was generated by pyrolysis of naphthalene (and also toluene) at a temperature of 1150 in a reactor similar to the one shown in Figure 1.
Figure 8 confirms that the agreement between measured and calculated values of kG is quite satisfactory.

Products and reaction paths of benzene conversion In comparison with naphthalene, much less soot is formed by benzene pyrolysis (Figure 9).
Major organic cracking products are methane and ethene (Figure 20).
For the reaction of soot and the organic cracking products with HZ0 to CO (and HZ, not shown), temperatures of > 1200 are necessary (Figure 9).
With increasing temperature and residence time, the (under reaction conditions still gaseous) condensed products are increasingly converted in consecutive reactions to a solid carbonaceous residue (soot) (Figure II).
Products and reaction paths of toluene conversion The primary reaction of toluene is the reaction with H2 to methane and benzene (Figure 12).
