Careful examination of the set of kinetic equations listed in Table 2 shows that the difficulty arises from the coupling of the radical equations through the propagation term [first term of eq.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION (1) Molecular weight and polydispersity profiles The influence of the process variables on the charac- teristics of the product can be understood from the number average molecular weight and polydispersity profiles (Figs 2,4,6,8 and 10) calculated by the method of the moments.
These calculations were done simul- taneously with the simulation of the reactor behaviour (Figs 1,3, 5, 7 and 9).

The molecular weight profiles obtained for different solvent fractions clearly show the existence of two competing effects (Fig.
