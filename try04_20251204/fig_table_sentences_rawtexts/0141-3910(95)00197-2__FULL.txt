These free radicals react with one another to form the three-dimensional network put forward in Fig.

A structure including a crosslinking point with a cyclopentene is envisaged by certain authors,2-3-19 whilst others imagine a crosslinking node formed by a direct bond of norborene terminations, or by norborene termination links that have reacted with cyclopentadiene to form polycyclical structures.7-^-2"-21 These structures are represented in Fig.

These oxidation phenomena may become preponderant, and we know that one of the major problems encountered in thermal ageing stability of polyimide materials concerns thermo- oxidative degradation and fissuring.8 9 3.7.3 Degradation products The analyses by GC/MS, by electronic impact and positive chemical ionization of the products recovered during thermal degradation of the specimen materials, under air and under nitrogen, are listed in Tables 1-4.
Thermal degradation of bismaleimide 313 Table 1.
In the case of the BMO crosslink, the main substances formed are aniline and phenyl isocyanate, which occur in the first phases of degradation, whether under air (Table 1) or under nitrogen (Table 3).
The main products of degradation are aniline and phenyl isocyanate, from 500 onwards under air (Table 2) and under nitrogen (Table 4).

The formation of degradation products con- taining isocyanate units is explained by aspar- timide cycle ruptures and recombination mecha- nisms which are detailed in Fig.
