Figure 1, in which char reactivity r'c is plotted vs the steam pressure, shows that this law is also valid in the pressure range between 1 and 70 bar using a char prepared from a bituminous coal at low temperatures^].

Several gasification reactions are given as a simplified model in Table 2, where the reactions of volatiles from coal and of so-called reactive carbon formed during pyrolysis are fast and are in parallel with the slow reaction of the usually non-reactive carbon from char [14].
Figure 6 results from a model calculation in which eqns (15) and (16) are compared, and indicates that for both equations r'c first decreases with increasing carbon conversion.
For comparison the reactivity r'c of coal with hydrogen at 900°C[13] at pressures of 30-70 bar is shown in Fig.
Afterwards we observe the decrease of reac- tivity expected from eqn (16) and Fig.
Figure 7 shows that the reactivity increases with increasing hydrogen pressure, this behaviour being described by a Langmuir-Hinschelwood expression[15]: (17) Hüttinger and Schleicher [16] investigated the catalytic- ally promoted hydrogénation reaction of coke and coal with Fe, Ni and Co catalysts and showed that (dXcldt} remains constant in a carbon conversion range below 0.5.
This indicates that it is the concentration of catalytic sites which is responsible for the reactivity, rather than Table 2.

Table 3 shows that the mean reactivity of coals and chars in hydrogen-steam mixtures is lower than in pure steam [9], the effect increasing with decreasing volatile content in the coal or char.
High rates of heating of coal cause a decrease in the proportion of reactive carbon because of conversion of reactive carbon into unreactive carbon (reaction lib in Table 2) is faster than the hydrogasification of the reactive carbon (reaction lia).
