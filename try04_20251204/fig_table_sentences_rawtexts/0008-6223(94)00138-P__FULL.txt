The average diameter of the fibers was 1.5-2.5 fun and a typical SEM photograph of the as-grown VGCF is shown in Fig.
To study the effect of thickening on the average fi- ber length, some experiments were done without thick- ening and the results, shown in Table 1, confirm that there was no significant change in the average fiber length due to thickening.

The effect of temperature on / is also shown in Figs.
For an inlet benzene concentration CBo of 13.2 mol%, 7 increased with temperature in the range 1283-1353 K, whereas for a CBo of 18.6 mot%, /increased with temperature from 1283-1333 K, but there was no significant increase in /from 1333-1353 K (Fig.
At a CBo of 13.2 mol% and lengthening temperature of 1343 K, /'for a length- ening duration of 25 minutes was 1.7 mm, whereas for CBo of 18.6 mol%, lengthening at 1318 K, 7 was 2.7 mm after 45 minutes, thus confirming the trends shown in Figs.
Comparing Figs.
The rate of fiber lengthening dur- ing the initial linear growth period was calculated and is shown in Table 2.

The calculated parameter values are shown in Table 3, whereas the /calculated using the model are shown in Figs.
As can be seen from Figs.
As shown in Table 3, for both the benzene concentrations studied, kp[M] shows an increasing trend with temperature.
For the calculated parameter values (Table 3), M increased by a factor of 1.4-2 when the benzene concentration was increased by a factor of 1.4.
As shown in Table 3, for both the benzene concentrations studied, kp[M] shows an increasing trend with temperature.
