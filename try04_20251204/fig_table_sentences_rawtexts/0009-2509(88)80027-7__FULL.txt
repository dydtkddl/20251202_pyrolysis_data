Figure 6, at 700 C with no hydrogen, shows the addition of naphthalene and benzene radicals as well as the breaking of substituents from the benzene rings.
Thus, benzene class radicals are undergoing addition to the naphthalenes (reactions 23 and 30 in Table 2).
Figure 7 shows the result of adding hydrogen at 700 C to the same initial mixture as was used to generate Fig.
In both Figs 8 and 9 the paraffin concentra- tion and average number of carbons do not change significantly.
In the presence of light hydrocarbons only, as in Figs 3 5, cracking reactions were important for paraffins.

Figure 9 shows the result of adding hydrogen at 700 C to the same initial hydrocarbon mixture as was shown in Fig.
In order to test the sensitivity of the model to the value of KEQ, the simulation shown in Fig.
Figure 10 shows that the value of this parameter does not affect the shape of the concentration profiles.
