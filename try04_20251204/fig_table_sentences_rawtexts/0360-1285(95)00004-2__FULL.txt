As shown in Table 1 and noted previously by Beyler, for a range of fuels, the yields of CO for rich burning are nearly constant at 0.2 g CO/g fuel burned, while the observed concentrations depend strongly on fuel.
Some interesting conclusions concerning fuel effects can be drawn from the results in Table 1.

In a later publication, Beyler reported similar hood measurements for three solid fuels: polyethylene, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and ponderosa pine." The results of these experiments have been included in Table 1.
In an investigation concerned primarily with entrainment into a buoyancy-driven fire plume, Cetegenz 1 at the California Institute of Technology used a hood system which was a significant modification of the hood design employed by Beyler." Figure 4 shows a schematic for the experiment.
