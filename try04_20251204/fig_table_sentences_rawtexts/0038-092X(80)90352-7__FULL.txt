The use of concentrating collectors appears attrac- tive in the industrial sector because such collectors can heat a working fluid to temperatures as high as 300 at relatively high thermal efficiency, as dis- cussed in section 2.6 and demonstrated in Fig.
Figure 1 shows a breakdown of process heat needs as a func- tion of temperature.
Concentrating collectors can also be used for decentralized, small-scale electric power gener- ation [9] because efficient power generation with a Rankine, Stirling, or Brayton cycle requires that a work- Distribution Including Distribution by Terminal Temperatures Fig.
Figure 2 shows schematically the three types of concentrating collectors that are commercially avail- able or are under active development: stationary and seasonally adjusted; line concentrators; and point concentrators.

The broadening of the apparent solar disk can result in optical spillover with a receiver designed for the ideal solar disk diameter of 0.52 Figure 11 shows the computed influence of circumsolar radiation on the selection of a linear receiver for a parabolic trough collector.
The calculations are the result of a ray-trace analysis combined with a receiver thermal model, both apply to the geometry shown in Fig.
Figure 8 indicates that a linear receiver optimized at a radius of 2.1 cm for 0 per cent circumsolar would cause a minimal drop in performance at 10 per cent circumsolar compared to an optimum radius at 10 per cent circumsolar.

The energy storage capacities per unit volume of selected liquids for sensible heat storage are shown approxi- mately in Fig.

Figure 13 shows the storage media capacity costs in 1978 dol- lars per unit energy stored for large quantities of the same liquids.
However, above 100, the storage tank must be able to contain water at its vapor pres- sure, and the storage tank cost, which is not included in Fig.
Organic oils, molten salts, and liquid metals circumvent the vapor pressure problems, but limita- tions in handling, containment, storage capacities, cost, and useful temperature range are evident for each as shown in Table 4 [48-50].

larger amounts of solids are needed than are water since the heat storage density of solids is usually less than water as shown approximately in Fig.
The cost of the storage media per unit energy stored, although not as low as for water, is still acceptable for rocks as shown in Fig.
Direct contact between the solid storage media and a heat transfer fluid is vital to minimize the cost of heat exchange in a solid storage medium, and the storage volume must be increased beyond that of Fig.

Table 5 presents a few of the possible reactions considered suitable for thermochemical energy storage of thermal energy in the temperature range covered here [53-55].
The heats of reaction are calculated at 25 from standard tables [56].
The "turning temperature" T* in Table 5 is defined as the temperature at which the equilibrium constant is one and is approximated by the ratio of the stan- dard enthalpy change to the standard entropy change for the reaction 1-54]: An<D T* - (3-5) AS At this temperature, the reactants and products will be present in approximately equal quantities for a pressure of one atmosphere with the actual concen- trations determined by the stoichiometry of the reac- tion.

Gas-solid reactions are also desirable since they offer high energy storage densities, ready product sep- aration, a wide range of temperatures, and low cost; but they are complicated by the problems of heat and mass transfer in a solid 3.3.2 Chemical heat pump storage Figure 18 illustrates the chemical heat pump mode of operation in which a dilute sulfuric acid solution is concentrated by using solar energy to evaporate water.

Table 6 presents a number of reactions thought to be suitable for chemical heat pumping [53, 59-61].
The reactions of Table 5 could be used in a chemical heat pump mode to re- cover the heat of condensation given off when the vapor is condensed, and the distinction between the modes is quite arbitrary.
Some of the gaseous compo- nents in Table 6 such as ammonia are not readily liquified near atmospheric pressures and ambient temperature.
