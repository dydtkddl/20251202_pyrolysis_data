RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Sulfur yields and thermal diffusivities Figure 1 shows the experimental and predicted total sulfur yields, defined as the molar ratio of the total sulfur released in the gas to that in the original coal, from the two lignites at a heating rate of ll00Ks-1 to a final temperature of 900 for mean particle sizes of 353, 894 and 1788#m.
The best least-squares fit to the experimental points for the three particle sizes at 900 was obtained for a thermal diffusivity value of 0.3 x 10-7m2s-1 for lignite B (Figure la) and 0.1 x 10-7m2s-1 for lignite A (Figure lb).

,1.0 The model predictions and the experimental data in Figure la show that for the smallest particles (353 #m), a significant fraction of the final pyrolysis yield (up to 50%) occurs during the heating phase (up to ,-~ 0.9 s) and that the process is kinetically controlled, since no internal temperature gradients were predicted for this size of particle.
Figure 2 shows the experimentally determined total sulfur yields for final temperatures between 800 and 1000 using 894#m particles (lignite B).
Predictions were made using previously measured data on the percentage distribution of organic sulfur compounds as shown in Table 2.
Figure 3 shows the predicted versus experimental yields for these compounds for all the particle sizes and final temperatures investigated (800-1000).
Transition from reaction-controlled to heat-transfer- controlled pyrolysis As previously stated, the rate of internal heat transfer is an important factor in controlling sulfur release rates from larger coal particles as used in many Table 2 Product distribution for lignites A and B (mol% S) Temperature () 800 900 1000 Lignite A B A B A B H2S 80.8 85.1 81.5 80.1 82.2 75.1 COS 10.8 5.9 11.0 4.3 11.2 2.7 CS2 3.4 3.9 2.5 10.1 1.6 16.3 Thiophenic 5.0 5.1 5.0 5.5 5.0 5.9 coal combustion and gasification processes.

Figure 5 shows the magnitude of the predicted variation in the temperature difference with time for increasing values of thermal diffusivity.

The transition limits determined on this basis are plotted in Figure 6 as a function of particle size and the pyrolysis rate constant, k (the value corresponding to the maximum temperature reached in the non-isothermal process), for several values of thermal diffusivity cover- ing the range reported by Badzioch et al.22.
The transition limits shown in Figure 6 are in many instances much higher than those reported elsewhere.
From Figure 6, the limit proposed by these authors would correspond to a value of thermal diffusivity of ~ 1.0 l0-7 m2 s-1.
