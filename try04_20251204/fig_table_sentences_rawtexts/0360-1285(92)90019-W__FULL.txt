A critically important zone for propellants and explosives is the heterogeneous reaction region that connects the condensed phase to the gas phase (Fig.

Recently, it has been found that the burn rate of various energetic materials calculated from the kinetics constants measured with Simultaneous MAss and Temperature CHange (SMATCH)/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)2 at 15psi closely matches the experimental linear burn rate measured at or extrapolated to the same conditions.3-5 Some comparisons are given in Table I and the exper- imental details are described later in Section 3.
The important point is that this connection provides confi- TABLE !.

Further discussion of the role of n is given elsewhere.4 The kinetics constants for the polymer compounds are summarized in Table 2.
As shown in Table 1, there is a good correlation between the measured (or extrapolated) values of from combustion and those calculated from SMATCH/FTIR kinetics.
However, the close match of the data from the two types of experiments in Table 1 implies that the condensed phase experi- ences similar conditions and that the chemical pro- cesses are likely to be closely related in the two experiments, The chemistry of the reaction zone is inferred from the final portion of the SMATCH/FTIR experiment, which is the simultaneous analysis of evolved gases by rapid-scan FTIR spectroscopy.

The relationship is shown in Fig.
The leveling off at the higher percent values is attribu- table to dilution of the HONO by other gases.
Quali- tative insight into the processes by which HONO is formed from the condensed phase is contained in the pattern of Fig.

In keeping with this notion, steric crowding of H and NO: groups in a molecule enhances the initial HONe concentration.'It is interesting to note that when the H/NO2 ratio is calculated using only the H atoms from secondary carbon atoms (-CH2-), the FIG.

Their reaction strongly influences the burn rate.69 The gas product ratios ascertained from fast ther- molysis experiments are a guide to the choice of reactants in a flame model of a propellant that incor- porates detailed chemistry.86 While it would be unre- alistic to expect that there is a perfect match between the gas products from fast thermolysis and those in the preparation zone of Fig.
In this way the endothermic and exothermic events of the condensed phase can also be tracked simultaneously with detec- tion of the gas products.7 Figure 14 shows a block Chemical composition and combustion characteristics 107 C C 0 0 "~ ~ 4,,) 4J .4 O} (~ 0 EL 0 Q_ E b3 E 0 "~ 0 O 0J ~ 4-> ~ 4J 23 4o .~ -'~ O E O N ~ rY %_ O 100 - 80- 60- 40- 20- + %N20 a %NO v %N02 x %HN03 %C02 O --, 95 204.2 213.8 -- - i ilI i 221.7 Amine Gas Phase Basicity (Kcallmol) I I I II I II 1 AN MAN EAN PAN DMAN THAN DEAN TREAN BAN FIG.

Figure 12 suggests that their formation is not necessarily coupled or at least that the evolution of CH20 and HCN are retarded relative to N20 and NO2.
Figure 23 shows that the N20 channel is favored at lower temperature while the NOe channel is favored at higher tempera- ture (reaction (16)).
