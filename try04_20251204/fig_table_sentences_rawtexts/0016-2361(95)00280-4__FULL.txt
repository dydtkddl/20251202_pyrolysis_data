EXPERIMENTAL Drying, devolatilization and combustion of single particles of wet sludge The determination of the drying, devolatilization and combustion times as well as the distribution of the sludge carbon between the volatiles and char was undertaken during the combustion of single particles in a laboratory fluidized bed combustor (LFBC, Figure 1).
Continuous sludge combustion The analysis of char carbon concentration in the bed as well as the determination of the location of the release and combustion of the volatiles were carried out in a semi-pilot-scale combustor (FBC-100, Figure 2) under steady-state combustion conditions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Drying, devolatilization and combustion of a single particle of wet sludge Figure 3 shows an example of the results obtained.
The emission and temperature profiles shown in Figure 3 suggest that the particle dries, devolatilizes and burns according to a shrinking-core particle model.

The dry sludge particles were obtained from the same wet sludge sample (sludge E in Table 1 ), dried at 100 for 24h.
The analysis of the bituminous coal is given in Table 1.
In order to investigate the influence of the sludge type and devolatilization tem- perature on the distribution of sludge carbon between the volatiles and the char, data obtained from different authors7'13on sludge pyrolysis are plotted in Figure 4 together with the results from the present work.

As shown in Figure 5, the char carbon concentration (based on unit volume of the bed suspension) decreased from 150 to 50 g m-3 as the oxygen concentration in the flue gas increased from ~2 to 12 vol.% (dry basis).
In order to rank sludge relative to coal, the measured char carbon concentrations were compared with those obtained for various coals (Table 2).
Figure 6 shows the axial profiles of CxHy as a function of exit oxygen concentration in the flue gas, the bed temperature and the expanded bed height.
From Figure 6, it is obvious that increasing the bed height not only shifts the location of the peak of the CxHy emission but also causes the emission curves to rise at a greater distance from the gas distributor.
Although the measured CxHy values represent not the actual quantities of CxHy released but the net result of Table 2 Comparison of char carbon concentrations in fluidized bed for sewage sludge (this work) and coals etc.
As shown in Figure 7, basically three extreme cases may be considered, namely instantaneous release of the volatiles at the feed point with subsequent combustion in the bed (model 1), total release of the volatiles from the particles floating on the bed surface with subsequent combustion in the freeboard (model 2) and uniform release of the volatiles in the bed 1,t ~1200t ,..: 8001 400- = .- 0t 2500- 000- 1500- ~ ,1000.

A comparison of the hypothetical curves (Figure 7) with the actual profiles shown in Figure 6 indicates that the release and combustion of the volatiles appear to be described best by model 3b.
