The resulting ranges of compositions and calorific values are given in Table 1.
Further experiments were carried out on a homogenized sub-sample, of which the analysis is also shown in Table 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Feedstock composition The average values of the range of analyses data, as shown in Table 1, resemble those given by the South Australian Department of Mines, so the sample can be considered representative.
The ash contains relatively large amounts of sodium and a remarkably small amount of aluminium in relation to the high silicon content (Table 2).
Fleissner dewatering Fleissner dewatering is effected by a "pressure cooker" treatment of coal, which loosens the inherent water and allows the water to be removed 166 TABLE 2 Ash composition and removal (oxidizing) Feed Washed Water HTU product Water Water Acetic acid Total HTU product Char of HTU + 10% + 10% followed by HTU washed product after acetic NH3 water + product with water extraction of acid 10% NH3 liquid Ash (wt%) on dry basis 11.3 4.5 4.6 5.2 3.5 wt% of the ash SiO2 39.5 3.2 5.4 1.8 2.5 Na20 31.0 27.8 26.5 36.7 19.2 MgO 10.5 19.2 19.7 17.7 19.0 CaO 6.6 15.0 15.8 12.6 15.3 A1203 6.4 7.9 8.3 7.4 7.6 Fe203 4.9 5.2 8.6 7.4 7.4 K20 0.7 <1.8 <1.8 <1.8 <1.8 TiO2 0.4 0.07 0.07 0.07 0.07 9.4 4.3 41.3 8.2 8.1 5.4 12.7 25.1 8.5 17.1 7.9 10.6 4.9 11.4 <1.8 <0.5 0.12 0.10 9.5 27.8 8.6 14.2 9.5 9.8 5.6 <0.5 0.10 FLEISSNER HTU DRAINAGE 350 250 SAT STEAM SAT STEAM = GAS 12 (SEE TABLE 3) 0 i:i:i: %'~ CHAR 66 " i!!

As shown in Fig.
Via HTU a black coal product with a gross calorific value of 30 MJ/kg was obtained (Table 1).
The composition of the evolved gas is shown in Table 3.
These liquid hydro- carbons have a higher H/C ratio and a less unsaturated molecular structure than the liquid products obtained via ambient carbonization of Wakefield browncoal (Table 4).
Unlike what was experienced with most other browncoal tested in previous work, a significant fraction of the ash was removed (Table 2).
The removal of Si affects the ash melting behaviour (Table 5), the effects of which will be discussed when we deal with gasification.
As a result of washing (Table 2), about the same level in the ash was determined.
Earlier work had revealed that once the sodium is mobile, the removal TABLE 5 Ash fusibility of Wakefield browncoal (reducing) Wakefield Washed with browncoal acetic acid (range of and NH3 in sub-samples) water Initial deformation temperature () Hemisphere temperature () Fluid temperature () 990--1180 1135 1035--1310 1240 >1500 1330 TABLE 6 Removal of contaminants/dilutants via HTU treatment and washings Intake Product Yield/retained Lost/removed (% of intake) (% of intake) wt% as received (= total) Total 100 100 34 H20 55 2.5 1 Dry material 45 97.5 76 wt% on a dry basis Oxygen 22.3 14.1 48 Ash (oxidising) 11.3 9.4 60 Sulphur 4.2 3.2 57 Chlorine 1.3 0.15 9 Sodium 1.16 0.18 19 66 99 24 52 40 43 91 81 C + H 60.0 72.7 92 8 170 is enhanced by the dilution ratio of the wash water to coal, by prolonged residence time for the washing, a pH < 7, a reduction of particle size and agitation [ 5 ].
The chlorine could be rather easily removed so it was probably present as salt (Table 6).
The combined effect of HTU and washing, as summarized in Table 6, is to remove virtually all of the water, chlorine and sodium, and half of the oxygen, sulphur and ash.
Experiments were conducted at different temperatures and the results are shown in Tables 1 and 3.
8 wt% tar by-product is ob- tained (Table 4), which is rich in polynuclear aromatics and phenols.
More- over, in comparison with HTU a larger amount of the C and H ends up as diluted combustible offgas (Table 3), formed water and oxygenated com- pounds.
The results, presented in Table 7, suggest that Wakefield browncoal has a high reactivity, comparable with that of other browncoals.
200 (Table 5) may render the product into an attractive gasification feedstock.
