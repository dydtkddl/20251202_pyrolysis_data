        <p>In reactions with transition-metal centres silanes often behave in a similar fashion to molecular hydrogen, readily undergoing oxidative addition. <br>1<br>However, the chemistry of the alkoxysilyl derivatives is made more complicated and more interesting by the possibility of additional dative O→M donor interactions.<br>Four-membered M᎐Si᎐O᎐MЈ ring systems where silicon forms a σ bond to one metal and interacts with a second metal atom via a dative O→MЈ bond were first established in 1989 <br>2a<br> and are now quite well known. <br>2<br>The nature of the dative interaction may be kinetically labile and is strongly dependent upon the substituents at both the silicon atom and the metal atom, MЈ.<br>The unusual nature of such interactions, together with their possible relevance to catalysis 2c and surface phenomena, 3a particularly in the case of siloxyl ligands such as Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 , 3 has prompted an exploration into the interactions between metal carbonyl clusters and alkoxysilyl ligands.<br>The preparation of trialkoxysilyl-substituted osmium species from labilised clusters, [Os 3 (CO) 12 Ϫ x (NCMe) x ], x = 1 or 2, 4,5 and [{Os 3 (CO) 10 -(NCMe)} 2 (µ-dppe)] (dppe = Ph 2 PCH 2 CH 2 PPh 2 ), <br>6<br> has been reported.<br>Here we describe our efforts to synthesize siloxyl-substituted ruthenium clusters from [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] using thermal and photochemical means.<br>Reagents of the type HSi(OR) 3 , HSiR(OR) 2 and HSiR 2 (OR) were investigated to assess the effects that alterations in both steric and electronic properties of the silane would have upon the derivatives synthesized.<br>All reactions were performed under dry nitrogen using stand-* E-Mail: braunst@chimie.u-strasbg.fr.<br>† Dedicated to Professor A. Müller (University of Bielefeld, Germany) on the occasion of his 60th birthday, with our best wishes.<br>ard Schlenk techniques.<br>Solvents were freshly distilled under nitrogen from the usual drying agents prior to use.<br>Separations were carried out by thin-layer chromatography in air with Kieselgel 60-PF-254 (Merck).<br>Photolysis experiments were carried out in an irradiation vessel using a water-cooled highpressure mercury lamp (180 W, TQ 150 Heraeus).<br>The starting material [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] was prepared according to the literature; 7 HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 , HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 and HSiMe 2 (OEt) from United Chemical Technologies and HBF 4 ؒEt 2 O from Aldrich were used as received.<br>The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 or AM 400 spectrometer; 1 H shifts are reported with respect to δ 0 for SiMe 4 .<br>Infrared spectra were obtained using a Bruker IFS66, a Perkin-Elmer 398 or a FT 1710 spectrophotometer; FAB (fast atom bombardment) mass spectra were resolved using Kratos instruments with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as matrix and laser desorption mass spectra obtained using a LaserTec (time of flight, TOF) instrument and dithranol (anthracene-1,8,9-triol) as matrix.<br>Only very accurate elemental analyses would be useful in characterising the compounds considering the very similar calculated elemental values for 1 and 2, 4 and 5. Unfortunately the samples are very sensitive and after analysis were always seen to be contaminated with [Ru 4 H 4 (CO) 12 ] casting doubt on the accuracy of the obtained elemental percentages.<br>Approximate product yields are given in the text but not reported in the Experimental section due to the reactivity of the products with the silica.<br>Thus, although the relative proportions of clusters displaying high-field signals could be assessed from 1 H NMR spectra of crude reaction mixtures, the yields of isolated clusters following TLC separation were affected by subsequent reactions occurring on the silica surface.<br>In a typical reaction, [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] (126 mg, 0.2 mmol) was suspended in hexane (100 cm 3 ) and heated to reflux to produce an orange solution.<br>The siloxysilane, HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 (0.4 cm 3 , 1.1 mmol) or HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 (0.4 cm 3 , 1.2 mmol), was added and the reflux continued for about 1 h until all the starting cluster had been consumed.<br>The purple solution was concentrated and the products separated by chromatography using hexane as eluent.<br>Reaction with HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 yielded three major products in order of elution; yellow [Ru 3 H(CO) 10 {η 2 -Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 }] 2, yellow [Ru 3 H 2 (CO) 10 {Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 } 2 ] 3 and purple [Ru 3 H(CO) 11 -{η <br>1<br> -Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 }] 1. Reaction with HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 yielded three major products in order of elution; yellow<br>The compound [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] (32 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in hexane (100 cm 3 ) and HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 (0.4 cm 3 , 1.1 mmol) or HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 (0.4 cm 3 , 1.2 mmol) added.<br>The yellow solution was irradiated at room temperature for 4 h and then the solvent removed to leave a brown-purple residue.<br>The products were characterised by 1 H NMR spectroscopy as 1 (5), 2 (80) and 3 (10%).<br>If the same photochemical reaction described above is carried out at 40 ЊC, then compound 7 is formed in more than 90% yield and the remaining material is [Ru 4 H 4 (CO) 12 ].<br>Alternatively, lower yields of 7 can be obtained by addition of HBF 4 ؒEt 2 O (3 drops) to a hexane solution of 1, 2 and 3 prepared from [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] (0.05 mmol) as described above.<br>The solution was stirred at room temperature for 18 h and, after filtering through silica, TLC separation using cyclohexane as eluent yielded yellow trans-[Ru 2 (CO) 8 {Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 } 2 ] 7 (≈ 40% yield), purple 1 (≈ 40% yield) and [Ru 4 H 4 (CO) 12 ] (≈ 20% yield).<br>The compound [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] (32 mg, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in hexane (80 cm 3 ) and HSiMe 2 (OEt) (0.2 cm 3 , 1.5 mmol) added.<br>The solution was irradiated at 25 ЊC for 2 h to yield a yellow solution of 8 in quantitative yield (as observed by IR spectroscopy).<br>Note that removal of the solvent in vacuo causes decomposition and yields of 8 are approximately halved if purification via TLC is carried out.<br>The compound [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] (639 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in hexane (150 cm 3 ) with heating and HSiMe 2 (OEt) (0.4 cm 3 , 2.9 mmol) added.<br>The yellow solution was heated at reflux for 1.5 h.<br>After concentration of the solution and TLC separation, using CH 2 Cl 2 -hexane (1 : 1) as eluent, compound 8 was isolated (≈30% yield) with a blue, unstable compound: 300 MHz 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 , 298 K) δ 3.62 (2 H, q, OCH 2 ), 1.18 (3 H, t, OCH 2 CH 3 ), 0.73 (6 H, s, CH 3 ) and Ϫ16.18 (s, Ru᎐H᎐Ru).<br>Further data could not be obtained due to the unstable nature of the product.<br>Crystals of compound 7 were grown from pentane solutions at 278 K.<br>A crystal was immersed in highly viscous perfluoropolyether to exclude oxygen and prevent solvent loss.<br>It was then mounted on a glass fibre and plunged in a cold (193 K) nitrogen stream.<br>Structure solution and refinement.<br>The structure was solved by the Patterson method and subsequent Fourier-difference syntheses <br>8<br> and refined by full-matrix least squares on the F 2 data using the SHELXL 93 program. <br>9<br>The CO ligands at Ru showed strong disorder with a ring-like electron-density distribution.<br>Their positions were approximated by four C and four O split-atom positions which are multiplied by the three-fold axis parallel to the Ru᎐Ru axis to a total of 12 CO positions.<br>Refinement of the occupation factors led to a Ru : CO ratio of 4.5 : 1, but a change to the idealised value of 4 : 1 gave no significant increase of R values.<br>Thus the occupation factors for the 1 : 4 stoichiometry have been fixed.<br>For all non-H atoms including the disordered CO groups anisotropic thermal parameters could be refined.<br>All hydrogen positions were calculated and isotropic thermal parameters fixed at 1.2 times the U eq values of the corresponding C atoms.<br>Using a weighting scheme w Ϫ1 = σ 2 (F 2 ) ϩ (0.88P) 2 ϩ 0.78P where P = (2F c ϩ F o )/3 final wR 2 = 0.162 (for all data), R = 0.048 (for the observed data) and a goodness of fit = 1.04 were obtained; maximum ∆/σ = 0.001, maximum ∆ρ = 0.45 e Å Ϫ3 .<br>All heavier atoms, even the Ru, show unusually high anisotropic thermal parameters, about four times higher than usual.<br>This behaviour was confirmed by an independent measurement of a second crystal on a different diffractometer (P4, Siemens), which gave almost the same results.<br>CCDC reference number 186/750.<br>Several siloxyl-substituted triruthenium clusters can be isolated from the thermal reaction of [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] with the bulky siloxysilanes HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 and HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 .<br>Loss of one CO ligand from the cluster followed by oxidative addition of a H᎐Si bond generates the purple compounds [Ru 3 H(CO) The close resemblence of the spectroscopic data (Table <br>1<br>) of these two clusters provides strong evidence that they possess analogous structures.<br>A drawing is shown for the proposed molecular structure of compounds 1 and 4 although we are unable to determine the orientation of the silicon ligand.<br>Their purple colour is unusual and of note.<br>The closely related species [Os 3 H(CO) 10 (NCMe)-{η <br>1<br> -Si(OEt) 3 }] has been reported by Adams et al. <br>4,<br>5<br> and structurally characterised by X-ray diffraction: the alkoxysilyl ligand occupies an equatorial site and there is a hydrogen atom bridging an Os᎐Os bond.<br>Also formed in the same reactions are the clusters [Ru 3 H(CO) 10 {η 2 -Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 }] 2 and [Ru 3 H(CO) 10 {η 2 -SiMe-(OSiMe 3 ) 2 }] 5 which are formally related to compounds 1 and 4 by replacement of a CO ligand with a Si᎐O→Ru interaction.<br>These two compounds exhibit similar spectroscopic properties (Table <br>1<br>) and IR data indicate that the structure and compositions of both species are closely related.<br>A high-field resonance, at δ Ϫ14.41 (2) and Ϫ14.42 (5) is observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum of each compound which is characteristic of a hydrogen atom bridging a Ru᎐Ru bond.<br>Mass spectrometric data for compound 2 are consistent with the presence of only ten CO ligands per molecule.<br>To ensure that the cluster attains a saturated electron count of 48 we propose that the Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 or SiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 ligand provides a further two electrons via a Si᎐O→Ru interaction in addition to the one electron provided by the Ru᎐Si σ bond.<br>Although in both cases only a single low-field resonance, assignable to the OSiMe 3 moieties, is observed at room temperature this type of η 2 -bonding interaction has previously been reported for the bimetallic complex [(OC) 3 Fe{µ-Si- A third type of triruthenium cluster [Ru 3 H 2 (CO) 10 -{SiR(OSiMe 3 ) 2 } 2 ], R = OSiMe 3 3 or Me 6, may be isolated from the thermal reaction of [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] with HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 or HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 , respectively.<br>As expected the two species display a similar pattern of carbonyl absorptions in their IR spectra and the 1 H NMR spectrum of each cluster exhibits two hydride resonances split by a small 1 H᎐ 1 H nuclear coupling of 1.5 Hz; δ Ϫ14.94<br>(d) and Ϫ16.50<br>(d) for 3 and Ϫ15.03<br>(d) and Ϫ16.50<br>(d) for 6.<br>The proposed formulae are confirmed by mass spectrometry although the highest molecular ion peak observed for compounds 3 and 6 is M ϩ Ϫ 5CO and M ϩ , respectively (Table <br>1<br>).<br>A closely related compound, [Os 3 H 2 (CO) 10 (SiPh 3 ) 2 ], has been reported with very similar spectroscopic data; 1 H NMR (high-field region) δ Ϫ16.48<br>(d) and Ϫ16.70 (d), J HH = 1.4 Hz.<br>In accord with these observations a structure containing two equatorial η 1 -alkoxysilyl ligands is proposed for compounds 3 and 6. <br>10<br> A 1 H NMR spectrum taken of the reaction mixture of either HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 or HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 with [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] prior to TLC separation indicates that the major product (>75%) is the yellow µ-η 2 -SiO isomer, either 2 or 5, depending on the silane employed.<br>However after TLC separation each reaction yields three clusters in approximately equal quantities.<br>This suggests that chemical or equilibrating reactions occur on the silica.<br>Thus we explored the reaction of cluster 2 with HBF 4 ؒEt 2 O in an attempt to mimic the acidic conditions experienced by the compounds on silica. 11<br>A few drops of HBF 4 ؒEt 2 O were added<br>to a hexane solution of cluster 2 and after 18 h the solution was found to contain a mixture of 1 (≈30), 2 (≈10) and 3 (≈60%).<br>Longer exposure to acidic conditions (3 d) resulted in the formation of trans-[Ru 2 (CO) 8 {Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 } 2 ] 7 (≈10%) and [Ru 4 H 4 (CO) 12 ] (≈ 90%).<br>In contrast addition of silica to a hexane solution of 2 did not produce similar results but a quantitative conversion into 7 after 4 h (Scheme 2).<br>Compound 7 may be synthesized in virtually quantitative yield via the photochemical reaction of HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 with [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] at 40 o C and has been characterised by IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (Table <br>1<br>) and singlecrystal X-ray diffraction.<br>The crystal structure is affected by severe disorder effects (see Experimental section), in the region of the CO ligands.<br>A thermal ellipsoid plot is shown in Fig. <br>1(a)<br>.<br>Selected bond distances and angles are given in Table <br>2<br>.<br>The dinuclear molecules of 7 are centrosymmetric, the linear Si᎐Ru᎐Ru᎐Si array is oriented along the three-fold axis (molecular C3 i symmetry) and the Si(OMe 3 ) 3 groups adopt a staggered arrangement.<br>The Ru᎐Si bonds and unique Ru᎐Ru bond display typical single-bond distances, 2.402(2) and 2.909(1) Å, respectively.<br>Each Ru atom is co-ordinated by four CO ligands which are highly disordered and show large anisotropic displacement parameters despite a low data collection temperature (193 K).<br>From the X-ray experiment alone it is impossible to distinguish between a strong static disorder or high dynamic mobility.<br>The refined split atom model with 12 nearly equidistant CO positions around each Ru atom is consistent with free rotation [Fig.<br>1(b)<br>] and therefore a discussion of the co-ordination geometry around Ru is not warranted.<br>Within the Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 moiety the interior Si᎐O bonds are slightly shorter than the peripheral ones; Si(1)᎐O(1) 1.531 (6)  and Si(2)᎐O(1) 1.611(6) Å.<br>The dumb-bell-like shape of compound 7 causes it to stack in a criss-cross fashion in the solid state (Fig. <br>2<br>) forming a variant of the cubic close packed (c.c.p.) arrangement.<br>The unusually high anisotropic displacement parameters of all atoms suggest a certain additional mobility of the molecules within the lattice.<br>Apparently, the structure approaches the case of plastic crystals.<br>Analogous silyl-substituted dinuclear ruthenium compounds, trans-[Ru 2 (CO) 8 (SiR 3 ) 2 ], have been previously reported, formed in the reaction of [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] with HSiR 3 , R = Me, Et or Pr, <br>12<br> and assumed, by analysis of their IR spectra, to possess the structure displayed by 7. No evidence for trinuclear species was seen although admittedly, harsher reaction conditions (pyrolysis at 85 ЊC in hexane for 114 h) were employed.<br>In an attempt to assess the factors, electronic versus steric, determining the formation of tri-or di-ruthenium compounds we investigated the thermal reaction of [Ru 3 (CO)   structure confirmed for complex 7. Exploring the analogous photochemical reaction we found that at low temperature (273 K) the irradiation products were identical to those obtained in the thermal reaction whilst irradiation at higher temperatures (313 K) resulted in the selective formation of 8 (>90% yield).<br>Compounds 1-6 are formally generated by loss of one or two CO ligands from [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] followed by oxidative addition of a H᎐Si bond to the unsaturated Ru 3 framework.<br>However, alternatively the cluster may fragment into {Ru(CO) 4 } units which react with siloxysilanes to produce reactive mononuclear species capable of recombining to form di-or tri-nuclear compounds.<br>Any remarks concerning the mechanism of these reactions based upon our observations can only be speculative.<br>The siloxysilyl-substituted triruthenium species are stable for large silyl groups, Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 and SiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 , allowing derivatives to be isolated and characterised.<br>Gradual decomposition of the silyl-substituted Ru 3 clusters proceeds to synthesize Ru 2 complexes with the general formula [Ru 2 (CO) 8 -{SiR(ORЈ) 2 } 2 ] and this process can be enhanced by acid or silica.<br>However, in reactions using smaller silanes such as HSiMe 2 (OEt), the trinuclear species, if produced, is short-lived and only dinuclear complexes have been isolated.<br>Thus the size and electronegativity of the silyl moiety clearly has a drastic effect on the ease with which decomposition to the dinuclear species occurs.<br>Large silane ligands and siloxy-substituents at the silicon centre help to stabilise trinuclear species of which the stability follows the trend Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 ≈ SiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 ӷ SiMe 2 (OEt) > SiR 3 , R = Me, Et, Pr or Ph.<br>The reactions of siloxysilanes with [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] are strongly dependent upon the steric and electronic properties of the silyl ligand.<br>The use of bulky silanes such as HSi(OSiMe 3 ) 3 and HSiMe(OSiMe 3 ) 2 has made it possible to isolate siloxysilylsubstituted triruthenium clusters.<br>In the presence of acid or silica these trinuclear species undergo further transformations and decomposition into the dinuclear complexes [Ru 2 (CO) 8 -{SiR(ORЈ) 2 } 2 ].<br>In contrast, only analogous dinuclear species can be isolated from the reaction of [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ] with smaller silanes HSiMe 2 (OEt), HSiR 3 (R = Me, Et, Pr or Ph).<br>Therefore in general siloxysilyl-substituted Ru 3 clusters exhibit greater stability, with respect to dinuclear species, when the siloxyl moiety is large and when the Si atom is substituted by OR rather than R groups.<br>reactivity of siloxyl-substituted derivatives of [Ru 3 (CO) 12 ].<br>Crystal structure of trans-[Ru 2 (CO) 8 {Si(OSiMe 3 ) 3 } 2 ] † Pierre Braunstein,* ,a Jane R.
