Title: Physicochemical synergistic effect of microwave-assisted Co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics by thermal degradation, thermodynamics, numerical simulation, kinetics, and products analysis
Abstract: Understanding the physicochemical synergistic effect of microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis (MACP) of biomass and waste plastics is crucial for efficient conversion and improving the quality of bio-oil. Thermal degradation, thermodynamics, and numerical simulation of co-pyrolysis of the corncob (CC) and polystyrene (PS) were conducted. Results showed that the co-pyrolysis of CC and PS had a positive physical synergistic and compatible effect in reducing energy consumption and accelerating reaction rate. The reaction kinetics analysis and pyrolysis products analysis found that the co-pyrolysis of CC and PS had a positive chemical synergistic effect. The co-pyrolysis both effectively reduced the pyrolysis activation energy and improved the yield and quality of bio-oil. Significantly, the sample of CC/PS (1:2) had the highest yield of bio-oil (52.3 wt%) and the highest relative content of aromatics (95.0 area%) in co-pyrolysis, while 450 °C was the most ideal pyrolysis temperature. This work indicated that the MACP of CC and PS showed a positive physicochemical synergistic effect, and provided theories and approaches for the production of bio-oil from the biomass and waste plastics by MACP.
