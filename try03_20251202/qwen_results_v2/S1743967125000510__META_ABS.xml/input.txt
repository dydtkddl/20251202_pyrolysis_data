Title: A comparative investigation of biomass co-pyrolysis with polymeric wastes using electromagnetic induction heating
Abstract: In this study, co-pyrolysis of biomass and polymeric wastes has been conducted in an electromagnetic induction (EMI)-heated fixed-bed reactor. The biomass feedstocks were water hyacinth (WH) and vegetable waste (VW), whereas the polymeric wastes were scrap tires (ST) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The maximum liquid yield of 67 wt.% was obtained with a WH/LDPE blend ratio of 30:70, at 450 °C for 50 min and with particle sizes ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm. The calorific value (CV) of the obtained co-pyrolysis oil was determined to be 40.38 MJ/kg. The co-pyrolysis-oil was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The findings demonstrated that the oils had superior properties, such as a higher carbon and hydrogen content, and were mainly composed of aliphatic compounds, such as olefins. The addition of polymeric wastes (LDPE and ST) increased liquid yields even though the oils from VW/ST blends had greater amounts of sulfur and nitrogen. The results showed that the wastes in the study could be transformed into liquid products that could be used as alternatives to petroleum fuels in a variety of ways. It has also been proposed that the liquid product might be a good source of a number of useful chemical compounds.
