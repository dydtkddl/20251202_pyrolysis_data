Title: Wax co-cracking synergism of high density polyethylene to alternative fuels
Abstract: Attempts have been made to understand the thermal degradation of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and their combined co-cracking using different ratios of HDPE and petroleum wax under nitrogen atmosphere. We have conducted the experiments using HDPE as the raw material and petroleum wax as co-feed by at 400 and 450°C reaction temperatures. The product distribution was noted along with reaction time of 0.5–3h for the degradation. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) technique was used to measure the weight change of the feedstock as a function of temperature and time. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the degradation temperature. Products were characterized using gas chromatography (GC) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), some other standard physical methods were used to determine the main properties of the liquid products. Results show that the mixed plastic-wax samples could be converted into gases, gasoline, and middle distillate depending upon the composition of feed polymer/wax ratio. It was found that the products mostly consisted of paraffin and olefin compounds, with carbon numbers of C1–C4, C5–C9 and C10–C19 in the case of gases, gasoline and middle distillate respectively.
