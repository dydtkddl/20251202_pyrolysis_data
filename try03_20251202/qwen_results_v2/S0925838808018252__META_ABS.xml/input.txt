Title: The characterization of recycled PMMA
Abstract: The paper presents a study related to the possibility of obtaining polymers through the polymerization of liquid products, consisting mainly on methyl methacrylate (MMA), resulted from thermal degradation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), at 450°C in a laboratory scale installation. PMMA was obtained from MMA chemically recycled without any purification. The PMMA obtained from monomers resulted by thermal degradation of virgin PMMA is clear transparent; while PMMA polymerized from the liquid obtained by depolymerization of 20 years old PMMA (PMMA waste) is opaque due to the presence of impurities, which influence both the polymerization process and the properties of the obtained PMMA. The compressive and flexural strength and Vickers hardness have been determined and closed values have been found for polymers obtained from MMA resulted through depolymerization of virgin PMMA and that from PMMA waste.
