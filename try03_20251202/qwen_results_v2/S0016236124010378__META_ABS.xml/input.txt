Title: Unravelling the structure-performance relationship of zeolite Beta in the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by proposing gasoline factor as the descriptor
Abstract: Plastics are widely used in daily life and industry. However, the natural degradation of waste plastics is very slow, causing considerable environmental problems. Catalytic cracking is able to convert waste plastics into fuels and chemicals, being an efficient and sustainable utilization route for waste plastics. Zeolites are commonly used as catalysts for this process, with the performance mainly affected by diffusion and acidity properties. It is necessary to elucidate the combinatorial effect of these two factors. Herein, zeolite Beta was used as the model catalyst for the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The synergistic effect of diffusion and acidity on the catalytic performance was explored by systematically controlling the Si/Al ratio (SAR) and particle size of zeolite Beta. By correlating the acidity and pore structure of Beta zeolites with the catalytic performance, a gasoline yield descriptor − gasoline factor (GF) was proposed, and GF fitted well with the gasoline yields of LDPE cracking by Beta zeolites, demonstrating that GF may provide theoretical guidance for the optimized design of zeolite catalysts in the LDPE cracking. Through fine analysis of the gasoline composition with M4 multi-dimensional chromatography, for the first time, a high proportion of cyclo-olefins was discovered in the gasoline products of all zeolite catalysts, which was ascribed to the unique long hydrocarbon chains of LDPE. Considering that cyclo-olefin copolymers possess high thermal stability and excellent chemical resistance, the cyclo-olefin monomers produced by the cracking of LDPE exhibit high potential in commercial applications.
