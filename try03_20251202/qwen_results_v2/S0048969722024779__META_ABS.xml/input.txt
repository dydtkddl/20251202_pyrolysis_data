Title: Sustainable valorization of styrofoam and CO2 into syngas
Abstract: Plastic is a versatile material broadly used in a variety of industries. However, the current disposal practices for plastic wastes (incineration/landfilling) add the hazardous materials into the environment. To offer a sustainable valorization platform for plastic waste, this study adopted the catalytic pyrolysis process using CO2 as a co-feedstock. A model plastic waste collected from a seaport was waste buoy (WB), which has been widely used in fishing industry. Prior to the pyrolysis tests, the exact type of plastic in WB and the thermolytic characteristics of WB were examined. Since the WB was made of polystyrene, it was mainly converted into styrene monomer (styrene), dimer (diphenyl-1-butene), and trimer (2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene) from pyrolysis of WB. To further valorize/detoxify styrene derivatives into value-added syngas, catalytic pyrolysis of WB was practiced using the Ni-based catalysts (2/5/10 wt% Ni/SiO2). The yield of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis process of WB was more than one magnitude higher comparing to that from the non-catalytic one. H2 formation also increased as catalyst loading increased. When flow gas was switched from inert gas to CO2, CO gas formation was enhanced due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and styrene derivatives over Ni catalysts. Syngas (H2/CO) formation under the CO2 condition was 5 times higher in comparison to the N2 condition in catalytic pyrolyses of WB with 10 wt% Ni/SiO2. CO2 also effectively suppressed coke deposition on a Ni catalyst. This study proposes a sustainable valorization and disposal platform for used plastic waste and greenhouse gas (CO2), converting them into value-added fuel.
