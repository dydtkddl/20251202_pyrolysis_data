Title: Process intensification on co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate wastes and biomass via microwave energy: Synergetic effect and roles of microwave susceptor
Abstract: The present study employs microwave (MW) energy to enhance the co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes and biomass. Based on the characterization of raw materials as well as gas and liquid products, we propose a pyrolysis mechanism of PET and biomass during microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). The MAP of PET-biomass blends shows a synergetic effect that the interaction between PET and biomass promotes the yields of value-added products (e.g. aromatic acids and phenols) and suppresses the generation of biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to the MAP of individual biomass or plastics. Besides, the blending ratio of PET-biomass has significant effect on the formation of major liquid products. The liquid product from the MAP of PET-biomass 4:1 blends contains above 30 wt.% chain hydrocarbon that can be used as gasoline and kerosene. Moreover, we evaluate the roles of three typical MW absorbing materials during MAP, including carbon powder, ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) and calcium oxide (CaO). Carbon powder can enlarge the yield of main products from plastics pyrolysis due to its significant dielectric loss. Apart from the MW-absorbing ability, Fe3O4 can accelerate the esterification and decarboxylation reaction; CaO can convert acids into ketones and hydrocarbons through neutralization and catalytic cracking reactions.
