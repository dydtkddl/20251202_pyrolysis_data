Title: Evolution mechanism and pyrolysis strategy of ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers for recycling of the end-of-life photovoltaic modules via PCMW2D and 2D-COS analysis
Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising method for delamination and recycling of end-of-life (EoL) photovoltaic (PV) modules. To provide theoretical support for process optimization, the thermal evolution of ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) is focused on. Besides the conventional characterization of TG-MS, Py-GC/MS, and in situ DRIFT, perturbation-correlation moving-window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) analysis were used to understand the effect of physical perturbations and the correlation of the functional group variations, respectively. The results indicate that the pyrolysis of EVA involves the melting stage (60–280 ℃), the first weight loss stage (280–430 ℃), and the second weight loss stage (430–530 ℃). At the melting stage, some acetic acid and its derivatives are generated, followed by the emergence and re-formation of the esters. It suggests the phase separation and surface segregation of the polyvinyl acetate segments. The evolution of functional groups at the first weight loss stage is dominated by the rearrangement while the devolatilization plays a minor role. At the substage of 280–350 ℃, it mainly occurs the transformation of ester groups to acetic acid with the release of some secondary small molecules. The decarboxylation into volatiles is delayed by the H-bonds and concentrated at the substage of 350–430 ℃. The second weight loss stage is dominated by the release of alkenes with ∼77 % weight loss. Consequently, a three-step pyrolysis strategy is proposed for PV modules delamination at ∼280 ℃, acetic acid separation at ∼430 ℃, and alkene production at ∼530 ℃.
