Title: Co-pyrolysis behaviour and synergistic effect of municipal solid waste components on biochar production through microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis
Abstract: This study systematically evaluated the interactive effects of variation of institutional solid waste (ISW) components as foodwaste (FW) (65–80 %): plastic waste (PLW) (5–12 %): paper waste (PW) (10–20 %): yard waste (YW) (1.3–3 %) on microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) of ISW, on biochar yield and higher heating value (HHV) using central composite design. The waste composition of FW (76.6 %): PLW (5.3 %): PW (15.8 %): YW (2.3 %) yielded the highest biochar output (37.9 %) and FW (71.3 %): PLW (11.8 %): PW (14.8 %): YW (2.1 %) yielded greater HHV (26.5 MJ/kg). Biochar yield reduction by cir.32 % and HHV improvement by cir.19 % were observed with PLW increase from 5–12 % in ISW. The ISW composition of FW (72.6 %): PLW (10.1 %): PW (14.8 %): YW (2.5 %) was determined to be optimized condition with biochar yield of 30.9 % and HHV of 25.3 MJ/kg. Such ISW biochar (ISWB) has better characteristics than individual waste biochar. The O/C ratio of ISWB (0.15) was lesser than the corresponding individual waste biochar implying its enhanced thermal stability. ISWB demonstrated a uniform pore size distribution ranging from 1.5–4.0 µm. The XRD peaks at 26.8° and 29.5° signified the (002) plane of CaCO₃ and graphitic carbon structures, and FTIR analysis of ISWB revealed peaks of cellulose, plastics, and other organic matter, reflecting its complex nature. MCP of ISW improved biochar yield and quality, suggesting its potential in fuel replacement, carbon sequestration, and environmental remediation.
