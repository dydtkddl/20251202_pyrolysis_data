Title: Co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride and waste rubber: Interaction mechanism during staged pyrolysis
Abstract: Pyrolysis is a clean and efficient resource recovery pathway of waste polymers. However, the interaction mechanism between typical components is unclear during pyrolysis process. In this work, reciprocal effects of staged co-pyrolysis process of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and waste rubber (WR) were investigated by a fixed-bed reaction device. Results showed that the thermal decomposition was promoted when the temperature was 340 °C, especially at 400 °C. The synergistic effect was enhanced by the increasing of PVC during first stage co-pyrolysis (300 °C). Gas yield decreased by 12.7–72.4 %, mainly due to the adsorption of chlorine (21.9–51.0 %) into char. Tar yields (7.5–9.5 wt%) were improved by 38.5–63.6 %. The content of aliphatic carbon in char (22.88 % PVC) increased by 62.1 %. In addition, the distribution of sulfur in the char was reduced from 86.6 % to 43.1 %. This was mainly due to the free radicals from PVC, which promoted the breaking of C-S in WR and increased hydrogen sulfide. For the second stage of co-pyrolysis (400 °C), the inhibitory effect was similarly enhanced with PVC proportion. Tar yields (37.9–41.4 wt%) were decreased by 0.4–20.1 %. Char yields (28.1–61.5 wt%) increased by 0.4–14.5 %. The aromatic carbon content in char increased from 18.6 % (300 °C) to 70.3 %. This was mainly due to polycondensation and melt-coating of the PVC. Therefore, the co-pyrolysis process of PVC and WR showed a synergistic and then inhibitory change with temperature.
