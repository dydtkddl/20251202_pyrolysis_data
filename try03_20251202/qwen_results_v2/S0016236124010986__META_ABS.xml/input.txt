Title: In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene to co-produce BTX aromatics and H2 by Ni/ZSM-5 in the rotary reactor with solid heat carriers
Abstract: Plastic waste pollution has become a crucial concern in the field of environmental conservation. Catalytic pyrolysis offers an appealing and efficient technology that can convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or valuable chemical products. This provides a practical solution to address the challenges associated with waste management. In this research, an innovative approach of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis was employed in a rotary reactor with solid heat carriers, along with a Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, to simultaneously produce BTX aromatics and hydrogen from polyethylene. Experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. This was achieved by adjusting the metallic nickel loadings on the ZSM-5 support. Next, the effect of Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts and the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio on the selectivity of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil and hydrogen was examined. The results revealed that as the metallic nickel loading increased to 10 wt%, the concentration of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil also increased and reached a maximum of 59.2%. Furthermore, the hydrogen gas fraction in the pyrolysis gas was 58.0 vol% when using the 10Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process. The Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated a significant positive effect in cleaving the H∙ group. By varying the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio from 0.5 to 2, the concentration of monocyclic aromatics in the pyrolysis oil increased from 68.2% to 87.7%. However, the catalyst-to-feed ratio had an insignificant impact on the hydrogen fraction in the pyrolysis gas, with the hydrogen gas fraction ranging from 43.9 vol% to 46.8 vol%. Additionally, this study provided insights into the potential mechanism of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene within the rotary kiln.
