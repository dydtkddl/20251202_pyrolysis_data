Title: Co-pyrolysis of coffee-grounds and waste polystyrene foam: Synergistic effect and product characteristics analysis
Abstract: Coffee-grounds (CFs) are simultaneously pyrolyzed with waste polystyrene foam (PS) in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor according to the following conditions: a temperature of 500 °C selected from the thermogravimetric analyses of CFs and PS, the nitrogen flow rate of about 20–25 L/min., and the feeding rate of 200 g/h. Multiple CFs/PS mixing ratios were treated as follows: 75:25, 50:50, 25:75. The properties, the chemical compositions of the co-pyrolysis oils and the yields of the products were compared with those of the pyrolysis-oils of the individual feedstocks to demonstrate the synergy between the CFs and the PS. The synergy with the co-pyrolysis produced a higher liquid yield than the calculated amount. The higher heating value of co-pyrolysis oils increased to 39.66 MJ/kg, which was equivalent to that of conventional fuels. Blending at least 25% of PS to CFs could greatly reduce the viscosity of CFs pyrolysis oil (from 724.65cP to 29.3cP at 24 °C). Chemical distributions have shown that the synergy effect between CFs and PS has drastically enhanced the production of hydrocarbons, especially in aromatic compounds.
