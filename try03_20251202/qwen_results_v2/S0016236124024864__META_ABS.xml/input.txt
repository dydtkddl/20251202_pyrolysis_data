Title: Aquathermolysis of polyolefin plastic wastes over a MOF-derived TiO2 anatase catalyst: Enhancing C–N bond cleavage and coke suppression
Abstract: Plastics are ubiquitous in modern society owing to their cost-effectiveness, low weight, and durability. However, the disposal and recycling of plastic waste remain significant challenges. Aquathermolysis has emerged as a promising strategy for converting contaminant-rich polyolefin plastic waste into value-added liquid fuels. This study investigates the plastic-waste aquathermolysis potential of a TiO2 catalyst derived from the sacrificial precursor Ti-containing MIL-125 via a MOF-mediated synthesis pathway combined with calcination. The TiO2 catalyst retained its mesoporous properties and predominantly anatase phase on calcination at 450 ℃. The aquathermolysis catalysis and stability of the newly synthesized catalyst for plastic-waste conversion were evaluated and compared with those of other catalytic systems. Additionally, the role of water in the N removal efficiency and coke suppression properties of the catalyst were analyzed. Water significantly improved the removal of N and S impurities, with a N reduction of 80–95% at the optimal water content (20–40 wt%). The robustness of the as-synthesized catalyst was confirmed by deconvoluted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy patterns, which indicated the persistence of the TiO2 phase, even after prolonged catalysis in aqueous environments, and transmission electron microscopy results, which showed that the anatase phase remained well-dispersed under aquathermolysis conditions with a significant reduction in the C/Ti ratio and a corresponding increment in the N/C ratio. The results of this study could guide future research on the development of catalysts, similar to the MIL-125-derived TiO2 catalyst investigated here, with high potential for efficient plastic-waste conversion and impurity removal in aqueous environments.
