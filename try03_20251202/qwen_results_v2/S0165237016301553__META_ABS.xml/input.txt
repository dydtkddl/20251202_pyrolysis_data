Title: Fuel properties of the oils produced from the pyrolysis of commonly-used polymers: Effect of fractionating column
Abstract: The effects of using a packed column as a fractionating system on thermal degradation of commonly-used polymers have been studied. The polymers investigated were virgin polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), as well as two post-consumer polymer mixtures, namely municipal plastic waste (MPW) and scrap tire. The experiments were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a 6L semi-batch stainless steel vessel equipped with the fractionating system. The system led to total elimination of wax formation, color improvement, and reduction in the density of the resultant pyrolysis oils. The oils were analyzed according to ASTM D86, the standard test method for boiling range distribution of petroleum fractions. The obtained values were compared to the Iran standard limits established for diesel (ISIRI4903) and gasoline (ISIRI4904). Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was utilized to determine the chemical composition of the oils. Finally, the spectra of the generated tire and MPW-derived oils were compared with the spectra of conventional fuels, gasoline and diesel.
