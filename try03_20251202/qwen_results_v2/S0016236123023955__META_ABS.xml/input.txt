Title: Aromatization of HDPE and PP over Ga-promoted zeolite: Effects of pretreatment and zeolite type
Abstract: The effects of pretreatment and structure of zeolite on aromatization of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) over different Ga-promoted zeolites (HZSM-5, hierarchical HZSM-5, HY, Hβ, and USY) were investigated. Hydrogen reduction of Ga-promoted HZSM-5 resulted in a higher yield of alkenes during HDPE pyrolysis but did not lead to increased production of total aromatic hydrocarbons. The reduction and subsequent oxidation of Ga/Z5 led to the formation of GaO+ species with high dehydrogenation activity. This resulted in a remarkable 65% yield of aromatics, with a BTEX (benzene, toluene ethylbenzene and xylene) overall yield of 60% and a selectivity of 90% of the liquid product. Increasing the Ga loading decreased the BTEX yield due to pore blockage and a decrease in the amount of Brønsted acid sites. The BTEX yield over Ga-promoted zeolites was found to be strongly related to the pore size of the zeolite, whereas its yield over the parent zeolite was not strongly dependent on the pore size. Diffusion of the cracking intermediates was found to have a more significant impact on the aromatization of PP than HDPE. The highest BTEX yield for HDPE was achieved with Ga-promoted HZSM-5, while Ga-promoted hierarchical HZSM-5 exhibited the highest BTEX yield for PP. Furthermore, Ga(1)/Hβ-Redox demonstrated remarkable selectivity (90%) towards ethylene and propylene in the gas phase, surpassing other zeolites (37%-68%).
