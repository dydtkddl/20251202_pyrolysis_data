Title: A short-cut method for analysis of catalyst performances in pyrolytic reactor
Abstract: It's clear that plastic pyrolysis has become a popular solution for recycling post-consumer plastic, as evidenced by the growing number of research articles and companies exploring the technology. However, the success of the process is heavily reliant on the downstream steps before the pyrolyzed product is fed to steam cracking. To improve the chemical process and maximize the yields of desired products, catalysts may be a viable option. This research paper presents a simple model for analyzing thermal pyrolysis kinetics, followed by a catalytic step. Utilizing high-density polyethylene and two catalysts, we have successfully demonstrated the benefits of our tool. The model enables the identification of the optimal setup, including the ideal temperature, catalyst mass, and residence time, resulting in improved processes and maximum output of the desired products.
