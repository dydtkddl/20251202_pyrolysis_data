Title: Production of C5-C12 olefins by catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene with MCM-41 in CO2/N2
Abstract: The current high volume of plastic waste, but low recycling rate, has led to environmental pollution and wasted energy. Greenhouse gas CO2 can facilitate thermal cracking to dehydrogenate waste plastics, and has potential value for producing olefins. In this work, the pyrolysis properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and Py-GC/MS. The effect of the pyrolysis atmosphere, using N2 or CO2, with various MCM-41 catalyst ratios on pyrolysis product distribution, were investigated. The experimental results show that the olefin selectivity under a N2 atmosphere was from 30.32 % to 44.66 % which increased as the MCM-41 catalyst was increased. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the olefin selectivity reached a maximum of 60.39 %. The Boudouard reaction was also enhanced by the introduction of CO2. The carbon content of the subdivided olefins showed that in CO2, the promotion of C5-C12 olefins was relatively weak when non-catalyzed or at low catalytic ratios, but increased significantly at higher MCM-41 catalyst ratios. With a ratio of LDPE: MCM-41 = 5:4, the CO2 atmosphere showed the greatest promotion of C5-C12 olefins over N2, with an increase of 14.66 % compared to N2, representing a 48.54 % yield of the liquid product. Producing C5-C12 olefins under these conditions maximized energy efficiency. These results show that catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE under a CO2 atmosphere has great potential to produce C5-C12 olefins, which can be used to produce high-value chemicals such as naphtha and gasoline. This opens new opportunities for the chemical recycling of plastic waste.
