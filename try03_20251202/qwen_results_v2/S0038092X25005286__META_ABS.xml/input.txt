Title: Thermostatic pyrolysis decapsulation and pollution control of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels: Kinetic analysis and organics evolution
Abstract: The rapid expansion of photovoltaics is anticipated to result in a substantial accumulation of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaics (c-Si PV) panels that composed of glass, silicon wafers, and backsheets. Given its ultra-thin, highly laminated, multi-layered structures encapsulated with polymers, decapsulation is essential for subsequent component separation and recovery. Pyrolysis has emerged as a promising method for decapsulation, yet current research is limited to thermal decomposition of waste c-Si PV panels during the slow heating pyrolysis process, the kinetic mechanism and organics evolution necessary remain unknown. This study proposed the thermostatic pyrolysis of waste c-Si PV panels, and investigated kinetics analysis and organics evolution for efficient decapsulation and pollution control. Our results indicated that decapsulation efficiency can reach 98 % at 600 °C within 7 min, and conformed to the Avrami-Erofeev model, which predicts decapsulation performance across different scenarios well. The thermostatic pyrolysis process generates acetic acid, hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and fluorine-containing substances, all of which can be converted and utilized for pollution control. Further environmental impact assessments demonstrate its minimized environmental impacts over conventional ones. This work provides a viable pathway for the efficient and environmental-friendly decapsulation of waste c-Si PV panels, thereby promoting the development of waste c-Si PV panels recycling industry.
