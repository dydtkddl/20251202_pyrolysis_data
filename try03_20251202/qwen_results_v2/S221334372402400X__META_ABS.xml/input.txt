Title: Micro-wave induced pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and biodegradation of resulting wax in soil and by defined microbial consortia is closing the loop towards LDPE upcycling
Abstract: Plastic has become essential in daily life, replacing traditional materials like glass and wood due to its flexibility, durability, strength, and cost-effectiveness. However, the global plastic production surged to nearly 400 million tons in 2020, causing significant environmental accumulation. Polyethylene (PE), a ubiquitous polymer, poses recycling challenges due to its stability and widespread use in layered products, contributing to long-term pollution. This study focuses on PE degradation challenges, advocating for integrated chemical and biological treatments. Chemical methods like pyrolysis show promise but aren't fully eco-friendly. Microwave-induced pyrolysis emerges as a viable alternative, offering faster, targeted heating with lower energy consumption. Using microwave-absorbent materials such as silicon carbide, this method efficiently breaks down even challenging low-density PE (LDPE), yielding wax products of 68–91 % yield, with reduced molecular weight suitable for further biological degradation. Biodegradation experiments demonstrated over 95 % degradation by defined microbial consortia and considerable degradation in soil without bioaugmentation. The Rhodococcus consortium showed exceptional potential, degrading 90 % of LDPE-wax as a carbon source within 28 days, particularly strain CHBE-144 achieving 98 % degradation in just 14 days. Genomic analysis revealed enzymes crucial for alkane and plastic breakdown, with strains capable of producing biosurfactants, suggesting up-cycling potential for PE-derived materials into value-added products. Integrating microwave-induced pyrolysis with microbial biodegradation offers a promising pathway for managing PE waste sustainably, potentially reducing environmental impact while creating valuable resources from plastic waste. Further research is warranted to optimize these processes and scale them for practical application in waste management and resource recovery efforts globally.
