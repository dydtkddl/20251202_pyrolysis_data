Title: Production of light olefins and aromatics via catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic
Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of pine and LDPE over basic catalysts (calcium oxide, calcium aluminate, and calcium ferrite), acidic catalysts (ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 40, 80 and 200, commercial FCC and ZSM-5 based catalysts), and acid-base tandem catalysts were investigated by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS to improve light olefins and aromatics production. Research found that co-pyrolysis of pine and LDPE showed a positive synergistic effect and the addition of catalyst could reduce the average apparent activation energy of co-pyrolysis significantly. The optimal base and acid catalysts are calcium aluminate (CaAl) and ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 40 (Z40), respectively. The highest content of light olefins and BTX (69.45 %) can be obtained over base-acid (CaAl-Z40) tandem catalyst at 600 °C, with CaAl to Z40 ratio of 1:1. This work will serve as a relevant reference for production of light olefins and BTX from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics over base-acid tandem catalysts.
