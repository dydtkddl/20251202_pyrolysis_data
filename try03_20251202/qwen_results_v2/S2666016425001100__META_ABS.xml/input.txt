Title: Improvement of engine performance, combustion and remarkable reductions in NOx, CO and unburned HC emissions fuelling with mixed plastic pyrolysis oil and oxygenated additives
Abstract: Global emissions from the transportation sector are one of the reasons for climate change. This study aims to use waste-plastic-derived pyrolysis oils in a diesel engine to reduce exhaust emissions and improve engine performance. Pyrolysis oils were derived from waste plastics and oils were tested in a diesel engine effectively by blending with diesel and oxygenated additives. The experimental results were validated with simulation results. The key findings are the remarkable reductions in carbon monoxide (CO, 74.4 %), unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC, 62.1 %), and nitrogen oxide (NOx, 18.96 %) emissions without deteriorating engine performance at all engine operating conditions.
