Title: Effect of reduction temperatures of Ni-modified zeolites on the product distribution, catalyst deactivation, and reaction mechanism during polypropylene pyrolysis
Abstract: Introducing Ni into ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts stands as an efficacious strategy for augmenting catalytic activity in the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Thermal reduction using H2 serves as a customary approach to convert Ni2+ species to Ni0, bolstering the catalytic efficacy in aromatics conversion. However, thermal treatment is prone to precipitating the agglomeration of Ni metal, leading to a diminution in the active sites of the catalyst. Therefore, this work focused on the effect that arose from different reduction temperatures on the PP catalytic thermal degradation process. According to the analysis of the reduced Ni-modified ZSM-5 catalysts, the size of Ni particles loaded onto the ZSM-5 support progressively increased with escalating reduction temperatures, ranging from 21.7 to 30.5 nm. Excessive size hindered the conversion of Ni0 which played a key role in the acid properties. Moreover, it was discovered that the H2 yield and aromatics proportions increased linearly with the strong acid amount and total B/L ratio, respectively. By contrast, the modified catalyst treated at 500 °C displayed superior catalytic performance. Additionally, coke generation was favored by the enlarged size of Ni particles. These findings were instrumental in advancing the development of reduced metal catalysts utilized in the thermal conversion treatment of plastic waste.
