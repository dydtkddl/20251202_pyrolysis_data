Title: Coupling dechlorination and catalytic pyrolysis to produce carbon nanotubes from mixed polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene
Abstract: The presence of chlorine in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) presents a major challenge for realizing the high-value utilization of real waste plastics. The objective of this research was to develop a chlorine-resistant process for the preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from mixed plastics containing PVC. This study investigates the influence of PVC content and various dechlorinating agents (CaO, Na2CO3, red mud (RM), ZSM-5, Fe-Al2O3, Fe(OH)3) on CNTs formation. The results showed that PVC content exceeding 5 % significantly inhibits CNTs formation. Employing dechlorinating agents in the pyrolysis process results in a substantial yield of CNTs from mixed plastics containing 10 % PVC. Among the dechlorinating agents, RM proves to be the most effective, leading to the highest carbon yield (at 30 wt%) and superior CNTs quality. Other dechlorinating agents, except for ZSM-5, yield comparable results, although there were some obvious variations of volatiles. Further investigation of the role of dechlorinating agents from the perspective of volatiles evolution was conducted via Py-GC/MS, and found that the dechlorination agent efficiently absorbs the HCl from mixed plastics pyrolysis, while also exhibiting catalytic and regulatory influence on volatile components. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of a chlorine-resistant process in the preparation of CNTs from mixed plastics that contain PVC.
