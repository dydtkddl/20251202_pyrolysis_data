Title: Electricity generation from co-pyrolysis gas of fresh palm fruit bunches and medical waste plastic bottles for sustainable energy applications
Abstract: Co-pyrolysis gas produced from the co-pyrolysis of fresh palm fruit bunches and medical waste plastic bottles using a batch pyrolyzer integrated with a downdraft gasifier was evaluated for sustainable electricity generation. Increasing the plastic fraction enhanced the gas heating value (41.43–55.53 MJ/Nm3) but decreased gas yield from 22.7 % to 9.0 %. Electrical efficiency was calculated based on the ratio of output power to syngas energy content, achieving 8.96–9.01 %. Engine tests showed a reduction in CO emissions (30,149–17,419 ppm) and comparable NOx levels to gasoline combustion. These results demonstrate the co-pyrolysis gas's potential as a renewable fuel for decentralized power.
