Title: Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene for aviation oil production
Abstract: The recycling and reuse of plastics is getting more and more attention all over the world as there are increasing environmental and energy problems. In this study, aviation oil production from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene plastics was detailed. The yields and components of oils at different microwave absorbent loads (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 g SiC), microwave powers (450, 550, 650, 750, and 850 W), and pyrolysis temperatures (340, 400, 460, 520, and 580 °C) were elaborated for the target of aviation oil production. The results showed that the oil yield improved initially and then declined within the range of 56.00–98.78 wt% when there were increases in the microwave absorbent load, microwave power, or pyrolysis temperature. The highest oil yield (98.78 wt%) in the world was obtained at SiC load of 60 g, microwave power of 650 W, and pyrolysis temperature of 460 °C. The main components of the oils contained monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloalkenes with C8-C16 as the majority (64.794–85.932 area%). The results showed that microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene achieved the highest oil yield in the world, and the oil has the potential to be converted into aviation oil.
