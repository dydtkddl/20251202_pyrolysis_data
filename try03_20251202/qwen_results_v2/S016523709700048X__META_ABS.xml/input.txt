Title: Analysis of products derived from the fast pyrolysis of plastic waste
Abstract: Plastic Waste has become an increased problem in many industrialised countries. Concern over the volumes being created has lead to a number of governments introducing new legislation for its recovery as a resource. Traditional recovery methods have generally concentrated on recycling of materials or incineration for energy. The majority of polymers in waste are mainly hydrocarbon in nature and so can be used as a feedstock for the chemical industries or as a fuel. Pyrolysis is a tertiary recycling process and has an ability to provide three end products: a gas, an oil and a char which all have the potential to be further utilised. It is anticipated that if waste recovery targets currently being set are to be met then methods, such as pyrolysis, will have to be closely examined. The pyrolysis of a plastic mixture in a fluidised bed reactor was studied. The mixture was a simulated fraction of that found in municipal solid waste in Europe. The reactor was constructed of stainless steel and was 70 cm high × 10 cm diameter, with a 17 cm high × 20 cm diameter expander section. The sample was introduced batchwise into the bed. The influence of temperature on product yield and composition was studied. Pyrolysis was carried out at temperatures between 500 and 700°C. This gave widely differing product yields of between 9.79 and 88.76% gas and between 18.44 and 57.11% oil. The oils were analysed for their functional groups using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The molecular weight distribution was also determined using size exclusion chromatography. It was found that as temperature was increased the amount of aromatic compounds in the oil increased. The molecular weight range was also affected. Potential applications for the oils was also investigated.
