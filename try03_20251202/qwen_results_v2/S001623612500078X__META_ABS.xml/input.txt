Title: Catalytic co-pyrolysis of tobacco stem and polypropylene over Ni/CaO-Al2O3: synergistic production and distribution of pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes
Abstract: Inexpensive metal oxides are the promising catalyst supports for catalytic pyrolysis to produce pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The catalytic co-pyrolysis of tobacco stem (TS) and recycled plastic (PP) is conducted using a Ni/CaO-Al2O3 catalyst with varying CaO/Al2O3 ratios (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1) in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Subsequently, TS and PP were decomposed at high temperature to produce pyrolysis oil and H2-rich pyrolysis gas, while CNTs were synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the deposited catalyst (FeMo/MgO). The results demonstrated that Ni-based dual-support catalysts exhibit high total acidity (17–110 mmol/g) and optimal reduction temperature (300–600 °C). This is conducive to improve the catalytic cracking reactivity, improve product quality, and achieve CO2 fixation. Ni/Ca-50 enhances C–H cracking, resulting in the production of hydrogen (46 %) and short-chain hydrocarbons, which is beneficial for generating higher-quality CNTs on the deposited catalyst with an ID/IG ratio of 0.52. Meanwhile, Ni/Ca-25 achieved the highest hydrocarbon content (65 %), fostering the generation of carbon source gases necessary for producing high-yield CNTs on FeMo/MgO, evidenced by a TPO weight loss of 40 %. The highly selective Ni-based dual-support catalysts hold significant potential for application in catalytic co-pyrolysis, paving the way for the widespread and large-scale deployment of pyrolysis technology.
