Title: Rheological property analysis of pyrolytic liquid fuel (PLF) using ASTM and APHA standards
Abstract: In this paper expounds, to apply the pyrolysis impact on plastic solid wastes (PSW) to pyrolytic liquid fuel and characterize the potential and rheological properties of produced pyrolytic liquid fuel was explored from the view point of energy vitality and waste minimization. Fundamentally, the plastic solid wastes such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) were pyrolyzed in a pyrolytic reactor which operated at optimum temperature 450 °C under atmospheric pressure. Subsequently, the rheological properties of pyrolytic liquid fuel such as pH, relative density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, cloud point, pour point and calorific value are analyzed by standard American society for testing and materials (ASTM) and American public health association (APHA) methods. The comparison of pyrolytic fuel with conventional fuels can avowing that the produced pyrolytic liquid fuel as an alternative liquid fuel which can supplant the fuel shortage and providing an enthusiasm to the researcher to concentrating on plastic thermal cracking. Hence, the pyrolytic liquid fuel has been proved that could be the suitable replacement of conventional fuel in terms of calorific value.
