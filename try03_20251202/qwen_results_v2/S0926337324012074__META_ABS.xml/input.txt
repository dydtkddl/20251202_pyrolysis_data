Title: Shaped zeolites Y for polypropylene cracking
Abstract: This study focuses on chemical interactions occurring between commercially available FAU zeolites, with various Si/Al ratios (Si/Al = 2.5, 6, and 31), micro- and mesoporosity, acidic properties, and a γ-Al2O3 used as a binder to produce extrudates. The extrudates are characterised by conventional techniques that provide information on their structure, texture, and acidic features and are compared to their parent powders. The catalytic performances of the zeolite powders, their derived alumina extrudates, and physical mixtures of zeolites/γ-Al2O3 are evaluated in polypropylene catalytic cracking. A detailed thermogravimetric and spectroscopic (operando FT-IR-GC-MS) analysis of the reaction, including catalyst coking and regeneration, shows the emergence of rules to design fit-for-purpose catalysts. IR spectroscopy-derived number, nature, and strength of the acid sites are consistent with the catalytic results, highlighting the role of new catalytic sites located on the external or mesoporous surfaces of the zeolites, i.e., at the zeolite-binder interface. This illustrates that binding and subsequent thermal treatment of zeolite powders to produce industrially relevant catalysts determine the quality and quantity of active sites not always present in pure powders, typically reported in the open literature. During the shaping process, neither the strength nor accessibility of the native zeolite acid sites are affected, but chemical interactions between γ-Al2O3 and the zeolite generate new Brønsted acid sites, increasing catalytic performances in polypropylene cracking. This study is also a blueprint for other zeolites/binders forming processes (spray-drying, oil-dropping, pelletising) and could also be influential in shaping adsorbents. It is remarkable that, despite a significant dilution (50 %) of USY zeolites with γ-Al2O3, no significant change in catalytic activity is observed while the newly created sites improve selectivity towards lighter hydrocarbons.
