Title: The mechanism of carbon sphere formation from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolysis: an experimental and ReaxFF simulation study
Abstract: HDPE pyrolysis to carbon spheres offers a sustainable route aligned with circular-economy principles. In this study, HDPE was pyrolyzed in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor between 500 °C and 900 °C to investigate product evolution and the carbon sphere formation mechanism. Below 800 °C, the liquid products are predominantly waxes and oils; solid carbon spheres start to be formed at 800 °C, with their yield increasing monotonically with temperature, reaching 21 wt% at 900 °C. Carbon spheres exhibit a relatively disordered internal structure, rich in defects, while higher temperatures promote the development of more ordered graphitic domains. Carbon spheres grow synergistically through aggregation and graphite growth. ReaxFF-MD simulations elucidate the molecular-scale transformation: CH bond scission generates carbon and hydrogen radicals, which repolymerize into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These PAHs then grow and coalesce through CC coupling into curved graphitic layers that nucleate carbon spheres. The study establishes a temperature-dependent growth model and offers mechanistic insight valuable for plastic recycling and the controlled pyrolytic synthesis of carbon spheres.
