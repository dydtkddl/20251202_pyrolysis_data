Title: N-doped carbon carriers loaded with NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu): Catalytic synergistic pyrolysis of herbal residues and polypropylene to generate three-phase products and carbon nanotubes
Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis can transform organic solid waste into high-quality pyrolysis products, in which N-doped biochar is an efficient and economical catalyst. Herein, N-doped activated carbon (NAC) and modified biochar (NZC) loaded with bimetal NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu) were used to catalyze the pyrolysis of Chinese medicinal drug residue and polypropylene in a two-stage reaction system to prepare three-phase products and carbon nanotubes. This indicates that the metal/NAC group catalysts possess a larger SBET, whereas the metal/NZC group has better thermal stability. Under NiCo/NZC catalysis, the abundant yield of short-chain carbon C6-C11(49 %) and aromatic hydrocarbons (39.5 %) suggests strong arylation and secondary cracking capabilities. N-doping improved the surface functional group richness of the catalyst, while the bimetal provided more active electrons, which promoted the generation of carbon nanotubes in the late stage of the pyrolysis process. N-doped carbon-based catalysts loaded with metals exhibit an improved catalytic effect, which is conducive to the promotion and application of N-doped catalysts.
