Title: Optimization of liquid fuel production from co-pyrolysis of oil palm fronds and expanded polystyrene using response surface methodology
Abstract: The transformation of plastic and biomass waste into fuel promotes sustainable energy alternatives and efficient waste management. In this study, liquid fuel production from co-pyrolysis of oil palm fronds (PF) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) was experimentally investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The effect of process temperature (T, 300–500 °C), and PF-to-EPS ratio (R, 0.1 to 9) on pyrolysis oil yield (YPO) and PAH's composition (PAHC) was studied using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD). PF-to-EPS ratio (R) was found to be the most significant process parameter for determining the YPO, while T was the most influential process parameter affecting PAHC. The maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 80.11 wt% and minimum PAH composition of 20.63 % area was obtained at an optimum T of 395 °C and 0.1 R. The pyrolysis oil also contained benzene with a concentration below the established standards. The pyrolysis oil produced under optimum conditions had a calorific value of 41.56 MJ/kg, kinematic viscosity at 40 °C of 0.85 mm2/s, density at 15 °C of 0.93 g/cm3, water content of 0.24 wt%, acidity of 3.46 mg KOH/g, and a flash point of 26.05 °C. Pyrolysis oil can potentially improve gasoline's octane rating because of its high aromatic compound content.
