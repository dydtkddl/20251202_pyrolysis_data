Title: Isothermal pyrolysis and gasification characteristics and gas products of ethylene vinyl acetate and back sheets in end-of-life photovoltaic module thermal treatment recovery
Abstract: Removing the back sheets (TPT, Tedlar / Polyethylene terephthalate / Tedlar) and encapsulants (EVA, ethylene vinyl acetate) through pyrolysis is a promising method for the efficient recycling of photovoltaic cells. A self-developed isothermal thermogravimetric analyzer was used to study the TPT and EVA pyrolysis characteristics as well as their gas products. Based on the release behavior of the gas products, a novel release pathway for CO2 during EVA pyrolysis was proposed. EVA pyrolysis with no residue at 450 °C in the 20 % O2 atmosphere within 30 min, making it possible to recycle PV materials with low energy consumption. TPT showed a two-stage characteristic in 20 % O2 and the residual from the first stage of TPT pyrolysis was able to be oxidized in the second reaction stage. The main gas products generated by the isothermal pyrolysis of EVA were CO2, C3H6, and CH4. Reusing the gas products was worthwhile since their lower calorific value reached 57.60 MJ/Nm3. The primary gas products of TPT pyrolysis were CO2, CH4, and C2H4. Different from temperature programmed pyrolysis, part of the acetyl groups in EVA formed CO2 directly but not acetic acid at high temperatures, and the CO2 release continued the whole isothermal pyrolysis.
