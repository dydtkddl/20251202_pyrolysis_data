Title: Analysis of liquid products and mechanism of thermal/catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene
Abstract: Rapid thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) were carried out using Py-GC/MS. The distribution of products of rapid pyrolysis and the influence of FCC catalyst on pyrolysate production were studied both qualitatively and quantitatively at the temperature of 500 °C. The corresponding reaction pathways were suggested based on the experimental results. The results showed that the olefin content of PP cracking products exceeded 99 wt. %, which were monoolefines with carbon number of 3n and diolefins with carbon number of 3n+1, respectively, and only a very small amount of alkanes. The catalyst promoted the formation of monolefine and decreased the content of diolefin. With the addition of catalyst, the content of small molecular weight monolefine between C9 and C21 increased by 13.6 wt. %, while the diolefin content of C15+ decreased to varying degrees. The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of PP can be reasonably explained using free radical mechanism and carbonium ion mechanism, respectively.
