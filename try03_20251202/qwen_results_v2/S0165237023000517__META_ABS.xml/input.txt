Title: A critical review of the correlative effect of process parameters on pyrolysis of plastic wastes
Abstract: Plastics contribute significantly to the plight of an ideal solid waste management system, and the dilemma of its safe disposal upon harnessing its untapped potential still looms large. An appropriate answer to such a predicament is an energy conversion technology that deems both economically and environmentally profitable. Pyrolysis of plastic wastes has been attempted for commercialisation unsuccessfully throughout the last decade, owing to the substandard economisation of the process and non-compliance of its products to emission standards. Though the pyrolysis technology and the parameters involved have been extensively studied, a gap exists in the practical implementation due to its complex mechanism involving many variables that play a significant role in products' yield, distribution and the system's overall performance. The present work strives to statistically analyse the effect of feedstock and other operational parameters on pyrolysis oil yield and quantify their impacts utilising Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The intensity and significance of the impact of the operational parameters are studied, and a ranking system is attempted to help in the technology's successful priority-optimisation technique and implementation. The results suggested that the reaction temperature is the most critical parameter, with positive PCCs of 0.857 and 0.855 for pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis, respectively. The percentages of Carbon and Hydrogen (H %), residence time, heating rate (HR) and amount of catalyst exhibited positive correlations with oil yield. Among the negatively correlated parameters, the moisture content in feedstock presented a high PCC of − 0.830, followed by particle size. This work presents a collective statistical quantification that aids us in the priority-based optimisation of the pyrolysis process.
