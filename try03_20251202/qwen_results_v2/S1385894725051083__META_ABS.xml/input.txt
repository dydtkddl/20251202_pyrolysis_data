Title: Millisecond dwell time enables closed-loop recycling of polypropylene waste plastics: effects of pyrolysis parameters on low-carbon olefin and carbon nanosphere formation
Abstract: Thermochemical methods offer a promising solution for converting waste plastics into high-value fuels or chemicals, helping to reduce plastic accumulation in the environment and promote sustainable development. However, existing methods typically require secondary processing to effectively produce low-carbon olefin (C2-C4) monomers, such as ethylene and propylene, making true closed-loop recycling difficult to achieve. To address this, the present study introduces a new approach based on Flash Joule Heating (FJH) technology, which efficiently deconstructs polypropylene (PP) plastic in millisecond residence time, yielding low-carbon olefins. By optimizing reaction parameters, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins can reach up to 84 %. Increasing the reaction temperature promotes chain hydrocarbon radical cyclization, Diels-Alder reactions, and subsequent dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of aromatic compounds that undergo thermal polycondensation to produce carbon nanospheres with particle sizes ranging from 100 to 180 nm. This lab-scale study demonstrates the potential for efficient closed-loop recycling of PP waste plastics, providing valuable insights to advance the practical application of closed-loop recycling technologies for waste plastics.
