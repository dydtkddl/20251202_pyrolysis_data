Title: Kinetic study of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolysis
Abstract: In this study, 15mg samples of high density polyethylene (HDPE) were pyrolysed in an isothermal thermogravimetric set-up in a micro-thermobalance reactor with pre-set temperatures. The objective was to study the thermal degradation behaviour of the polymer and determine the kinetic rate constants and overall activation energy (E o). Yielded pyrolysis products under different temperatures were analyzed and lumped into the following categories: rich gases (C 1 –C 4), liquids (non-aromatic C 5 –C 10), aromatics (single ring structures), waxes ( C 11) and char. It was observed that the gas yield was increasing with the operating temperature. Data obtained enabled us to propose a novel kinetic modelling approach based on the thermal cracking of the polymer by primary and secondary depolymerisation reactions to form the pyrolysis products. The E o was estimated to be 147.25kJmol−1 for the total conversion of HDPE in isothermal pyrolysis.
