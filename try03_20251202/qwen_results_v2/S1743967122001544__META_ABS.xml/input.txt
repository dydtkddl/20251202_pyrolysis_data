Title: Thermocatalytic co-pyrolysis of waste biomass and plastics: Studies of physicochemical properties, kinetics behaviour, and characterization of liquid product
Abstract: The thermocatalytic co-pyrolysis of pine wood and plastics (waste nitrile gloves (WNG) and polystyrene (PS)) into renewable liquid fuel was the focus of the current study. The pyrolysis test is executed in a semi-batch reactor at 600 °C, 80 °C min−1 heating rate, and 100 mL min−1 nitrogen flow rate. The waste plastics and MgO were mixed with PW at 10, 20, and 30 wt% loadings, respectively. The proximate, ultimate, HHV, bulk density, biochemical, extractive, TGA, FTIR, viscosity, density, acidity, and GC-MS methods were used to characterize the raw feeds and pyrolytic oil. The physicochemical analysis of raw feeds confirmed their suitability for use as pyrolysis feedstock. The maximum yield of co-pyrolytic oil is found to be 46.76 and 45.41 wt% for PW + WNG and PS, at 20 wt% however, 48.12 and 48.76 wt% is found to be at PW + PS (20 wt%)+MgO (20 wt%) and PW + WNG (20 wt%)+MgO (20 wt%) respectively. The characterization results of pyrolytic oil validated that co-pyrolytic oil provides an improved yield than the individual pyrolysis of raw feeds. In thermocatalytic co-pyrolytic oil, it was discovered that the viscosity, oxygen content, and moisture had all decreased, whereas the heating value, density, carbon content, and acidity had all significantly increased. FTIR examination of pyrolytic oil established the appearance of aromatics hydrocarbon and oxygenated products, whereas GC-MS results validated a substantial reduction in oxygenated components and an increased hydrocarbon percentage at 20 wt% mixing of waste plastics and catalyst.
