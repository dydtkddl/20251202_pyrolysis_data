Title: Thermal behavior and products characteristics during furfural residue co-pyrolysis with waste plastic
Abstract: Furfural residue (FR) is a biomass waste generated during furfural production, while waste plastic is a common type of organic solid waste. In this study, co-pyrolysis of FR and polypropylene (PP) was carried out to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperature, waste plastic mixing ratio and in-situ catalyst on product properties. It was shown that an increase in the plastic mixing ratio significantly affected the composition of gas and liquid products, with a decrease in oxygenated compounds and an increase in hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil. The CnHm content in pyrolysis gas increased. The hydroxyl (O-H) content in pyrolysis char decreases, and the specific surface area decreases from 375.235 m2/g to 269.569 m2/g. The largest increase in olefin content in oil is achieved at a plastic ratio of 0.6. As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the formation of hydrocarbons is promoted, and the content reaches 55.92 % at 500oC. Aromatic yield (37.5 %) and H2 yield (12.07 %) were highest with the addition of ZSM-5 catalyst, while alkane yield (24.89 %) and CO yield (15.78 %) were highest with MgO catalyst. The acid and ester content of pyrolysis oil decreased while the hydrocarbon content increased when CaO catalyst was used.
