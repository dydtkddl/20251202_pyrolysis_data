Title: Kinetic study of the catalytic cracking of polypropylene in a semibatch stirred reactor
Abstract: A lumped kinetic model including both thermal and catalytic cracking and catalyst decay has been developed for the cracking of polypropylene in a semibatch stirred reactor. Two decay equations in where the catalyst decay is either a function of time on stream or function of coke on catalyst have been tested. The kinetic model fits very well the experimental results and is able to simulate the process in a wide range of operating conditions.
