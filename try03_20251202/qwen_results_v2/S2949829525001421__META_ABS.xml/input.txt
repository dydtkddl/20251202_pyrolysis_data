Title: Enhancing CNT yield and morphology from waste plastics: A study on catalyst composition and performance
Abstract: Waste plastic such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was catalytically pyrolyzed and decomposed to produce carbon nanotubes. Single metallic (Ni, Fe, Co) and bimetallic catalysts (Fe:Ni, Co:Ni, and Fe:Co) with active metals in the ratio of 1:3, 3:1, and 1:1, in which Mo is the promoter and Al2O3 as the catalyst support, they were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The catalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractogram (XRD), BET analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The synthesized carbon nanotubes were performed to assess each bimetallic catalyst's level of activity. Furthermore, the yield, purity, diameter, and number of walls in carbon nanotubes of products synthesized from LDPE using various ratios of bimetallic catalysts were compared. Results show that single metallic catalysts produced single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of diameter ranging from 2.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and bimetallic catalysts produced multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that have a diameter between 20.7 nm and 38.6 nm. Among single and bimetallic catalysts, Ni/Mo/Al2O3 and Fe:Ni (1:3)/ Mo/Al2O3 catalysts contributed to the high quality of carbon nanotubes with well-defined morphology and strong graphitization. In terms of yield, Fe/Mo/Al2O3 and Fe:Ni (3:1)/Mo/Al2O3 catalysts yield a maximum of about 37.2 % and 46.4 % CNTs, respectively. This study offers important insights into the catalytic pyrolysis process for recycling LDPE waste plastics by illustrating the connection between catalyst structure, CNT generation, and the shape of CNT. The results provide an efficient approach to developing superior CNTs while promoting environmental sustainability and the management of plastic waste.
