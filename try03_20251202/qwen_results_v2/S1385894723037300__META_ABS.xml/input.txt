Title: Simultaneous removal of microplastics and doxycycline and preparation of novel hollow carbon nanocakes by pyrolysis
Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) pose a significant challenge in terms of their safe disposal and effective utilization. This study aimed to address this issue by employing coagulation and pyrolysis to achieve the simultaneous removal of MPs and doxycycline (DC). Through the addition of nano micro-electrolysis material (nMET) prior to poly ferric sulfate (PS) and polyacrylamide (PAM) coagulation, 92% of DC and 96% of MPs in wastewater were successfully removed. The resulting product from this process is a new type of hollow carbon nanocakes (HCNCs) obtained through pyrolysis. Characterization of the HCNCs reveals that they consist of amorphous carbon, ferric oxide, and zero-valent iron, with a diameter, thickness, specific surface area, and ID/IG of approximately 350 nm, 50 nm, 54.37 m2g−1, and 0.92, respectively. The cavity structure of the HCNCs is formed during the pyrolysis process as CO2 escapes between interstitial compounds. This research not only expands the potential applications of nMET in the environmental field but also presents a method for producing new iron-carbon materials by utilizing waste MPs.
