Title: Stability of ZSM-11 and BETA zeolites during the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene
Abstract: The stability of H-ZSM-11 (H-Z) and H-BETA (H-B) zeolites during the catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied using the same sample of catalyst in eleven consecutive cycles. The gaseous hydrocarbons, liquid hydrocarbons and waxes generated in each cycle were analyzed as well as the used catalyst. The zeolites were characterized by XRD, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine and N2 adsorption, while the physical mixtures of LDPE/zeolites were subjected to TG-DTG analysis.The H-Z zeolite exhibited an important stability during the successive cycles of LDPE conversion. On the contrary, the behavior H-B zeolite was completely different; from the sixth cycle the yields of products changed progressively, approaching to that obtained in a purely thermal process. The yields of accumulated coke increased steadily throughout the cycles up to maximum values in the eleventh cycle of ∼6 and ∼15wt% for H-Z and H-B, respectively. These results were confirmed by TG under air flow.
