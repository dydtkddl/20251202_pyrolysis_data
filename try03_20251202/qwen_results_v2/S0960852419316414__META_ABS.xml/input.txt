Title: Synthesis and characterization of sulfonated activated carbon as a catalyst for bio-jet fuel production from biomass and waste plastics
Abstract: Sulfonated activated carbon-based catalysts were prepared by microwaved-assisted carbonization of phosphoric acid activated corncob followed by sulfonation using concentrated sulfuric acid. Sulfonation at different temperatures and times resulted in varied SO3H group density of the SAC catalysts. Sulfonation temperature showed a significant effect on the introduction of SO3H on the AC precursor while time had minor role. The SAC catalysts were characterized by means of N2 sorption analysis (specific surface area, pore-volume, average pore width), FTIR spectroscopy, SEM imaging, and sulfur analysis. The impact of catalysts SO3H density on the product distribution and bio-oil composition from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir and LDPE was evaluated. The highest bio-jet fuels (aromatics and C9-16 alkanes) obtained was 97.51% using the SAC catalyst sulfonated at 100 °C for 5 h. Results showed that SAC has great potential as catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics for the production of jet-fuel range hydrocarbons.
