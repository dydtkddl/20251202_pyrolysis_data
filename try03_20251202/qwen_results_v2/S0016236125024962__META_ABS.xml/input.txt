Title: Analytical and experimental study of switchgrass and agricultural plastic co-pyrolysis in a microwave reactor
Abstract: This work describes initial results from microwave co-pyrolysis of switchgrass and agricultural plastic waste in the form of polyethylene (PE) hay bale covers. Analytical pyrolysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to better understand the volatile composition and thermal decomposition behavior during co-pyrolysis. Experimental microwave pyrolysis was carried out in a 1.2 kW multimode microwave cavity to pyrolyze 100 g of feedstock mixed with activated carbon absorber at different temperatures (350, 400, 500, 550, and 600 °C) and the product compositions were analyzed. The liquid and wax product compositions were found to have an additive effect, where switchgrass mainly contributed to the liquid fraction and PE mainly contributed to the hydrocarbon fraction. The greatest recovery of condensable organics was obtained at 400 °C with a greater proportion of organic liquids and 600 °C with a greater proportion of waxes. Further, the waxy fraction was converted into pitch to investigate a potential high value application for this fraction that is difficult to thermally decompose.
