Title: Preparation of high-value carbon nanotubes from real waste plastic towards the negative carbon technology
Abstract: The preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from plastics is of great significance for realizing high value utilization of waste and reducing carbon emission. Here, several kinds of real waste plastics were introduced into catalytic pyrolysis, and the process was also optimized. The results showed that the presence of impurities (e.g., adhesive labels) reduced the initial activation energy of the pyrolysis reaction, and the pyrolysis process was extended and could be divided into two stages. During the catalytic process, impurities play a toxic role on the catalyst at higher temperatures and result in the agglomeration of catalyst particles and a decrease in catalytic activity. Less than 10 wt.% carbon fibers were collected from milk cup waste. However, after experimental optimization, the influence of the impurity component was greatly reduced. The toxic effect of organic impurity volatiles on a catalyst was avoided by employing a segmented catalytic pyrolysis process, which led to an increase in solid carbon content of more than 20 % for express package waste. Simultaneously, more uniform and smoother CNTs can be found in the obtained solid carbon. The process of preparing carbon nanotubes with higher yield and better quality is feasible and has important application prospects in the utilization of waste plastics.
