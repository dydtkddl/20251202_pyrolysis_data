Title: A novelty catalytic reforming of tire pyrolysis oil for hydrogen-rich syngas
Abstract: Pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis char from waste tires have been reported with poor quality but could be a source and catalyst for generating hydrogen-rich syngas, respectively. In this study, the influence of two-layer catalysts on the catalytic reforming syngas distribution derived from side wall rubber pyrolysis oil (SWRPO) was explored. The side wall rubber pyrolysis char (SWRC), as a catalyst and carrier support of nickel, was used as the first-layer catalyst, and the calcined bottom ash (CBA) from oil sludge combustion was used as the secondary catalyst. Steam was used as an activator to activate SWRC and improve the concentration of CO and H2 in catalytic reforming syngas. Different analysis methods (BET, XRD, SEM, and Raman) were employed to characterize the properties of catalysts. Consequently, the yield and LHV of syngas increased from 0.05 g·goil −1 and 2.03 kJ·g−1 to 0.42 g·goil −1 and 11.32 kJ·g−1, respectively. The H2 concentration increased from 20.38 vol% to 44.68 vol% in syngas with two-layer catalysts, and the H2 selectivity reached 0.16. The yield of carbon deposit increased to 0.57 g·goil −1 with the SWRPO total conversion of 95.55 %. The lifetime of two-layer catalysts reached 17 h with a stability conversion process of SWRPO.
