Title: Vacuum pyrolysis of PVCII: Product analysis
Abstract: Vacuum pyrolysis of pure PVC at various temperatures and under a total pressure of 2 kPa has been performed to identify and quantify the main pyrolysis products obtained during the different stages of thermal degradation. A system consisting of a bench scale batch reactor with a condensation train was used to collect the pyrolysis products. The main gaseous and liquid products including the chlorinated hydrocarbons obtained at different temperatures were identified and quantified by chromatographic methods. Global mass balance and chlorine mass balance were determined and different techniques to capture HCl under vacuum conditions were tested. The solid residue was analyzed and characterized for elemental composition, surface properties and calorific value. The advantages of the vacuum pyrolysis process and the potential difficulties expected during large scale pyrolysis treatment of PVC are briefly discussed.
