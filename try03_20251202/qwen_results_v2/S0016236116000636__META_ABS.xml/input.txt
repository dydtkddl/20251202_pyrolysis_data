Title: Time and temperature depended fuel gas generation from pyrolysis of real world municipal plastic waste
Abstract: On a large scale, amount of pyrolytic gas generated and their components has a very important role in product recovery in form of energy. The obtained gases having HHV can be utilized for generation of power or can be utilized in the process itself to reduce the input energy and helps to become self sustainable process. In the present study, real world municipal plastic waste mainly comprising of polyethylene (low and high density), polypropylene, polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate were pyrolyzed at different temperatures, ranging 450–600°C with a sample mass of 200g to create an appropriate real blend environment. The non-condensable gaseous product generation profile was studied along with heat transfer profile in reactor. The effect and formation of gaseous products was explained based on experimental investigation which shows an increase in H2 on increasing the temperature with decrease in low molecular weight hydrocarbons. In addition, the identification of non-condensable gaseous components was done using gas chromatography. Effect of residence time was strong at higher temperature process conditions producing heavier hydrocarbons in gas; and in oil as wax. Increase in operating temperature increased the concentration of H2 whereas no effect on formation of CO and CO2 was observed. Recovery time of non-condensable gases was less at higher temperature whereas yield increases on increasing the operating temperature. Residence time of volatiles in reactor affected the formation of hydrocarbons like ethylene, propane and n-butane.
