Title: The role of catalyst acidity and microstructure on light olefin selectivity in polyethylene deconstruction in short contact time pulse Joule-heated reactors
Abstract: The growing volume of plastics waste, compounded with a low recycling rate, has led to an alarming amount of plastics ending up in landfills or being incinerated. While pyrolysis offers a route for plastic waste deconstruction, its product distribution is often broad and poorly controlled due to unselective radical chemistry at high temperatures. We recently demonstrated that rapid pulse Joule-heated catalytic cracking over HZSM-5, combined with small fractions of steam, can achieve high selectivity (>80 %) toward C2-C4 olefins, while significantly reducing coking compared to continuous Joule heating. Here, we investigate how acid catalyst properties, such as silica/alumina ratio, zeolite topology, and catalyst porosity, influence light olefin selectivity during polyethylene deconstruction via rapid pulse Joule heating. We demonstrate that silica-to-alumina ratios of ∼30 yield high light olefin selectivity, and small-pore zeolites favor light olefins at the expense of increased coke formation. To mitigate coking, we synthesize HZSM-5 nanosheets and hierarchical zeolites (MFI, FAU, and CHA). These catalysts achieve an ethylene selectivity of approximately 35 %, a twofold increase over prior catalytic pyrolysis. Additionally, co-feeding steam and incorporating hierarchical porosity reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability.
