Title: Tertiary recycling of polyethylene: mechanism of liquid production from polyethylene by thermolysis/reactive distillation
Abstract: Thermolysis coupled with reactive distillation was studied as a potential process for the tertiary recycling of polyethylene. The reactions were carried out at 440°C and under a nitrogen atmosphere. Processing under these conditions allowed for a higher conversion of polyethylene into a condensable liquid product than is usually reported with conventional pyrolysis. The products obtained from this study were characterized by a high concentration of straight-chain α-olefins. The relative importance of the various steps in the mechanism of thermal degradation of polyethylene was found to be very different from that observed in other studies employing just thermolysis or pyrolysis. In addition to molecular weight reduction by random scission, intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen transfer steps were found to be very important to the production of liquid. Intramolecular hydrogen transfer followed by β-scission was also found to be an important mechanism for the production of short chain length α-olefins.
