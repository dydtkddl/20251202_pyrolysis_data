Title: Enhancing bio-oil quality and hydrogen recovery through Co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch and polypropylene over a NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst
Abstract: The increasing accumulation of agricultural residues and plastic waste presents both environmental challenges and opportunities for energy recovery. Conventional disposal methods are inadequate, highlighting the need for efficient thermochemical valorization strategies. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) and oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) using a bimetallic NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the conversion efficiency and product quality of heterogeneous biomass–plastic blends. The originality of this research lies in harnessing synergistic feedstock interactions with a tailored bimetallic catalyst to improve liquid fuel and hydrogen-rich gas yields. Pyrolysis was carried out using a fixed-bed batch reactor at 400–600 °C with varying EFB:PP weight ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100). Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that PP promoted thermal degradation and reduced char formation. The NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a stable structure and homogeneous metal dispersion, which led to enhanced cracking, deoxygenation, and hydrocarbon formation. The optimal performance was observed at a 25:75 EFB:PP ratio, yielding the highest liquid fraction with an improved calorific value and lower density. Gas analysis revealed elevated hydrogen and light hydrocarbon contents at higher PP proportions, demonstrating the function of the catalyst in enhancing reforming reactions. These results demonstrate the critical influence of feedstock blending and catalyst design on optimizing co-pyrolysis for sustainable production of biofuels and hydrogen-rich syngas.
