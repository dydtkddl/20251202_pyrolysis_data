Title: Enhancing hydrogen production from municipal solid waste through an integrated pyrolysis and microbial fermentation approach
Abstract: Pyrolysis is a well-established method for hydrogen generation from municipal solid waste (MSW); however, limited research has explored its integration with microbial fermentation to optimize hydrogen yield. This study introduces an innovative two-stage process combining pyrolysis (450–900 °C) and microbial fermentation to maximize hydrogen production while enabling closed-loop resource utilization. The pyrolysis stage achieved peak hydrogen yields of 489.26 mL/g (580 °C, 500 mesh) and 475.24 mL/g (900 °C). Subsequently, a microbial agent (Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Clostridium spp., and PET-degrading strains) was optimized to ferment pyrolysis residues, yielding 301 mL/g hydrogen at 38 °C. Post-fermentation residues enhanced soil organic matter by 15 %, demonstrating dual benefits for energy recovery and soil remediation. This work advances sustainable MSW management by integrating thermochemical and biological processes, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon-neutral waste valorization.
