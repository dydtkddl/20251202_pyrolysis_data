Title: Mitigation of bromine-containing products during pyrolysis of polycarbonate-based tetrabromobisphenol A in the presence of copper(I) oxide
Abstract: Polycarbonate (PC) is an engineering thermoplastic that is widely used in electrical and electronic equipment. This plastic often contains tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), the most common brominated flame retardant. Thermal degradation of the PC-TBBA leads to generation of numerous bromo-organic products in the pyrolytic oil, hindering its appropriate utilization, as well as corrosive hydrogen bromide gas. The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate and compare the pyrolysis products of PC-TBBA and PC-TBBA + Cu2O at various temperatures, with an emphasis on the yield and distribution of brominated compounds. In pyrolysis of PC-TBBA + Cu2O, at the maximum degradation temperature (600 °C), as much as 86% of total Br was trapped in the residue, while 3% and 11% were distributed in the condensate and gas fractions, respectively. In contrast, the distribution of Br from non-catalytic pyrolysis of PC-TBBA (600 °C) was 0.5% residue, 40% condensate, and 60% gas. The results of this study revealed that in the presence of Cu2O, organo-bromine products were most likely involved in Ullman-type coupling reactions, leading to early cross-linking of the polymer network that efficiently hinders their vaporization. HBr in the gas fraction was suppressed due to effective fixation of bromine in residue in the form of CuBr.
