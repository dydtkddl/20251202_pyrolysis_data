Title: Depolymerization-liquefaction of plastics and rubbers. 2. Polystyrenes and styrene-butadiene copolymers
Abstract: The depolymerization-liquefaction reactions of representative polystyrene and styrene-butadiene co-polymer (non-vulcanized SBR) samples were systematically investigated as a function of processing variables, i.e. temperature (350–450°C), time (15–120 min), H2 pressure (500–2500 psig), and the presence of catalysts. Two solid superacids, i.e. Fe2O3 SO4 2− and ZrO2 SO4 2− , which differ in acidity were used in the study. The detailed composition of products was determined by GC/MS. Typical products from a polystyrene sample (average MW, 280 000) contained benzene, toluene, (C2C5) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, 1,3-diphenylalkanes and triphenylalkanes, accompanied by some indanes, tetralins, naphthalenes and polyphenyls, whereas products from non-vulcanized SBR (MW, 140 000) contained, in addition to the above, C5C9 paraffins and cycloparaffins, (C5C8) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, cyclopentylbenzenes, and cyclohexylbenzenes. The changes in product composition as a function of the above processing variables were determined and conditions for preferential (> 85 wt.%) production of gasoline-range liquid fuels established. The observed change in composition as a function of reaction time and temperature allowed for elucidation of mechanistic aspects of high-temperature depolymerization-liquefaction processes, including the role of catalytic effects.
