Title: Cold plasma-assisted co-conversion of polyolefin wastes and CO2 into aromatics over hierarchical Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst
Abstract: Cold plasma-assisted catalytic upcycling of polyolefin wastes integrated with CO2 into value-added chemicals is a promising solution for mitigating the global carbon emissions and fossil energy crisis, but still challenging due to the complexity of products and low energy efficiency. Given this, a novel one-stage process of cold plasma coupled with Ga-modified hierarchical H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Hie-ZSM-5) catalyst for polyolefins upgrading was designed with polyolefins followed by the catalysts within the plasma region, which facilitated the upcycling of polyolefins to light olefins and CO2 activation by plasma, and thereby the enhanced synergy between cold plasma and catalysts for aromatics production. At an input power of ca. 45 W without external heating, the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste was completely converted with the assistance of CO2 and the yield of oil products over the Ga/Hie-ZSM-5 catalyst was highly up to 62.2 wt%, with nearly 100% selectivity of aromatics. Meanwhile, the degradation efficiency of LDPE and the energy efficiency could reach 2.5 gLDPE⋅gcat −1⋅h−1 and 55.56 gLDPE⋅gcat −1⋅kW−1⋅h−1, respectively. Mechanism investigation revealed that the plasma and CO2 synergistically affect the primary cracking of LDPE, forming a primary product enriched in olefins and a small amount of CO. Subsequently, the produced olefins intermediates were further aromatized via cyclization-dehydrogenation route on the Ga/Hie-ZSM-5 catalyst with assistance of CO2 under the synergistic effect of plasma-catalysis. This work offers a feasible strategy to improve the yield of aromatic products for the plasma-catalytic upcycling of polyolefins and CO2 at ambient pressure without any external heating.
