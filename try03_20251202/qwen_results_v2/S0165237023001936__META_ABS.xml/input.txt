Title: Comparing bed materials for fluidized bed steam cracking of high-density polyethylene: Olivine, bauxite, silica-sand, and feldspar
Abstract: Steam cracking in fluidized beds is an alternative method for producing valuable petrochemicals from plastic waste. Previous studies on the conversion of plastics in fluidized beds have revolved around non-catalytic cracking using silica sand as the bed material. On the other hand, studies on catalytic cracking have focused on the use of active materials such as olivine, bauxite, feldspar, and zeolites. The potential influence of the above-mentioned materials, in their natural or inactive state, on fluidized bed hydrocarbon cracking, is not well-documented in the literature. In this paper, steam cracking of polyethylene in a bubbling fluidized bed at 750 °C is investigated in the presence of four different natural ores: olivine, bauxite, silica sand, and feldspar. The paper compares the performance of the steam cracking process in terms of cracking severity, conversion, and product distribution among different hydrocarbon groups. The results show that there is only a marginal difference in cracking severity among the different bed materials, while the conversion remain relatively consistent, ranging from 93% to 95% (carbon.%). The yields of paraffins and carbon oxides are narrow, ranging from 15% to 16% and 3–4%, respectively, while the yields of light olefins and aromatics show a slightly wider range. The yield of olefins is in the range of 52–57%, and for aromatics, it ranges from 16% to 21%. The paper also discusses the potential impact of these bed materials on the cracking reactions, including their thermal and reactive interactions.
