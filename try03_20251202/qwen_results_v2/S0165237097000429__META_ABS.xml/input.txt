Title: Pyrolysis of a fraction of mixed plastic wastes depleted in PVC
Abstract: A fraction of plastic wastes from DSD (Duales System Deutschland) which is depleted in polyvinylchloride (PVC) was pyrolyzed at 638, 690 and 735°C in a technical-scale fluidized bed reactor. At 638°C over 50 wt.% of the pyrolysis product was an oil with a boiling point less than 295°C; this can be used as feedstock in a steam cracker. The experiment at 690°C yielded about 40 wt.% of an oil, about the half of which consists of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX-aromatics). At the highest reaction temperature of 735°C, the main product was a highly aromatized oil; the BTX-aromatics content is about 20 wt.% of the pyrolysis product.
