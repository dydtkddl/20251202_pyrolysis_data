You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS OIL FINGERPRINTING.

Context – Project Goal
----------------------
We are building a database of experimental plastic pyrolysis OIL COMPOSITIONS in order to train models that:
- (a) predict oil composition from plastic feed composition, and
- (b) infer plastic feed composition from measured oil composition (reverse mapping, oil → plastic).

Therefore, a paper is only useful if it provides (or clearly enables extraction of) experimental data about the LIQUID/OIL PRODUCT from plastic or polymer pyrolysis under lab-scale conditions.

Your task
--------
Given the TITLE and ABSTRACT of a paper, you must:

1) Decide whether it is truly about experimental plastic/polymer pyrolysis (NOT simulation-only, review, or non-pyrolysis research), and  
2) Decide whether it should be INCLUDED in an oil-composition-focused database for fingerprint-based reverse inference (oil → plastic).

You must make a TWO-STAGE decision:

Stage 1 – Pyrolysis & Experimental Check (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------------------
The paper must satisfy ALL of the following to pass Stage 1.

1. Plastic or polymer pyrolysis
   - It must involve thermal or catalytic decomposition of plastics or polymers.
   - Typical keywords (not exhaustive): “pyrolysis”, “catalytic pyrolysis”, “thermal cracking”, “thermolysis”, “depolymerization”, “plastic-to-oil”, “waste-to-fuel”, “plastic waste pyrolysis”, etc.
   - Feed can be virgin or waste plastic (e.g., PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, mixed plastics).

2. Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)
   The study must involve actual physical experiments on lab or pilot scale, for example:
   - Bench-scale pyrolysis reactor
   - Lab-scale fixed-bed, batch, semi-batch, fluidized-bed, microwave reactor, tube furnace, etc.
   - Catalyst tests performed in real reactors
   - Real measured outputs such as liquid/oil/wax yields, gas composition, char yield, etc.
   - Experimental characterization: GC, GC-MS, GC-FID, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.

   If the study is ANY of the following, it FAILS Stage 1:
   - Purely computational or simulation-based
   - Kinetic or reactor modeling without new lab experiments
   - LCA-only, TEA-only, or process design/optimization without experiments
   - ML-only, chemometrics-only, or purely theoretical work
   - Review, meta-analysis, perspective, or editorial without new lab data

3. Extractable experimental data
   - The abstract must clearly indicate that some QUANTITATIVE experimental data exist, such as:
     - Liquid/oil/wax yield (absolute or relative)
     - Product yield distributions (oil/gas/char)
     - Catalyst performance comparisons based on measured outputs
     - Temperature–yield or temperature–composition relationships
     - Measured chemical composition (e.g., GC-MS analysis of oil)
     - Engine or combustion tests using produced fuel
   - If it is ambiguous whether any usable experimental data exist, treat this as NO.

Stage 1 decision:
- If ANY of these Stage 1 criteria are not clearly satisfied, set:
  - "pyrolysis_related": "NO"
  - "include_in_oil_db": "NO"
  - Add appropriate Stage 1 flags (see “flags” list below).
- Only if ALL Stage 1 criteria are clearly satisfied, set:
  - "pyrolysis_related": "YES"
  and then continue to Stage 2.

Stage 2 – Oil-Fingerprint Relevance Check
-----------------------------------------
For papers that PASS Stage 1 ("pyrolysis_related": "YES"), decide if they are suitable for inclusion in an OIL-COMPOSITION–FOCUSED database used for reverse inference (oil → plastic).

Key question:
“Does this study provide, or clearly enable extraction of, experimental data about the LIQUID/OIL PRODUCT that reflects the plastic’s characteristic decomposition fingerprint?”

A. POSITIVE (INCLUSION) criteria – Favor these
----------------------------------------------
The paper is a good candidate for inclusion if:

1. Oil-centered output
   - The primary outputs include liquid/oil/wax products from plastic pyrolysis.
   - The study reports oil composition and/or detailed liquid product distribution, for example:
     - GC or GC-MS composition of the oil
     - Monomer/dimer/trimer distributions
     - CxHy distribution, boiling range fractions, or fuel-range fractions
     - Fingerprint patterns typical of specific plastics (e.g., styrene series for PS, long-chain linear hydrocarbons for PE).

2. Single plastic or well-defined plastic feed
   - Especially valuable if the feed is:
     - A single polymer (e.g., pure PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET), or
     - A clearly defined mixture of plastics with known composition.
   - These “single-plastic” or “well-defined mixture” data form the core of the fingerprint reference database.

3. Reasonable catalyst conditions
   - Best case: non-catalytic (thermal) pyrolysis of a single plastic with oil composition data.
   - Also acceptable: widely used, general-purpose catalysts (e.g., common zeolites, typical metal oxides) where results are not overly specific to a unique, one-off catalyst.
   - The focus should remain on the plastic feed and product composition, not on highly specialized catalyst mechanisms.

4. Extractable quantitative information on oil
   - Liquid/oil yield vs temperature
   - Oil vs gas vs char distributions
   - Oil composition from GC/GC-MS
   - Distillation cuts of oil and their properties
   - Data that can be used as fingerprints for plastic-to-oil and oil-to-plastic modeling.

B. NEGATIVE (EXCLUSION) criteria – Exclude from oil DB even if Stage 1 is YES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even if the study is about experimental plastic pyrolysis, EXCLUDE it from the oil DB (set "include_in_oil_db": "NO") if ANY of the following apply:

1. Target product is NOT oil (Hydrogen/CNT/Aromatics-focused)
   - The main purpose is hydrogen production, syngas optimization, CNT or other carbon nanomaterials, or specific aromatics production.
   - Typical patterns:
     - “hydrogen production”, “H2 yield optimization”, “syngas production”
     - “carbon nanotubes”, “CNT synthesis”, “carbon nanofibers”
     - “aromatics production”, “BTX production”, “high aromatics yield”
   - These studies usually:
     - Do not report detailed oil composition, OR
     - Optimize a specific product rather than preserving plastic-specific oil fingerprints.

2. Co-pyrolysis with biomass or coal (tri- or co-pyrolysis)
   - Feed includes plastic + biomass, plastic + coal, or multi-component waste where plastic is only one component.
   - The main focus is on synergy between biomass/coal and plastic, or overall co-pyrolysis behavior.
   - These systems distort pure plastic oil fingerprints.
   - Unless the abstract clearly states that there is a SEPARATE condition of pure plastic alone with oil composition data, treat co-pyrolysis as EXCLUDED by default.

3. Catalyst-mechanism–centered studies
   - Main emphasis is on catalyst mechanism (e.g., dehydrogenation, deoxygenation, CNT growth, acid site analysis), rather than on generalizable plastic oil composition.
   - Data are heavily biased toward explaining catalyst function rather than characterizing the plastic’s intrinsic decomposition pattern.

4. Exotic or one-off catalysts with narrow scope
   - Custom nanocatalysts used in only one paper with 1–2 feed types, designed for a very specific transformation.
   - These are less useful for building a broadly generalizable fingerprint database.

5. No usable oil information
   - The study measures only gas yield, syngas composition, char yield, activation energies, TGA/DTG curves, etc., without reporting liquid/oil composition or at least meaningful oil yield data.
   - If oil is barely mentioned or clearly not a focus, treat as NOT suitable for inclusion.

Stage 2 decision:
- If Stage 1 passes but the study is not suitable for oil fingerprinting (matches any NEGATIVE criteria above), set:
  - "pyrolysis_related": "YES"
  - "include_in_oil_db": "NO"
- Only set "include_in_oil_db": "YES" when:
  - Stage 1 passes, AND
  - The study is clearly oil-centered AND
  - Oil composition or at least detailed liquid product data are clearly present or inferable, AND
  - The focus is plastics (not biomass/coal co-feeds, not hydrogen/CNT/aromatics-focused), AND
  - The data are likely useful as a fingerprint reference for plastic-to-oil and oil-to-plastic modeling.

When in doubt about Stage 2 (oil relevance or data usefulness), be conservative and answer "include_in_oil_db": "NO".

Title: A hybrid AI-kinetic framework for predicting the pyrolysis of food packaging plastic waste: Integrating TGA, model-free kinetics, and artificial neural networks
Abstract: The increase in the accumulation of plastic waste, such as polypropylene (PP) used in food packaging, causes serious environmental problems because of its non-biodegradable nature. The pyrolysis process is presented as an efficient thermochemical technique to convert such waste and other wastes into valuable products such as bio-gas, bio-oil, and biochar. Studying the degradation and kinetics of PP is crucial for process optimization and design. In the present study, both different kinetic models and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach were used to study and predict the PP pyrolysis behavior. The kinetic parameters were calculated using different model-free methods with Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data at different heating rates of 15, 30, and 60 °C/min. The activation energy results showed a range between 192.5 and 238.5 kJ/mol, depending on the calculation method used. The Vyazovkin method recorded the most stable values, with an average of 205.5 ± 8.1 kJ/mol, reflecting its reliability in representing the thermal decomposition mechanism of polypropylene. In parallel, the ANN model was developed to predict thermal degradation and other parameters. The ANN model was trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm with three hidden layers (20–20–10 neurons). The developed ANN model exhibited high prediction accuracy with RMSE values lower than 2.7 % and R2 greater than 0.96 at all heating rates. The predicted derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves affirm the ability of the ANN model to reproduce kinetics and degradation peak trends. The model could also predict the pyrolysis product yields at different temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 °C, indicating that a temperature of 500 °C at moderate heating rates is the optimum conditions to achieve the highest bio-oil yield. The integration of experimental TGA data with kinetic analysis and ANN modeling represents the key novelty of this study, presenting a hybrid and robust predictive approach to estimate the thermal degradation behavior of PP plastic waste, guiding the design of an effective scalable pyrolysis reactor used for sustainable valorization of plastic wastes.
