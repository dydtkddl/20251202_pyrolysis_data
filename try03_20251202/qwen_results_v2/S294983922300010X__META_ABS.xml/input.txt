Title: PVDC multilayer films: Chemical recycling by means of catalytic conversion into aromatics (BTX)
Abstract: In this study we evaluated the production of BTX aromatics out of a polyolefin-based 5-layer commercial film for food packaging where PVDC is included. Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of the polymer sample for the production of renewable benzene, toluene and xylenes (bio-BTX) has been performed. The experiment consisted of a controlled pyrolysis step followed by subsequent catalytic upgrading. Up to 23 wt% of BTX was produced out of the PVDC-containing multilayer polymer sample. The results obtained put in evidence that the overall BTX yield and the chemical composition of products generated by the composite film are similar with those based on pure PE. A study on the multilayer sample has been conducted by means of hyphenated technique (TGA-FTIR-MS), which describes the degradation steps during heating.
