Title: TG-FTIR-Py-GCMS analysis and catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of textile waste by red mud catalyst for liquid fuel production
Abstract: The substantial generation of textile waste (TW) and red mud (RM) has resulted in significant resource wastage and environmental challenges. Co-utilization technology of solid waste is an effective approach to improve waste utilization efficiency. In this study, RM catalytic pyrolysis experiments of TW were conducted using TG-FTIR and Py-GC–MS for liquid fuel production, and TW and RM were recycled simultaneously. At the optimal experimental conditions (temperature of 600 °C and feed catalyst ratio of 2:1), the tar yield and higher heating value (HHV) of TW pyrolysis catalyzed by RM were 73.43 wt% and 32.34 kJ/g, respectively. Additionally, experiments on the pyrolysis of various TW types revealed that LDPE and PP are suitable for tar production, while cotton, nylon, and PET are more suitable as feedstock for syngas production. The RM catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of textile waste is that Fe2O3 in RM exhibits significant catalytic activity in enhancing tar and syngas yields. However, during the catalytic process, Fe2O3 undergoes reduction to Fe3O4, resulting in diminished catalytic performance of the RM. After five cycles of use, the RM essentially lost its catalytic activity due to the accumulation of char and tar. All experimental findings of this study could offer an effective guideline for TW recycle and promoting RM utilization toward the waste-to-energy circular economy.
