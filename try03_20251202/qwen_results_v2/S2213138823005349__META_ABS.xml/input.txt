Title: Response surface methodology (RSM)-based pyrolysis process parameter optimization for char generation from municipal solid waste (MSW) in a fixed bed reactor
Abstract: Pyrolysis technology is a thermo-chemical process transforming any substance into valuable byproducts such as char, pyrolysis oil, and gas. The article outlines the production of char utilizing a fixed-bed reactor system to pyrolyze municipal solid waste (MSW) collected from a dumpsite in Guwahati City, India. Char (R1), pyrolysis oil (R2), and gas (R3) yield were used as the three responses in the pyrolysis experiment. Central Composite Design (CCD) recommended thirty pyrolysis experiment runs. According to CCD, the ideal pyrolysis conditions for a higher char yield were operating temperature of 250 °C, rate of heat of 10 °C/min, feed particle size of about 50 mm, and residence time of 180 mins. Under optimum conditions, the highest char yield was 72.62 %. A p-value of < 0.05 indicated that each process parameter was statistically significant. The operating temperature for pyrolysis was the most influential variable for achieving the highest char yield based on the F-value.
