Title: Kinetic and synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of peanut straw and plastic film
Abstract: Investigating the kinetics and synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics is an effective method to improve the economic revenue of recycling these wastes. This study calculated the kinetic parameters and analyzed the synergistic effects of peanut straw (PW) and plastic film (LDPE) at mixing ratios of 1:1, 1:4, 1:7, and 1:10 using model-free and model-fitting methods. The results indicate that the co-pyrolysis of PW and LDPE reduces the apparent activation energy required for the reaction, with the lowest value of 218 kJ·mol−1 at a PW to LDPE ratio of 1:7. Analysis of the pyrolysis products reveals that as the proportion of LDPE increases, the O/C ratio of PW and LDPE gradually decreases. At a PW to LDPE ratio of 1:7, the O/C ratio reduces to 0.09, resulting in a maximum oil yield of 76 %, 16.24 % higher than the theoretical yield. As the proportion of LDPE increases, the pyrolysis-induced softening of LDPE coats the PW, thereby weakening the synergistic effect. The experiments showed that the highest pyrolysis oil yield and the most substantial synergistic effect were achieved when the ratio of PW to LDPE was 1:7. Co-pyrolysis of PW and plastic film provides a viable approach for the efficient resource utilization of waste, facilitates the synergistic treatment of agricultural and plastic waste, and offers new theoretical foundations for sustainable material and energy production.
