Title: Improving bio-oil quality from low-density polyethylene pyrolysis: Effects of varying activation and pyrolysis parameters
Abstract: Activated carbons have recently emerged as renewable and efficient catalysts in converting low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable chemical and fuels, while the effects of various structure characters and operating conditions on the catalytic reactions of LDPE have not been well interpreted. Here, the renewable Chestnut shell is used to produce catalyst (CNSACC), then applied in catalytic pyrolysis process for the first time to conclude fatidic perception in the optimal process in improving jet fuel range aromatics and H2-enriched fuel gas. Activating reagent concentration and carbonization temperature play critical roles in the specific surface area and acidity, having optima conditions in obtaining target chemicals due to unique inherent structure of parent CNS. The catalytic temperature and catalyst loading also give rise to different catalytic performance. The results showed that the main compositions of attained bio-oil are belonged to jet fuel range hydrocarbons (up to 100%). The optimal selectivity of aromatics (95.88%) with a high content of H2 (65.37 vol%) could be achieved at a H3PO4/CNS ratio of 0.8, carbonization temperature of 850 °C, catalytic temperature of 550 °C and CNSACC/LDPE ratio of 1.0. This may provide fresh insight into fabricating catalyst from biomass, and give suggestions to upgradation of pyrolysis products.
