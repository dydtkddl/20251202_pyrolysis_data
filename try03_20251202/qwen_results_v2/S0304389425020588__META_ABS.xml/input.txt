Title: Advanced upcycling of spent electrolyte: Detoxification and selective alkene production via vacuum co-pyrolysis catalyzed by in-situ generated alkyl lithium-synergized ZSM-5
Abstract: The industrial recycling of spent electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries is severely overlooked due to low economic viability, leading to significant environmental pollution and resource waste. To simultaneously achieve green and high-value-added utilization, an advanced upcycling strategy is innovatively proposed. It involves the deep detoxification and selectively directional conversion to alkene of spent electrolyte through vacuum co-pyrolysis catalyzed by in-situ generated alkyl lithium-synergized ZSM-5. The feasibility of the detoxification and selective conversion of spent electrolyte has been first validated, followed by the optimization of temperature and pressure parameters. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the alkene yield in the pyrolysis gas can reache up to 81.16 % under the optimal conditions of 530 °C and an initial pressure of 100 Pa. Concurrently, fluorine/phosphorus/sulfur in spent electrolyte is immobilized in the form of inorganic minerals, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction of the pyrolysis residue, with the 96.30 %/97.29 %,/73.04 % detoxification rate ultimately. Based on mass spectrometry, the possible reaction mechanisms of synergistic vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis are proposed. It primarily includes the temperature-dependent regular bond cleavage of carbonates in spent electrolyte triggered by Li⁺, the deep detoxification and selective deoxidation conversion of the spent electrolyte into alkene, and the shape-selective effect resulted from steric hindrance.
