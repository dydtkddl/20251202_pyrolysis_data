Title: Integrating PET chemical recycling with pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste via pressureless alkaline depolymerization in a hydrocarbon solvent
Abstract: This study presents a proof of concept for a technology train that integrates polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recovery from mixed plastic waste and plastic pyrolysis. PET is depolymerized into terephthalic acid (TPA) by hydrolysis using a low volatility oil as medium, which enables (i) low-pressure operation, and (ii) a selective separation and recovery of TPA from the product mix by a simple process of filtration, washing, and precipitation. Full PET conversion and high TPA recovery (>98 %) were achieved at 260 °C. This technology train is demonstrated to be effective for processing mixed waste streams, leading to higher yield and quality of liquid product from thermal pyrolysis when compared with feedstock that has not been pre-treated. Further, the technology could be readily integrated with a plastics pyrolysis process, whereby a by-product from the pyrolysis could be used as the low-volatility oil.
