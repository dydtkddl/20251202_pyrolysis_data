Title: Emulsification of Water and Pyrolysis Oil
Abstract: Emulsification of pyrolysis oil produced from recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was experimentally investigated. Pyrolysis oil was made from recycled HDPE pellets using a pyrolyzer operated under cascade heating steps and heating rates. Water-in-oil emulsion was produced with ultrasonic mixer and homogenizer using Span80 surfactant as emulsifier. The emulsion stability was assessed by water droplet size and visual observation. Rheological properties were measured to confirm the microstructure change. The emulsion viscosity follows the Einstein equation for a dilute emulsion with water content less than 10%. The ultrasonic mixer was confirmed to be more effective than mechanical homogenizer both in term of smaller water droplet size and lower viscosity. Water-in-oil emulsion was more viscous than its constituting components. A proper droplet size minimization can mitigate the viscous emulsion issue.
