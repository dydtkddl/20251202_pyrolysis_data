Title: Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and paper in batch and tubular reactors for in-situ product improvement
Abstract: In this study, a mixture of waste plastics and papers were pyrolyzed under mild conditions in batch and tubular reactors. The decomposition reactions were enhanced by the use of synthetic zeolite-based catalysts to obtain a higher yield of volatiles and modifying the product composition. Especially the decomposition reactions and the product properties obtained from the different reactors were compared. Gases were analysed by GC-FID and GC-TCD. This fraction contains hydrogen, carbon-monoxide, carbon-dioxide and hydrocarbons. The pyrolysis oils have oxygen-containing compounds, such as alcohols, aldehyde, ketones, carboxylic acids or phenol and its derivative. Not only the reactor configurations but also the catalysts had an effect to the product properties, because the catalysts with alkali characters showed advanced behaviour in the reduction of oxygenated hydrocarbons, while high synthetic zeolite catalysts can increase the saturation and isomerization reactions. The long-term behaviour of the pyrolysis oils was followed by an accelerated aging test at 80 °C till 7 days. The catalysts can effectively reduce the rate of density and viscosity increase during the aging and the alkali catalysts showed beneficial properties in reducing the acidic components. In general, the aging properties were more favorable for pyrolysis oils obtained from the tubular reactor compared with the results in batch reactor.
