Title: An exploratory study of the processing of plastics, by means of pyrolysis, with the emphasis on PVC/aluminum combinations
Abstract: The feasibility of an alternative process for the processing of plastic/aluminum combinations by means of pyrolysis has been studied. Below the melting temperature of aluminum, the main fraction of the plastics can be devolatilized. As the plastic fraction often mainly consists of PVC, it is more economical to incinerate the pyrolysis products on-site, in combination with HCl removal and heat recovery. In the case of a high concentration of other plastics, e.g. ABS and PET, it is possible to get a valuable pyrolysis oil. Degradation of PVC mainly occurs through elimination of side groups, i.e. chlorine. 90% or more of this chlorine can be released as HCl. During pyrolysis of PVC, hardly any formation of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofuranes occurs. Depolymerization is the main degradation route of the styrene fraction in ABS (70 wt. %). Reactions of functional groups in the main chain take place during degradation of PET.
