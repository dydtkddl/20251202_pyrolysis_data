Title: Chemical recycling of cycloolefin-copolymers (COC) in a fluidized-bed reactor
Abstract: The pyrolysis of cycloolefin-copolymers (COC) in a fluidized-bed reactor was studied under various parameters like pyrolysis temperature, fluidizing gas or residence time. It was proven to reduce the undesired tar fraction to a minimum of around 10wt.% and to obtain up to 44wt.% valuable gases and 45wt.% aromatic light oils with a reactor temperature of 700°C. Furthermore, the mechanism of the pyrolytic degradation has been analyzed to determine if the comonomer 2-norbornene can be obtained by pyrolysis. In all experiments, only traces of around 0.05wt.% were detected. It was learned that 2-norbornene is not stable enough to resist drastic pyrolysis conditions; rather it undergoes a Retro–Diels–Alder reaction to form ethene and cyclopentadiene.
