Title: Effect of using zeolite as a catalyst on syngas produced from different wastes using pyrolysis technology
Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical process for converting organic waste into valuable products syngas, bio-oil, and biochar under oxygen-free conditions. Syngas, a combustible mixture rich in hydrogen (H 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), offers significant potential as a renewable energy carrier. This study investigates the catalytic effects of zeolite on syngas production from three distinct waste feedstocks: polyethylene (PE), olive pomace, and water hyacinth, using a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor (600 °C, 3 h residence time, N 2 atmosphere). Experiments were conducted with zeolite concentrations of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % (by weight) to assess its role in enhancing gas yield and quality. Results demonstrate that zeolite significantly improves syngas production by promoting cracking and deoxygenation reactions, leading to higher yields of H 2 and CO (key syngas components), reduced CO 2 and tar formation (undesirable byproducts), and feedstock-dependent performance, with polyethylene achieving the highest syngas yield (68 % at 30 % zeolite), followed by olive pomace (62 %) and water hyacinth (54 %). The study highlights zeolite’s effectiveness in optimizing waste-to-energy conversion, offering a sustainable solution for managing agricultural, plastic, and aquatic waste. These findings advance the development of efficient, scalable pyrolysis technologies and contribute to cleaner waste valorization strategies.
