Title: Ni/Nb2O5 as a noble-metal-free catalyst for the chemical upcycling of waste polyolefin plastics
Abstract: The resource utilization of waste polyolefin plastics is expected to be achieved through upgrading and reconstruction processes, but the primary scientific challenge lies in the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts. In this paper, we present Ni nanoparticles supported on Nb₂O₅ with tunable acid sites (Ni/Nb2O5-T) as noble-metal-free catalysts for the upcycling of waste plastics. These catalysts efficiently facilitate a one-pot, solvent-free catalytic hydrogenolysis of waste plastics, converting them into aromatic-free, highly branched alkane aviation fuels under mild conditions. Notably, the bifunctional Ni/Nb2O5-400 catalyst, characterized by highly dispersed metallic Ni sites and strong Brønsted acid sites, promotes key reactions such as hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, skeletal rearrangements, and β-scission of linear low-density polyethylene. This process achieves 100 % conversion with a yield of over 80 % for liquid products at 250 °C and 3 MPa H₂ for 4 h. The carbon distribution of the resulting liquid fuels primarily ranges from C6 to C18, with 71 % composed of isoparaffins, highlighting them as promising candidates for aviation fuels. Additionally, the Ni/Nb2O5-400 catalyst exhibits versatile activity, delivering high yields of highly branched alkane aviation fuels through the chemical upcycling of various types of waste polyolefin plastics. A techno-economic analysis further confirms that this Ni-catalyzed plastic-to-fuel process offers significant economic advantages, underscoring its potential for industrial-scale implementation.
