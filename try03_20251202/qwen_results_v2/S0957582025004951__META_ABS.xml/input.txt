Title: Thermal conversion of non-recyclable discarded fishing nets from the Gulf of Thailand for marketable resource recovery
Abstract: Discarded fishing gear, especially abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing nets (ALDFG), has become a major global problem due to its negative impact on the environment and economy. While efforts are underway to remove ALDFG from the ocean floor, many of these nets get contaminated with marine organisms and sediments, which complicates recycling. Consequently, they often end up in landfills. This study investigates the potential of thermal conversion of discarded fishing nets (DFNs) collected from the Gulf of Thailand for resource recovery. We analyzed the materials and thermal properties of four types of fishing nets such as K-island fishing net (KFN), L-island fishing net (LFN), M-island fishing net (MFN), and U-island fishing net (UFN) using FTIR and TGA. Additionally, pyrolysis experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 400 to 700°C using Py-GCMS. The results showed that polyamide nets (KFN, LFN, MFN) produced substantial yields of caprolactam, exceeding 74 % at 400°C and significantly reduced to 26–60 % at 700°C by thermal cleavage. Furthermore, difference selectivity of N-amide in pyrolyzed products of each fishing net related to netting patterns and presence of contaminants. In contrast, the polyethylene net (UFN) primarily generated alkanes and alkenes, highlighting distinct degradation pathways. Fast pyrolysis of polyamide nets yielded N-amides, particularly caprolactam, a valuable precursor for nylon production with significant market potential. Comparison with conventional caprolactam synthesized from cyclohexanone (66–98 % yield), pyrolysis fishing net could produce 64–86 % of alternative caprolactam. This approach provides an alternative to landfill disposal by converting non-recyclable fishing nets into useful feedstocks, thereby enhancing waste management strategies. Furthermore, the study aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11, 12, 13, and 14 by promoting resource recovery and addressing marine pollution. Future research should assess the carbon footprint of pyrolysis-derived caprolactam compared to traditional production methods, evaluating its role in sustainable manufacturing and low-carbon material recovery.
