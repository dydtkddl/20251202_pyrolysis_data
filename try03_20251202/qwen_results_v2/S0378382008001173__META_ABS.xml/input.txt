Title: The influence of the waste ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer on the thermal degradation of the waste polypropylene
Abstract: The pyrolysis of the waste polypropylene (PP), the waste ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and their blends has been carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C. The effect of different ratios of the waste EVA in the waste PP/EVA blends on the thermal degradation of the waste PP was investigated in terms of both product distributions and liquid fuel properties. The compositions of pyrolysis products were characterized in detail. The liquid products from the pyrolysis of the waste PP, the waste EVA and their blends were analyzed using different analytical techniques and fuel properties of pyrolytic liquids were investigated in comparison with commercial diesel. There were no synergistic effects between products from the waste PP and products from the waste EVA. While the ratio of the waste EVA increased in the waste PP/EVA blends, aromatic content of the pyrolytic liquids increased and subsequently paraffinic content of the pyrolytic liquids decreased. In addition, the boiling point distributions of pyrolytic liquids derived from the waste PP/EVA blends were found to be similar for all tested ratios of the waste PP/EVA blends.
