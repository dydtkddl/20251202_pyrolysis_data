Title: Reduction of Bromine Compounds in the Pyrolysis Oil of Computer Casing Plastics Using Shell, Ca(OH)2 and NaOH
Abstract: The acrylonitrile butadiene styrene “ABS” resin is used in a variety of exterior and chassis electrical products, it have been contained brominated flame retardants to prevent fire accidients. If the resin (ABS) was thermally decomposed, the bromine compound was mixed in the pyrolysis oil. In this work, the fraction of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene “ABS” containing brominated flame retardants was pyrolyzed by using a reflux-condenser apparatus installation at 450°C.And we used additives of sodium hydroxide “NaOH”, calcium hydroxide “Ca(OH)2” and scallop shell. The total bromine compounds in product oil could be reduced from 296mg/L to 27mg/L by NaOH.
