Title: An Aspen plus process simulation model for exploring the feasibility and profitability of pyrolysis process for plastic waste management
Abstract: Plastics, integral to various human activities, have led to a surge in production, posing substantial challenges in waste management. The persistent non-biodegradability of plastics, taking over a century to decompose, necessitates exploration into technologies for their conversion into sustainable fuels. Pyrolysis, an oxygen-free thermal decomposition process, emerges as a promising avenue for producing liquid fuels from plastic waste. This study's primary objective is to create and validate an Aspen Plus simulation model, enabling techno-economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis of pyrolysis for converting waste plastics into liquid fuels. Critical parameters—temperature, retention time, and particle size—are examined for their impact on product yield and quality. The methodology involves model development, validation, and subsequent simulations with various waste plastic types under different pyrolysis conditions. Experimental investigation using waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in an auger reactor yielded an oil yield of 61.29%, char yield of 10.98%, and syngas yield of 27.73% at 525 °C. Post-validation against this data, the model explored four plastic types, revealing significant influences of plastic type and reactor temperature on product yields. Polystyrene (PS) at 500 °C produced the highest oil content at 83.69%, with temperature affecting yield before secondary cracking. Techno-economic evaluation for a pyrolysis plant processing 10,000 tons of waste HDPE annually indicated a minimum selling price (MSP) of $302.50/ton, a net present value (NPV) of $12,594,659.7, and a 1.03-year payback period. This study provides crucial insights for designing an economically viable and sustainable pyrolysis process, guiding further research and industrial implementation.
