Title: Thermal degradation of polyethylene into fuel oil over silica–alumina by a continuous flow reactor
Abstract: A continuous flow reactor was operated at 420°C and feed rate of 0–1.5kgh−1 for catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) over SA-1 silica–alumina in order to investigate the effect of catalyst on the reaction rate and the quantity and quality of degradation products. SA-1 was either mixed with the PE inside reactor or placed in a catalyst cage, the efficiency being slightly higher in the first case. The catalyst did not have a significant effect on the reaction rates but the volatile products clearly had lower molecular weights. More gases were produced on SA-1 compared to thermal degradation, containing higher amounts of C4 and less amounts of C2 compounds.
