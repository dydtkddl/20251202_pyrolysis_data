Title: An innovative process for mass production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes by means of low-cost pyrolysis of polyolefins
Abstract: An innovative process for a mass production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by means of pyrolysis of virgin or recycled polyolefins is described. The technique uses solid–gas fluidised bed reactors, continuously operated under conditions which allow high heating rates of the polymers, high heat and material exchange coefficients and a reliable control of residence times in the reactor. The obtained MWCNTs have been characterized by TGA, SEM and TEM microscopy as well as X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the proposed process allows the production of MWCNTs compatible with most of the already known applications, in large quantities and at low cost. This makes extremely wider the field of possible applications of these nanostructured materials.
