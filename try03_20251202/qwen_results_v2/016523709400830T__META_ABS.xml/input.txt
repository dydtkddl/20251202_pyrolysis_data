Title: Olefins from polyolefins and mixed plastics by pyrolysis
Abstract: Mixed plastics collected from households were separated into a poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) poor light fraction (0.66 wt.% chlorine) and pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed reactor. The process was optimized to give high amounts of olefins. For comparison, high density polyethylene was used as feed material. The pyrolysis products contained about 36% ethene, 15% propene, 9% 1-butene and butadiene and an additional 15% pyrolysis gasoline. The olefins could be used again after separation as monomers for the production of polyolefins.
