Title: Microwave-driven upcycling of single-use plastics using zeolite catalyst
Abstract: The chemical upcycling of plastic represents an attractive approach of using plastic waste as feedstock in promoting the circular economy and decarbonizing the chemical industry. Here we report a one-step microwave-assisted heterogeneous catalysis approach for the deconstruction of plastic into valuable monomers. A high BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) yield of 44.7% was achieved using ZSM-5 catalyst at a low temperature of 300 °C under atmospheric pressure. The very nature of microwave initiation enhances the transformation of intermediates via the desirable cyclization/aromatization routes whilst preventing the random thermal cracking of plastic. This proof-of-concept heralds an exciting new era of applications for the responsible and sustainable recycling of waste plastic, in which plastic are efficiently converted back to high-value petrochemical products.
