Title: Co-pyrolysis of different torrefied Chinese herb residues and low-density polyethylene: Kinetic and products distribution
Abstract: In present work, the synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and torrefied Chinese herb residues (CHR) have been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. The kinetic parameters of co-pyrolysis were calculated by Coats-Redfern method, and the difference values of experiment and theoretical were also investigated for gas and oil compounds. The results show that the extent of synergistic or inhibitory effects of co-pyrolysis was connection with the severity of CHR torrefaction, and the activation energy depend on the blend ratio of LDPE and CHRs. In addition, co-pyrolysis tends to generate more small molecule products and reduce oil yield, and increase the CO content but decreases CH4 in the gas product. The results also found that the liquid products have a significant interaction during the co-pyrolysis process, because the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols in the blends pyrolysis oil has been greatly increased, and improving the quality of oil.
