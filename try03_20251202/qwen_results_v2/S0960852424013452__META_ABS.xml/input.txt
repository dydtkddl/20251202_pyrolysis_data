Title: Non-recyclable municipal solid waste characterization and pyrolysis for energy recovery
Abstract: European regulations require that by 2030 waste suitable for recycling, material recovery, or energy recovery will no longer be allowed to end up in landfills. Material composition in non-recyclable MSW bins dictates which valorization measures could be implemented. This study examines 32 non-recyclable MSW bins in the Getafe municipality (Spain). The bulk non-recyclable MSW bin is separated into 15 residue materials along with non-combustible materials. Merely 18.1 % of the non-recyclable MSW bins occupy non-recyclable waste. This indicates inadequate separation at source. MSW samples are grouped into six clusters with similar properties using the K-nearest neighbor methodology. Representative sample from each cluster is pyrolyzed at 520 °C. The main product of pyrolysis is liquid, which makes up 57.9 wt%, while solid and gas fractions are 16.4 and 16.5 wt%, respectively. Liquid fraction is a blend of aromatic, aliphatic, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds, while CO2 is the main gas compound.
