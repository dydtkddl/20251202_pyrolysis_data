Title: Upcycling WEEE plastics into dehalogenated and aromatics-rich oil by hydropyrolysis over Pd-supported catalysts
Abstract: This work explores low-pressure catalytic hydropyrolysis for upcycling plastics from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Three Pd-based catalysts (using Al2O3, n-ZSM-5, and SiO2 as supports) were investigated. Experiments were performed in a custom-made reactor operating at 550 °C / 350 °C in the thermal / catalytic zones, respectively, under 50 vol% H2/N2 as the carrier / reactive gas and at 6 bar. The main product was the oil fraction (yields over 65 wt%), having a high concentration of valuable aromatic hydrocarbons, coming mainly from ABS and PS polymers contained in the raw WEEE plastics. Among the three catalysts, Pd/SiO2 exhibited the best performance, sharply reducing the Cl content in the oil and achieving complete Br removal. A reference test with pure SiO2 indicated that the support alone possesses some halogen trapping capacity, although in quite lower extension than the Pd/SiO2 catalyst. The incorporation of Pd into the silica support enhanced both the oil dehalogenation and the conversion of oligomeric/heavy species, which is reflected in an increase in the GC-MS detected components. Therefore, these results denote that WEEE plastics hydropyrolysis over Pd/SiO2 catalyst is an effective treatment for the upgrading and dehalogenation of the so-produced oil fraction.
