Title: Carbon black preparation by partial oxidation of spent tyre pyrolysis oil – Influence of temperature, residence time and oxygen to feed ratio
Abstract: Preparation of carbon black (CB) by partial oxidation of the spent tyre pyrolysis oil (STPO) and its heavy residue fraction (HRF) was systematically studied using a lab-scale drop tube furnace. The effect of furnace operating temperature (T: 1100 to 1400 °C), residence time (tr : 5 to 60 s) and oxygen to feed ratio (O/F: 174 to 732) on the yield and quality of CB was examined using the response surface methodology (RSM). T was shown to have the most significant influence on CB yield and properties. While the CB yield was also influenced by tr , the quality was more sensitively dependent on T and O/F. The predicted optimal tr and O/F were approximately the same for both feedstocks (60 s and 174, respectively). However, T was higher for the HRF feedstock (1368 °C) than the STPO feedstock (1331 °C) due to the abundance of more viscous heavy hydrocarbons in HRF. Validation experiments under the aforementioned conditions demonstrated the models’ ability to predict responses accurately. The CB from both feedstocks had low contents of ash (<0.03%), volatiles (∼0.5%), sulphur (<0.7%), and high carbon (≥95%). The BET surface area and average primary particle size for CB from STPO and HRF were comparable to those of commercial CBs from fossil fuel feedstock. The CB from HRF had a higher carboxyl oxygen functional group (18%) compared to the CB from STPO (∼13%) and commercial CB (<5%).
