Title: Boosting aromatic production from pine sawdust and waste plastics co-pyrolysis via acidity tuning of HZSM-5
Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes represents an appealing approach to obtain value-added aromatics and contribute to resource utilization. Herein, the boost of HZSM-5 (HZ-5) catalyst acidity on aromatics in co-pyrolysis products of pine sawdust (PW) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was investigated. HZ-5 zeolites with varying b-axis lengths (B-HZ-5) and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were hydrothermally prepared, while metal-loaded HZ-5 zeolites (X/B-HZ-5, X = Pd, Zn, Ni, Fe, Mg) were synthesized by wet impregnation method to tune the acidity of zeolites. Results showed that B-HZ-5(2.5) achieved aromatics selectivity (96.98 %) and BTEX selectivity (59.41 %) when SiO2/Al2O3 ratio was 50, temperature was 550 ℃, and catalyst-to-feedstock ratio was 2: 1. The proportion of p-xylene in xylene was improved to 94.82 %. Zn/B-HZ-5(2.5) raised BTEX selectivity (74.48 %) and reduced polyaromatics (PAHs) selectivity (19.88 %). The characterization results manifested that urea reduced external Bronsted acid (B-acid) concentration of HZ-5 by changing its crystal size along the b-axis, inhibiting BTEX alkylation and MAHs polymerization on the outer surface of HZ-5. A lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio indicated more B-acid, enhancing aromatization activity. Incorporation of ZnOH+ interacted with external B-acid of B-HZ-5 to generate new Lewis acid (L-acid), which enhanced cyclization and dehydrogenation activity, inhibiting further aromatics oligomerization and reducing PAHs selectivity.
