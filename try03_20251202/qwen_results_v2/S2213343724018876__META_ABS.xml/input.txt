Title: Chromium-extracted aluminum catalyst for co-pyrolysis of cotton fabric waste and polypropylene plastic waste to bio-oil
Abstract: Heterogeneous catalysts of chromium-extracted aluminum (CE) were prepared and used to produce bio-oil from the co-pyrolysis of cotton fabric waste (CFW) and polypropylene waste (PPW). The catalysts were synthesized via wet impregnation at 5–20 wt% catalyst loading and calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. The co-pyrolysis was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C for 1 h with 1:1 CWF/PPW ratio and 1:1 catalyst/feedstock ratio. The physical and chemical properties of the catalysts and bio-oil were characterized by several techniques such as Brunauer–Emmet–Teller, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Investigations into the effects of metal loadings revealed that the 15CE catalyst was the most active, achieving a maximum bio-oil yield of 76.4 % and producing valuable chemical compounds like hydrocarbons, alcohols, phenols, and furans. The XRD of 15CE catalyst confirmed the presence of chromium oxide and assigned to the rhombohedral phase of the crystal lattice. BET indicated 15CE has the largest surface area (50.4 m2/g) among the CE catalysts which contributed to its high activity. The SEM revealed CE catalysts at different metal loadings contain irregular shapes and sizes with a rough surface texture. The NH3-TPD profiles indicated alterations in acid site distribution due to the interaction between the introduced Cr metal and EA. The 15CE catalyst also demonstrated significant reusability, maintaining performance after two regeneration cycles. These results confirm the potential of CE catalysts in enhancing bio-oil production from CFW and PPW.
