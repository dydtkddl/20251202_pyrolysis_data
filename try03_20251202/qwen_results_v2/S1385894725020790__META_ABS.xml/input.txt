Title: Fe/Co-Layered hydroxide-derived mixed metal oxides for efficient conversion of polystyrene to sustainable aviation fuel substitute components under CO2 mediation
Abstract: The use of plastic catalytic pyrolysis technology for producing aviation fuel substitute components holds broad application prospects in mitigating fossil resource depletion and environmental pollution. In this work, Fe/Co-layered hydroxide-derived mixed metal oxides (CoAl-LDO and FeCoAl-LDO) were prepared and used to catalyze the conversion of polystyrene into aviation fuel substitute components with rich-monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Compared with the CoAl-LDO, FeCoAl-LDO catalyst showed excellent catalytic conversion performance. Especially, the relative content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the liquid product reached 63.76% under CO2 mediation, which had an increase of 9.94% compared to the N2. The increase of FeCoAl-LDO mass ratio significantly promoted the generation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which reaches its maximum value of 73.32%. In terms of liquid components, the carbon number of aromatic components primarily falls within C7-C12, aligning with the usage range for aviation fuel substitute components. And, the proportion of light aromatic hydrocarbons reached 71.58%. This research highlights the promise of the FeCoAl-LDO catalyst in the production of aviation fuel substitute components under CO2 mediation, thereby providing vital support for the development of sustainable aviation fuel.
