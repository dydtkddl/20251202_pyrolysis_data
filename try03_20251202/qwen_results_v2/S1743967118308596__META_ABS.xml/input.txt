Title: Pyrolysis of chlorine contaminated municipal plastic waste: In-situ upgrading of pyrolysis oils by Ni/ZSM-5, Ni/SAPO-11, red mud and Ca(OH)2 containing catalysts
Abstract: This work is focussing to the thermo-catalytic batch pyrolysis of contaminated real municipal plastic waste using different catalyst mixtures in their different ratios: Ni/ZSM-5, red mud, Ca(OH)2 and Ni/SAPO-11, red mud, Ca(OH)2. The effect of the catalysts to the pyrolysis oil properties and the in-situ upgrading (especially the storage, transportation and corrosion stability) of pyrolysis oil was investigated. High concentration of Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/SAPO-11 zeolites in catalyst mixtures can increase the yield of gases and pyrolysis oil, the concentration of aromatics or the hydrogen content in gases; however the presence of red mud in higher content can further increase the hydrogen concentration. ZSM-5 based catalysts showed higher efficiency in aromatization reactions. An accelerated aging test at 80 °C till 1 week was performed to investigate the storage and transportation stability of pyrolysis oils. Only slight increase was found in the density and viscosity, on the other hand there was a bit greater increase using SAPO-11 based catalysts than ZSM-5. The change in the olefin content was followed via bromine number and FTIR spectra of pyrolysis oil, which resulted ∼3% and ∼4% decreasing using Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/SAPO-11 containing catalyst mixtures. Regarding acidic components, they significantly increased by aging time, while the high red mud and/or Ca(OH)2 in catalyst mixtures had notable benefit, because they can drastically decrease the concentration of chlorinated compounds, which led to less weight loss during corrosion test using copper plate till 60 days at 20 °C.
