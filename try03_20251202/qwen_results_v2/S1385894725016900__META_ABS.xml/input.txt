Title: Investigating the Role of Acid Sites in the Hydrocracking of Polyethylene-EVOH Multilayer Film Waste over Pt/BEA Catalyst
Abstract: Multilayer polymer films (MFs) containing poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH) and polyolefins are ubiquitous in single-use food and medical packaging. MFs are currently landfilled or incinerated rather than mechanically recycled because of the processing difficulties associated with their form factor and complex multicomponent structures. Advanced chemical recycling is a promising solution. Prior reports have explored hydrogenolysis and hydrodeoxygenation to convert EVOH, but these technologies are limited by catalyst deactivation and slow apparent kinetics, respectively. Alternatively, in this work, we demonstrate the efficient hydrocracking of commercial MFs into naphtha range (C5-C12) alkanes over platinum (Pt) supported on acidic zeolites. Mixtures of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and EVOH are utilized as MF surrogates to gain fundamental insights. Pt deposited on BEA supports with varying Lewis acid site (LAS) concentrations are synthesized and tested for hydrocracking. Surprisingly, Pt/BEA with high LAS concentrations demonstrates improved activity for LPDE/EVOH blends over LDPE alone. In contrast, LAS concentrations are shown to have no influence on LDPE hydrocracking. LAS and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) catalyze the dehydration of EVOH to form water, which improves LDPE hydrocracking. Polyaromatics formed primarily via EVOH thermal degradation lead to detrimental coke formation, which hinders hydrocracking activity. Reaction conditions and feed ratios of LDPE and EVOH are tuned to balance these competing effects. Reusability tests demonstrate that Pt/BEA maintains high activity (81% conversion in 2 h) and high selectivity towards naphtha (78%) over multiple reuse cycles. These findings position hydrocracking as a promising technology for the circularity of complex MF plastic waste.
