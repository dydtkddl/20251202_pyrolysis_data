Title: Fabrication of CeO2-supported catalysts for regulating CNTs synthesis from plastic wastes
Abstract: The recycling of plastic wastes is key to not only the development of circular economy, but also the safety of living environment. Herein, CeO2 support was prepared and used to fabricate Fe/CeO2 catalyst, which facilitated CNTs synthesis from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and real plastic wastes (RPW). The catalysts and carbon products were analyzed by XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, XPS, N2 physisorption, H2-TG, H2-TPR, TG-DSC and Raman. It was found that Fe/CeO2 catalyst effectively regulated CNTs growth under various operating conditions, obtaining (1) the uniform, regular, long and straight CNTs, (2) the high CNTs yield of 1090.0 mg/g or (3) the excellent crystallinity and graphitization degree of CNTs. Furthermore, Fe-based catalysts with commercial supports (CeO2(nm), Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2) were fabricated and used for CNTs synthesis from PE, which were taken as the reference to reveal the unique role of Fe/CeO2 catalyst in regulating CNTs synthesis. Compared with CeO2(nm), Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 supports, CeO2 support exhibited a smaller crystallite and particle size, enhanced the reducibility and improved the metal-support interaction, which was positive to the growth of long-straight CNTs. The unique role of Fe/CeO2 catalyst in regulating CNTs synthesis was inherent for different carbon sources including plastic wastes and hydrocarbons. This work may provide a new research direction for catalyst design and preparation towards fine-tuning the synthesis of CNTs from plastic wastes.
