Title: Effect of metal-free mesoporous silica incorporated ZSM-5 composite on thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene
Abstract: Although different zeolites impregnated with transition metals have been used in catalytic deconstruction of waste plastics to other products, the influence of hierarchical structures on conversion and product selectivity in plastic upcycling has not been thoroughly investigated. This research explores a transition metal free zeolite-based hierarchical composite, synthesized by incorporating SBA-15 in ZSM-5 framework, for efficient thermos-catalytic upcycling of polypropylene (PP). Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that ZSM-5@SBA-15 can break down PP at a significantly lower temperature, 240 °C, compared to that of pristine PP using ZSM-5 or SBA-15. In addition, pyrolysis of PP at 400 °C using ZSM-5@SBA-15 composite outperforms ZSM-5 or SBA-15 used separately and yields 90 % conversion with 70 % selectivity to propene. The presence of mesopores in the catalyst appears to reduce the diffusion resistance of intermediate products for successive scission, thereby reducing the activation energy of reaction and improving catalytic activity. The hierarchical composite ZSM-5@SBA-15 has significant potential for upcycling of PP into valuable monomers and lighter olefins, with lower energy demands, enhancing the economic feasibility of the process.
