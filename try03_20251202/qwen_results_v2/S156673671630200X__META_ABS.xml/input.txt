Title: CeO2 nanocatalysts for the chemical recycling of polycarbonate
Abstract: A novel catalytic property of CeO2 and its nanocrystals is discovered, and a simple chemical recycling technique for the conversion of poly(bisphenol A) carbonate (PC) to the contexture monomer (bisphenol A) under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of heterogeneous CeO2 catalyst using a batch reactor is proposed. The PC is completely depolymerized under these conditions in the presence of large CeO2 crystal with 75nm crystallite size at 200°C for 5h. When CeO2 nanocrystals approximately 7.4nm crystallite size are used, the catalyst amount, reaction temperature, and time required to completely depolymerize the PC are reduced compared with the experimental conditions using large crystal; the maximum monomer (bisphenol A) yield is approximately 90%. The depolymerization reaction of PC correlates directly with the surface-to-volume ratio. Further decomposition of the monomer is inhibited by reducing and/or controlling the amount of the catalyst, reaction temperature, and time.
