Title: Polyethylene conversion in supercritical water
Abstract: This paper describes pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) and n-hexadecane (nC16) in supercritical water (SCW). Batch reactions were conducted at temperatures ranging from 673 to 723K, at a reaction time of 30min, and water density between 0 and 0.42g/cm3. The pyrolysis rate of nC16 in SCW was almost the same as that in 0.1MPa argon (Ar) atmosphere. Product distribution was also more or less the same for both cases. PE pyrolysis results were clearly different from pyrolysis results in Ar. In SCW, higher yields of shorter chain hydrocarbons, higher 1-alkene/n-alkane ratio, and higher conversion were obtained. This difference of PE pyrolysis in SCW and in Ar could be explained by considering the difference in the reaction phase.
