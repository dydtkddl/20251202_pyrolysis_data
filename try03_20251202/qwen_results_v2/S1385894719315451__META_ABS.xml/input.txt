Title: Co-feeding effect of waste plastic films on the catalytic pyrolysis of Quercus variabilis over microporous HZSM-5 and HY catalysts
Abstract: The co-pyrolysis of Quercus variabilis (Q. variabilis) and waste plastic films (PFs) was investigated to evaluate the co-feeding effect of waste PFs to the pyrolysis of Q. variabilis. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that the second TG (DTG) peak temperature of waste PFs was decreased from 479 °C to 470 °C by applying its co-pyrolysis with Q. variabilis, suggesting the effective interaction between the pyrolysis intermediates of Q. variabilis and waste PFs. Pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis results showed that the typical pyrolyzates of Q. variabilis and waste PFs were not changed during for their thermal co-pyrolysis. In contrast, the catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of Q. variabilis and waste PFs in Py-GC/MS resulted in the additional aromatics formation, suggesting that the interaction between the pyrolysis intermediates of Q. variabilis and waste PFs over both HY and HZSM-5 leads to the enhanced formation of aromatics. Owing to the higher acidity and proper pore structure of HZSM-5, the CCP of Q. variabilis and waste PFs over HZSM-5 achieved higher aromatic and lower coke formation efficiency than that over HY.
