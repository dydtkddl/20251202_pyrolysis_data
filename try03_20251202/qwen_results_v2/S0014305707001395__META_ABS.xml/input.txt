Title: Chemical recycling of poly(methyl methacrylate) by pyrolysis. Potential use of the liquid fraction as a raw material for the reproduction of the polymer
Abstract: Pyrolysis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was studied as an effective way to recycle this polymer and recover its monomer methyl methacrylate (MMA). Experiments were carried out in a laboratory fixed bed reactor using either a model polymer or a commercial product based on PMMA as feedstock. Gaseous and liquid products obtained from polymer degradation were analysed and it was found that the oil fraction constituted mainly of the MMA monomer. Thus, the possibility of directly using the liquid product for the reproduction of the polymer was further investigated. Polymerizations accomplished in a differential scanning calorimeter using azo-bis-isobutyronitrile as initiator and different reaction temperatures. Results obtained were compared to corresponding data from polymerization of neat monomer. It was found that the pyrolysis liquid fraction can be polymerized and produce a polymer similar to the original PMMA. However, even small amounts of other organic compounds (mainly methyl esters) included in this fraction act as non-ideal reaction retarders, altering the reaction rate curve and lowering the glass transition temperature and the average molecular weight of the polymer produced.
