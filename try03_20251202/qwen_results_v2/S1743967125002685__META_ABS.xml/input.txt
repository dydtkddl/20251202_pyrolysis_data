Title: Co-pyrolysis behavior of low-rank coal and high-density polyethylene over ZSM-5 via in-situ Py-TOF-MS
Abstract: Catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-rank coal and waste plastic is a promising method to enhance the pyrolysis products quality. In this work, the materials of Hami coal (HM), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and ZSM-5 were selected to characterize the effect of catalyst on HM and HDPE co-pyrolysis characteristics, and the catalytic co-pyrolysis mechanism was explained via in-situ Py-TOF-MS. Results demonstrate that the hydrogen radicals generated by HDPE pyrolysis interact with HM char, which accelerates the secondary cracking of HM char to form aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, resulting in the yield of coal char decreasing. Meanwhile, the hydrogen radicals react with phenoxy radicals generated from coal pyrolysis to form phenolics, such as benzenediol (m/z = 110), methyl-benzenediol (m/z = 124), and methoxy benzenemethanol. For catalyst co-pyrolysis, the yield of C2-C4 significantly increased from 9.42 to 75.21 mg/g when the ZSM-5 catalyst addition increased to 30 %. Because the ZSM-5 has a rich pore structure and abundant acid sites and promotes secondary cracking of volatiles. Furthermore, the ZSM-5 enhances phenolic compound conversion into n-alkyl benzenes as the cleavage of the C-OH bond in phenolic compounds to form aromatic hydrocarbons. These results can guide the application of ZSM-5 in the coal and waste plastic co-pyrolysis and optimal tar production.
