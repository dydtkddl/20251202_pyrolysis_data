Title: Fermentation-pyrolysis of fibre waste from a paper recycling mill for the production of fuel products
Abstract: A range of energy fuels (ethanol, char, oil/wax and gas) was produced from fibre waste contaminated with plastic through the application of a fermentation-pyrolysis route. The fibre component was first converted to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), achieving an ethanol concentration of 39.8 g/L. The residue, enriched in lignin and plastics, was subjected to fast pyrolysis at temperatures between 350 and 550 °C. A wax product with a higher heating value (HHV) higher than 28 MJ/kg was obtained for temperatures higher than 450 °C, while values lower than 15 MJ/kg were observed for the oils produced from the untreated waste stream. Pyrolysis at 550 °C produced a wax with an HHV as high as 32.1 MJ/kg, where 51.8% of the energy content of the fermentation residue was transferred. The attractive energy contents of the pyrolysis products were enabled by oxygen removal from the feedstock during fermentation to ethanol.
