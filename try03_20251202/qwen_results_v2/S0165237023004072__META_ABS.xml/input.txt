Title: Optimization of influencing factors during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics with focus on monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content
Abstract: The thermal conversion of organic solid waste is a relatively economical and feasible method to obtain monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. In order to clarify the effect of different temperature, blend ratio and reaction time on the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics, and to seek the best experimental conditions, maize stalk and polystyrene plastic were used as raw materials to analyze the content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). At the same time, based on the Response Surface Methodology of Central Composite Design, a quadratic regression equation for the co-pyrolysis of maize stalk and polystyrene with focus on content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was established through the response surface optimization experiment of three factors and three levels. Variance analysis showed that the regression model was significant. The order of influencing factors from high to low on monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content was temperature, blend ratio of maize stalk to polystyrene, and reaction time. The optimal experimental conditions were temperature 600 ℃, blend ratio 1:3, reaction time 10.246 s, and the simulated content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was 68.99%. Based on actual situation, the optimum experimental conditions were temperature 600 ℃, blend ratio 1:3, reaction time 10 s, the theoretical and experimental content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were 68.31% and 65.68%, respectively. And the error among the simulated, theoretical, and experimental content is also within a reasonable range.
