Title: Assessment of process conditions in the dry reforming of HDPE fast pyrolysis volatiles for syngas production
Abstract: The joint valorization of CO2 and high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out by means of a two-stage process consisting of plastic fast pyrolysis and in-line dry reforming. The first step of pyrolysis was carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) by feeding plastics continuously and the volatiles formed were reformed in a second catalytic fluidized bed reactor (FBR), in which Ni commercial methane reforming catalyst has been used. The effect of reforming temperature (600–700 °C), space time (2–25 gcat min gHDPE −1) and CO2/C molar ratio (1−2) on the conversions of HDPE and CO2 has been analyzed. Furthermore, their influence on the yield of carbon containing products and H2 production has been analyzed. Thus, an increase in temperature and space time favors HDPE and CO2 conversion, reaching full HDPE pyrolysis volatiles conversion into gaseous products at temperatures above 650 °C, with a space time of 20 gcat min gHDPE −1 and CO2/C molar ratio of 1.5. Nevertheless, although an increase in CO2/C molar ratio enhances HDPE conversion, it also leads to CO2 conversion decrease due to excess CO2 in the feed. In fact, an increase in all variables above the values corresponding to full conversion of HDPE enhances the reverse Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, and therefore increases the conversion of CO2 to the detriment of H2 production. Thus, a maximum H2 production of 0.08 gH2 gHDPE −1 has been obtained at 650 °C with a space time of 25 gcat min gHDPE −1 and CO2/C molar ratio of 1.5, attaining a syngas production of 4.7 gsyngas gHDPE −1.
