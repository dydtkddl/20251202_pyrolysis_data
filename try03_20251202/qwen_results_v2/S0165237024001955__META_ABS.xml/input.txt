Title: Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and black liquor catalyzed by Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 for preparing high-quality bio-oil
Abstract: To solve the long-term environmental pollution caused by black liquor and waste plastics, and achieve high-value utilization, the method about co-pyrolysis of black liquid solid and waste plastics (Polypropylene, Polyethylene) catalyzed by Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 to prepare high-quality bio-oil is studied. The results found that hydrocarbons increased from 14.92% to 42.03% as Polyethylene was co-pyrolyzed with BLS, and hydrocarbons increased from 14.92% to 41.75% as Polypropylene was co-pyrolyzed with BLS, adding plastics can significantly improve the hydrocarbons yield of black liquor. Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 acts as a hydro deoxidizer in the pyrolysis of black liquid and waste plastics, the total hydrocarbons of black liquid solid, black liquid solid& Polypropylene, black liquid solid & Polyethylene increased by 6%, 78%, and 45%, respectively. An appropriate increase of pyrolysis temperature can promote the co-pyrolysis of BLS with PP, and BLS with PE, and can increase the yield of hydrocarbons. Compared with black liquor’s pyrolysis, the yield of hydrocarbons can be increased by 59.65% and 24.52% as Polyethylene or Polypropylene is adapted to pyrolysis with black liquid solid, respectively, the high-quality bio-oil is obtained because of a large number of hydrocarbons and high hydrogen content.
