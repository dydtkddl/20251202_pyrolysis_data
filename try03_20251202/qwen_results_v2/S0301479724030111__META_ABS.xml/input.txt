Title: Applications of H2-Enriched syngas and slag products from plastic wastes via novel plasma dual-stage-arc pyrolysis
Abstract: Sustainable plastic waste management in the prevailing ‘new-normal’ post-pandemic scenario calls for calorific waste plastic up-cycling into high-end product recovery pathways. The present work employed a novel dual-stage arc plasma pyrolysis reactor to recover syngas and slag products from mixed plastics and Low-Density Polyethylene and Polyethylene Terephthalate (LDPE-PET) plastic waste feeds. Syngas product yield decreased while the solid slag yield increased with rising arc current, attaining 75% and 25% for mixed plastic waste feed and 59% and 41% for LDPE-PET wastes, respectively, at 200A arc current. The resultant syngas composition showed 83% and 77% H2 while 1.7% and 2.7% CO for mixed plastic waste-feed and LDPE-PET wastes, respectively, with no significant presence of CO2. Slag characterization studies revealed the presence of scattered pores on the slag surface, graphitic nanostructures due to scraped carbon depositions from electrode tips and the absence of aromatic groups due to complete conversion. High carbon content was observed in the slag due to the dissociation of lighter hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide on dual-arc exposure in two stages, underscoring the higher efficiency. For holistic integrated circular onsite ‘plastic waste-to-resource’ recovery-cum-application, electricity was generated from the resultant syngas and the slag was used for the manufacture of tiles in the community platform. Techno-economic evaluation of an up-scaled plasma pyrolysis facility shows the power recovery of 3.5 kWh/kg of waste plastic, with a net annual profit of $2800 and a payback period of 1.7 years. The findings of the present work suggest that the proposed integrated dual-arc plasma pyrolysis based plastic waste-to-resource recovery in circular-economy model has a viable outcome.
