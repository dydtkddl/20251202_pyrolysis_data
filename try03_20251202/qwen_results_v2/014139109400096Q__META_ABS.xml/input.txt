Title: Thermolysis of polyethylene
Abstract: The thermal degradation (or thermolysis) of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) was studied at moderate temperatures, 425–450 °C, under an inert atmosphere. One potential application for the products of polyethylene thermolysis is in the production of synthetic lubricants. For such an application, the product should be close to 1 decene in chain length and molecular structure. The major reaction product obtained from thermolysis, at a reaction temperature of 450 °C, was a liquid at room temperature with a yield of 82.5% of the initial charge to the reactor. The balance of the reaction products was in two parts: a residue and a non-condensable gas fraction, with yields of 9.5 and 8.0%, respectively. The liquid and residue fractions were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and gas chromatography. The liquid fraction had an average chain length of 13.6 carbons and a maximum total unsaturation of 70.8 mol%. The rate of liquid production with time was investigated and compared with theoretical predictions.
