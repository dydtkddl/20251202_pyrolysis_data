Title: Characterization of Products from the Pyrolysis of Municipal Solid Waste
Abstract: Pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the form of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) was performed in a fixed bed reactor to recover char, oil/wax and combustible gases. It was established that the yield and composition of the products recovered depended on temperature; the percentage yield of char fell as the pyrolysis temperature was raised from 400°C to 700°C, whereas that of oil/wax and gaseous products rose. The chars recovered were also found to have properties which depended on the size fraction analysed. The gaseous product evolved during the pyrolysis had a high calorific value, making the gases suitable for use as a fuel. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-ir) of the derived oils, indicated that they were chemically very complex and highly oxygenated, and have the potential of being used either as a petrochemical feedstock or as a substitute liquid fuel.
