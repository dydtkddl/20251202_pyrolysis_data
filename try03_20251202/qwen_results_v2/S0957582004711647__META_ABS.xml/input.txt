Title: Kinetic Model of the Chemical Recycling of Waste Polyethylene into Fuels
Abstract: Tertiary recycling methods offer potential possibilities for the utilization of waste plastics. Thermal and catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene wastes were studied in a batch reactor under mild cracking conditions to derive liquid cracking products of olefins and paraffins. Zeolite catalysts with different activities were studied: a commercial equilibrium FCC catalyst, an H form ZSM-5 catalyst, and a natural clinoptilolite containing rhyolite tuff. The catalytic processes could convert waste polymers into valuable hydrocarbons. The properties of products could be modified by the use of catalysts. The olefin content and the position of the olefinic double bonds were investigated with IR spectrometry. In the presence of catalysts the olefin content increased, and the terminal bonds migrated into internal positions. Furthermore the liquid products had lower average molecular weights than those obtained without catalysts. The activation energies of the cracking reactions with or without catalysts were determined. The apparent activation energy was lower in catalytic than that in thermal degradation. The cracking reaction rates were modelled and the reaction rate constant of each hydrocarbon type was calculated. The model gives a good approximation of the experimental results obtained from the degradation of LDPE waste in the presence and absence of catalysts. Under the studied parameters, liquids were formed with suitable properties for further uses (e.g. low sulphur content, low pour point).
