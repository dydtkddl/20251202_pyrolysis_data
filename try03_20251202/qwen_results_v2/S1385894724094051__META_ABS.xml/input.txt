Title: Enhancement of hydrogen production from thermal and catalytic cracking of HDPE through Implementation of activated biochar
Abstract: This study investigated hydrogen production characteristics from thermal and catalytic cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and role of activated biochar derived from biomass (palm kernel shell, PKS). The objective was to enhance hydrogen yield in response to growing demands for hydrogen and the management of waste plastic. Three experimental setups—pyrolysis, thermal cracking, and char cracking—were employed in a two-stage pyrolysis system to examine the impact of reaction temperature and activated biochar on 1) the decomposition of HDPE into tar, which is a complex hydrocarbon mixture, and 2) the production of hydrogen from the vaporized tar. The findings indicated that the reaction temperature in the first reactor influenced tar vapor formation, whereas the temperature in the second reactor was more closely associated with the production of hydrogen and lighter hydrocarbons such as methane. Under identical temperature conditions, the use of activated biochar increased the hydrogen production by more than six times and adsorbed the solid carbon, resulting in no visible carbon particles. Although the reaction temperatures in this study were higher than those in previous studies involving other catalysts, leading to increased energy costs, the abundant biomass sources for carbon activation and the simplicity of the manufacturing process could position activated biochar as a viable catalyst for the thermochemical recycling of plastic into energy source.
