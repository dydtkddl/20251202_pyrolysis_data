Title: Liquefaction of municipal waste plastics in VGO over acidic and non-acidic catalysts☆
Abstract: Co-processing of municipal waste plastics (MWP) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) over HZSM-5, DHC-8 (commercial silica–alumina catalyst) and cobalt loaded active carbon catalyst has been comparatively studied. Co-processing experiments were carried out under hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures between 425 and 450°C. The composition, sulphur and chlorine amount of liquid products were determined. The product distribution and the composition of liquids were changed depending upon the temperature and the catalyst type. As expected temperature led to increase in cracking activity of catalysts. DHC-8 and HZSM-5 showed substantially different activities in co-processing due to the difference in their acidity. HZSM-5 gave highest gas yield at all temperatures and highest liquid yield (38.3) at low temperature. Although Co-AC was a neutral catalyst, it showed the cracking activity as well as HZSM-5 and more than DHC-8. No chlorine compound was observed in liquid products. The sulphur amount in liquid products varied with the catalyst type. Although HZSM-5 showed good cracking activity at low temperatures, it gave the liquid product containing highest sulphur amount. By considering both the quantity and quality of liquid fuel obtained from co-processing, it may be concluded that Co-AC gave the best result in the co-processing of the MWP/VGO blend. To observe the effect of metal type loaded on active carbon on catalyst activity, a series of co-processing experiments was also carried out.
