Title: Kinetics, thermodynamics and rate equations of co-pyrolysis of Polyalthia Longifolia leaves and polypropylene grocery bags
Abstract: The kinetics and thermodynamics of co-pyrolysis of Polyalthia longifolia leaves (PL) and polypropylene grocery bags (PP) were developed through thermogravimetric analyses at four different heating rates. Differential thermogravimetric curves were deconvoluted into three pseudo-components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and a combined lignin-PP) using Fraser-Suzuki function. Activation energies for pyrolysis of each pseudo-component were determined using five isoconversional methods, yielding averages of 162.24–183.11 kJ/mol (hemicellulose), 166.45–198.42 kJ/mol (cellulose), and 204.08–219.67 kJ/mol (lignin & PP). Differential Friedman method indicated a positive synergistic effect, highlighting enhanced interactions between PL and PP. Thermodynamic analysis showed that external energy is required to form active complexes for all components. Criado's method suggested a complex reaction mechanism, while master plots based on integral form of kinetic data revealed that hemicellulose, lignin, and PP thermal degradation followed A2 model, with cellulose degradation following both A2 and A3 models. This study further developed rate equations for single and co-feed pyrolysis of PL and PP, providing valuable insights for process optimization.
