Title: Enhanced production of aromatics-rich fuel oil from low-density polyethylene waste via pyrolysis with N-doped activated carbon catalyst
Abstract: Polyethylene waste poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and human health. This study investigates the effect of N-doped activated carbon catalyst (NACC) in producing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHCs) via ex-situ pyrolysis of waste low-density polyethylene and elucidates the underlying reaction mechanism. NACC, synthesized from urea and coconut shell powder, demonstrated excellent catalytic performance. N-doping introduced Lewis base functional groups, such as pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N, on the catalyst surface. These Lewis base sites facilitated the cracking of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and promoted aromatization reactions. The COOH and phenolic O–H groups on the catalyst surface acted as H+ donors, facilitating deoxygenation and cyclization reactions. NACC promoted the desired reaction pathways, increasing MAHC content (16.99 % to 63.77 %) and oil yield (by ∼47 %), while reducing wax (24.5 % to 3.3 %) and olefin content (43.48 % to 15.05 %). High-octane MAHCs such as m-xylene, o-xylene, and trimethylbenzene were produced in notable quantities. NACC has the potential to be a renewable and cost-effective alternative to zeolite-based catalysts for converting waste plastics into high-octane fuel precursors and industrial aromatics to reduce dependence on fossil-derived resources.
