Title: Biochar-enhanced induced heating promotes efficient hydrogen production from plastic
Abstract: The low recycling efficiency and environmental impact of plastic waste highlight the urgent need for scalable, low-carbon valorization strategies. This study proposes an induction heating (IH)-assisted pyrolysis–reforming system using sugarcane bagasse derived biochar (BCx, x = 500–800 °C) for hydrogen-rich gas production. Under optimized conditions (pyrolysis at 700 °C, reforming at 800 °C, HDPE:BC = 1:2), BC800 achieved a peak hydrogen yield of 3978.8 mL/g, compared to 2828.0 mL/g under conventional heating (CH), while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by 36 %. Structural characterization confirmed that IH promotes graphitization, preserves porosity, and suppresses amorphous carbon. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and finite element simulations revealed electromagnetic field–induced electron enrichment and improved charge transfer on the biochar surface. In situ infrared gas monitoring further confirmed enhanced hydrogen generation kinetics under IH. Moreover, the IH-BC system demonstrated broad applicability across common plastics, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with hydrogen yield improvements ranging from 26.5 % to 88.7 % compared to CH. These results underscore the synergistic effects of magnetic induction and biochar structure in driving efficient plastic reforming. This work offers a practical pathway for plastic upcycling and advances the design of magnetically assisted catalytic systems for clean hydrogen production.
