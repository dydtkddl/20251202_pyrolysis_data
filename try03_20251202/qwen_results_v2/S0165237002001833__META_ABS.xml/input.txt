Title: Studies on thermal degradation of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS-Br) containing brominated flame retardant
Abstract: The thermal degradation of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS-Br; 10 g) containing brominated flame retardant (Br: 9.59 wt.%) was carried out at 450°C using a semi batch operation using two different temperature programs. The heating rate was found to affect the quality of the degradation oil and yield of products (liquid, gas and residue). Data on the effect of the temperature program on the accumulation of liquid products was presented. It was found that the majority of the bromine was concentrated in the carbon residue and while majority of the nitrogen accumulates in the liquid products irrespective of degradation mode. The use of a one step constant heating rate process (I) produced a higher liquid yield (39%), than a two step process (29%). Differences were also noted in the Br and N contained in the liquids produced by the two processes.
