Title: Pyrolysis of multilayered plastic packets to hydrocarbon fuel feedstock: Thermal degradation behaviour, kinetics and thermodynamic analysis, and semi-batch studies
Abstract: This study examines the kinetics and batch pyrolysis behavior of multilayered waste milk packets to optimize their conversion into valuable products. Using thermogravimetric analysis at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min and employing the model fitting and model-free methods such as the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), and Kissinger methods, the process was found to follow an F1 order-based mechanism with an activation energy of 304 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor of 2.60 × 1012 min.−1 The maximum weight loss (97.2 %) occurs at 5 °C/min. The average changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy are 814.939 kJ/mol, 135.698 kJ/mol, and −903.846 × 10−3 kJK−1mol−1 respectively. At 450 °C, the maximum pyrolytic oil yield reaches 66.92 %, with FTIR analysis confirming the presence of diverse hydrocarbon components such as alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons etc. in the oil. Kinetic triplet and thermodynamic parameter data, alongside physical and chemical analyses, suggest that the pyrolytic oil from multilayered waste milk packets could serve as a superior substitute for petrochemical fuel oil.
