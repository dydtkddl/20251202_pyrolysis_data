Title: Enhancing the combustion characteristics of plastic pyrolytic oils by doping nanocarbon additives for alternative energy
Abstract: This study focuses on enhancing the combustion properties of plastic pyrolytic oil blends (LDPE and PP) by incorporating nanocarbons (fullerene and graphene). Single-droplet measurements were conducted with nanocarbon concentrations of 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L, blended with or without LDPE and PP. The experimental setup included a K-type thermocouple for temperature measurement and a CCD camera to observe droplet evolution in an atmospheric chamber. The results indicate that neat LDPE exhibited a faster evaporation rate and a shorter droplet lifetime compared to neat PP. The addition of nanocarbons to pyrolytic oils enhanced evaporation performance by a factor of two. Droplet fluctuations in nanocarbon-blended fuel significantly shortened the transient heating phase of pure pyrolytic oils. Furthermore, nanocarbon loading reduced the ignition delay by more than 30 %. A higher nanocarbon concentration (5 mg/L) in LDPE reduced the ignition delay by up to 10 %, whereas a lower concentration (1 mg/L) in PP was sufficient to achieve a similar reduction. Among the tested samples, LDPE-g1 exhibited the highest combustion rate, followed by PP-f1. The study found that graphene was the most effective additive for LDPE, while fullerene performed best with PP. Lastly, LDPE-g1 demonstrated evaporation performance comparable to petrol-diesel.
