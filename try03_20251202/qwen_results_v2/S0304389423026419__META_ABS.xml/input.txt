Title: Simultaneous removal of brominated and chlorinated species during the production of oils by e-waste plastics catalytic hydropyrolysis
Abstract: The production of added-value chemicals via pyrolysis of plastic wastes, such as those from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), needs addressing their usual contamination with halogens (mainly Br and Cl). This work compares the conversion via pyrolysis and hydropyrolysis of a real WEEE plastic, having a complex composition, in two different reactor configurations: down-flow (DF) and up-flow (UF). Likewise, the effects of incorporating a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and using two different pressures (1 and 6 bar) have been assessed. With the DF mode, pyrolysis at 1 bar leads to an oil yield above 80 wt% and a total halogen content of about 600 ppm (vs 1600 ppm in the water-washed WEEE plastic). Under DF catalytic hydropyrolysis at 6 bar, this high oil yield is maintained while its dehalogenation degree is improved (142 ppm). Operating with the up-flow configuration, under 6 bar and H2 presence, leads to some reduction in the oil yield (about 70 wt%) but significantly decreases the oil halogen content (55 ppm Cl and total elimination of Br). These results have been related to the slower pyrolysis and longer residence time in the thermal zone of the UF configuration, which favours the halogen-trapping effect of the char fraction, and the pressure-enhanced hydrodehalogenation activity of the catalyst. This study highlights the environmental benefits of the proposed process, emphasizing the lower halogen content in the resulting oils and promoting a more sustainable approach to plastic waste valorisation.
