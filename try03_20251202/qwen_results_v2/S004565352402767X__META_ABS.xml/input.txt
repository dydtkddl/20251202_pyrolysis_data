Title: Thermochemical processing for the sustainable disposal of spent filter waste
Abstract: High-efficiency particulate air filters are widely used for indoor air purification. Spent filter waste (SFW), which can trap infectious and toxic substances, is primarily treated via incineration. This method causes environmental concerns, particularly regarding the generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants. To cope with these issues, this work proposes the pyrolysis of SFW using CO2 as a sustainable alternative to conventional incineration. The introduction of CO2 enhanced reactivity during pyrolysis, potentially offering a more sustainable process. The SFW consisted of filtered particles and two distinct filter/support layers, and the presence of toxic chemicals and primary polymer constituents was characterized. While CO2 had a minimal impact on enhancing syngas production, owing to its slow reaction rate during SFW pyrolysis, adding a nickel-based catalyst significantly improved CO2 reactivity. This resulted in a 649.7% increase in carbon monoxide (CO) production compared to that in pyrolysis under N2. The potential of this pyrolysis system for reducing CO2 emissions was evaluated against that of conventional incineration. Overall, this study presents a promising method for the pyrolytic conversion of SFW into combustible gases, particularly CO, while leveraging CO2 utilisation to mitigate global warming.
