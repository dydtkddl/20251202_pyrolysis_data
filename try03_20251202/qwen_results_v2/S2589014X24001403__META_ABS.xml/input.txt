Title: Catalytic co-pyrolysis behaviour and kinetics study of waste lignocellulosic non-edible seeds and Covid-19 plastic over Al2O3 catalyst
Abstract: The current research centred on estimating kinetic parameters and examining the composition of pyrolysis vapours from neem seeds and COVID-19 waste nitrile gloves (NG) using Pyro-GC–MS. Owing to the intricacy of the co-pyrolysis process, kinetic parameters were studied using KAS, OFW, FM, and VZ models. Biomass and plastic were mixed in different proportions (1:1, 3:1, and 5:1), whereas feed to catalyst was mixed at 3:1, 5:1 and 8:1, respectively. The estimation of the kinetic parameters of co-pyrolysis of NMS and NG confirmed that the 3:1 ratio and the feeds-to-catalyst ratio at 5:1 were found to be most effective in producing maximum hot vapours. Moreover, the analysis of pyrolysis vapours confirmed that a ratio of 3:1 for (NMS to NG) and a ratio of 5:1 for feed to catalyst (NMS + NG(3:1) + Al2O3 (5:1) resulted in the highest production of hydrocarbons while decreasing the presence of acids and oxygenated compounds.
