Title: Production of valuable hydrocarbons by catalytic degradation of a mixture of post-consumer plastic waste in a fluidized-bed reactor
Abstract: A mixture of post-consumer plastic waste (PE/PP/PS/PVC) was pyrolyzed over various catalysts using a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process operating isothermally at ambient pressure. Experiments with various catalysts gave good yields of valuable hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions. A model based on kinetic and mechanistic schemes for the observed products associated with chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation has been developed. The model gives a good representation of experimental results. It is also an improvement on the currently available empirical “lumping” techniques which are usually severely restricted in terms of product definitions. Additionally, this model represents the benefits of product selectivity for the chemical composition in relation to the effect of structurally different catalyst types, and the performance of the reaction temperature used as well as the particle size of the catalyst selected.
