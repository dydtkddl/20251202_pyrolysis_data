Title: Enhancing pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue through torrefaction: Interactions among typical components
Abstract: Enhancing the pyrolysis of Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) through torrefaction effectively removes impurities, preventing equipment corrosion and improving product quality. ASR, mainly composed of plastics, rubber, foam, and fabric in varying ratios, exhibits torrefaction and pyrolysis behaviours influenced by complex interactions among these components, which contribute to process outcomes that exceed the additive effects of individual components. To further elucidate the interaction mechanisms during the integrated torrefaction and pyrolysis process of ASR, this study analyzed the product properties of ASR with varying component ratios during this process. Our findings reveal that the interactions among the typical components of ASR enhance reactions between volatiles and char, boosting the polymerization of volatiles into char. This interaction increased char yield by over 6.0 wt% compared to the sum of individual components and enhanced the formation of large aromatic structures within the char. The melting of plastics over semi-char caused continuous volatile accumulation, further boosting polymerization, while foam’s porous structure enhanced volatile-char contact, promoting this process. Conversely, rubber and fabric produced more char and oxygen-containing radicals, promoting the secondary polymerization of volatiles. This resulted in char with higher molecular weight and a 50% increase in heteroatom content within the oil fraction.
