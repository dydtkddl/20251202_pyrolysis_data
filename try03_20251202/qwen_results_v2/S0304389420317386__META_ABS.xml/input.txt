Title: Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards, and migration and distribution of bromine
Abstract: Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB) was performed to investigate the characteristics of pyrolysis product and Br fixation. Pyrolysis conversion increased with increasing temperature, reaching 93.3 % at 650 °C. However, increasing heating time did not exhibit remarkable influence on pyrolysis conversion. At 350 °C, phenols were main compounds in the oil accounting for 91.15 %. As the temperature increased to 650 °C, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (except phenols) increased to 20.55 % and 19.03 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the total content of CO2, CO, CH4 and H2 in the non-condensable gases increased significantly. Addition of ZSM-5 and kaolin promoted the recombination reaction of pyrolysis products, increased the relative percentage of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (except phenols) and C11-C20 compounds in the oil, and reduced non-condensable gases. The oxygen bomb-ion chromatography was used to evaluate the Br content of pyrolysis residues. Higher pyrolysis temperature enhanced transfer of Br to pyrolysis gas. K2CO3, Na2CO3 and NaOH reacted with hydrogen bromide to generate KBr and NaBr, which significantly improved the Br fixation efficiency of pyrolysis residues (i.e. from 29.11%–99.80%, 96.39 % and 86.69 %, respectively) and reduced Br content in pyrolysis gas.
