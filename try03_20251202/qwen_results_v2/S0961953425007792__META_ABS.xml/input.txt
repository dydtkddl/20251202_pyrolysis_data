Title: Study on the synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis between chicken manure biogas residue and low-density polyethylene
Abstract: The synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis between chicken manure biogas residue (CMBR) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was revealed. The weight loss and kinetics during co-pyrolysis were characterized using a synchronous thermal analyzer. The effects of mixing ratio and pyrolysis temperature on the characteristics of the three-phase products of co-pyrolysis were analyzed using a tube furnace. The results demonstrated an increase in mass loss rate (M f) and comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) and a reduction in activation energy compared to theoretical calculations, confirming the presence of synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis between the two materials. Positive synergistic effect was the most pronounced at the mixing ratio of 1:1. Co-pyrolysis inhibited bio-oil production and reduced the O/C ratio of bio-oil; it also precipitated the release of pyrolysis gas and increased the yields of CH4 and hydrocarbon gas (CnHm). Co-pyrolysis reduced the content of nitrogenated organic compounds in bio-char, enhanced its aromaticity and altered the pore structure on the bio-char surface. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, co-pyrolysis bio-oil further transformed into small-molecule gases, leading to an increase in the yields of CO and H2.
