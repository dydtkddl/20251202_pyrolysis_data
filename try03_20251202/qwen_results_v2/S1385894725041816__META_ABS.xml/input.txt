Title: Primary products from kinetic-limited high-density polyethylene pyrolysis at near vacuum
Abstract: Pyrolysis offers a sustainable pathway to recycle plastic waste, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a widely used thermoplastic. However, product distributions from HDPE pyrolysis often vary, even from the experiments conducted at the same temperature and time, highlighting the complex interplay between chemical kinetics and mass transfer. This study investigates HDPE pyrolysis at control pressures at or below 1 atm and temperatures at 500 and 550 °C using a microreactor. The effects of reaction pressure on product formation and escape were examined. Our experiments demonstrated that near-vacuum conditions would give a product distribution closer to that obtained from the kinetic-limited regime representing primary products, where secondary decomposition reactions in the melt and headspace are minimized. In contrast, increasing pressure promotes the formation of lighter hydrocarbons through continued decomposition of the oligomers in the melt phase and of gaseous products in the headspace directly above the vapor–liquid interface, where the latter was found more dominant under our reaction conditions. A Damköhler number analysis quantifies the competition between a species’ mass transfer and its further pyrolysis, showing that at low pressures, volatile products escape rapidly without further pyrolysis, whereas higher pressures decelerate outflow in the headspace, enabling continued decomposition. This work identifies pressure-dependent product cutoffs and provides insights into optimizing pyrolysis conditions for desired product distributions. The findings serve as a framework to advance pyrolysis technologies, facilitating plastic recycling and upcycling to achieve full circularity.
