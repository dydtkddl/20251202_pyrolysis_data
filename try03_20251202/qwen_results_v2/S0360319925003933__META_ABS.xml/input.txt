Title: Efficient production of hydrogen-rich syngas by pyrolysis coupled with catalytic steam reforming of degradable polylactic acid waste plastics over high-entropy oxide catalyst
Abstract: To mitigate the solid waste crisis, converting waste plastics into valuable products through thermochemical processes, such as through pyrolysis, is emerging. Polylactic acid (PLA) plastics are difficult to separate from other plastics in solid waste, and mixed waste is usually directly landfilled or incinerated. Moreover, studies focused solely on the pyrolysis of PLA plastic remain relatively scarce. The large amount of tar produced during plastic pyrolysis can reduce the high-value production of hydrogen, and high-entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst exhibit excellent performance in tar conversion and anti-carbon deposition. In this research, HEO catalyst was synthesized by the sol-gel method for the pyrolysis of waste PLA plastic volatiles, aiming to generate H2-rich syngas in a two-stage integrated reactor system. During catalytic reforming, the highest hydrogen production was 124.1 mmol∙gPLA −1, and the gas yield based on plastic mass reached 259.8 wt%. The superiority of HEO catalyst stems from the synergistic interaction of various elements, enhancing the structural stability of the high-entropy system and increasing oxygen vacancies, resulting in strong C–C and C–H bond-breaking capabilities in the Ce, Mg, Fe, Co, and Ni HEO catalyst. In addition, this study investigated the mechanism of PLA’s simple pyrolysis and the role of the HEO catalyst in the catalytic steam reforming of PLA. This study developed a novel high-entropy aluminate catalyst demonstrating efficient hydrogen-rich syngas production, providing an innovative approach for generating hydrogen-rich syngas from high-molecular-weight polymer plastics through pyrolysis coupled with catalytic steam reforming.
