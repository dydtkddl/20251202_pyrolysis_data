Title: Recycling of plastic waste using flash pyrolysis – Effect of mixture composition
Abstract: Recovery of plastic waste is becoming crucial since the amount of such waste increases continuously. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the pyrolysis technique for the recovery of plastic waste. In that frame, the influence of temperature (550°C or 600°C) on the pyrolysis of pure polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was first studied. It is shown that whatever the type of polymer, aromatic compounds are mainly formed and could reach 55wt.-% of the oil fraction for PP and 31wt.-% for PE at 550°C. In a second step, a PP/PE mixture and a model mixture representative of the packaging plastic waste stream were pyrolyzed to investigate the influence of a combination of polymers on the proportions and composition of the different fractions. The pyrolysis of the polymer mixtures shows that, even if the aromatic compounds formed are similar to those obtained for the virgin polymers, the proportion of aromatic compounds is much more important than when the polymers are pyrolyzed alone. Indeed, mixing PE with PP at a 50/50 ratio does not affect the amount of liquid, gas and solid fractions but leads to the formation of a higher quantity of xylene (39 wt-%) at 550°C. The combination of the plastics in the model mixture has also led to a decrease of the amount of waxy compounds. Furthermore, it was shown that a higher amount of aromatics than expected was formed. As a conclusion, this study demonstrates that pyrolysis is an effective technique to recover plastic waste as aromatic compounds for the petroleum industry. In the specific conditions used in this study (proposed model mixture and pyrolysis conditions), it will favor the idea that sorting is not needed to recover plastic waste through pyrolysis since aromatics formation is favored when the stream is composed of a mixture of polymers.
