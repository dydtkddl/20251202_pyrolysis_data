Title: Enhancement of bio-oil obtained from co-pyrolysis of lignocellulose biomass and LDPE by using a natural zeolite
Abstract: The quality of the bio-oil was improved through co-feeding of peanut shells with plastics and the use of clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, as catalyst. The main advantage of using this catalyst is its low cost. The material was tested in two different forms, natural zeolite without treatment (ZN) and in protonic form (H-ZN.TA). The reaction was carried out at 550 °C for 20 min, completely converting the feed waste into liquid, gaseous, and solid product fractions. Both catalysts gave a selectivity close to 45 wt% towards liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The best results were obtained with the ZN, which generated a bio-oil with very low water content (2 wt%), a reduction of ~90 wt% with respect to the pyrolysis of the biomass. Moreover, oxygenated compounds decreased to 50 wt% with increasing aliphatic and aromatic compounds.
