Title: Synergistic enhancement of bio-oil production, quality, and optimization from co-pyrolysis purun tikus (Eleocharis dulcis) and plastic waste using response surface methodology
Abstract: This study investigated the influence of varying pyrolysis temperatures (400–600°C) and biomass-to-plastic waste ratios (100:0, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, and 40:60) on the product distribution during the co-pyrolysis of Purun tikus (PT) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). The investigation revealed positive synergistic interactions. Notably, the bio-oil yield experienced a significant enhancement under optimal operational conditions (feedstock ratio of 40PT:60PET and a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C), with the yield doubling that of the feedstock ratio of 100PT. The composition of bio-oil compounds was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing that the most abundant compounds were esters (ranging from 30.1 % to 37.2 % area), phenolics (ranging from 11.3 % to 32.2 % area), and furfural (ranging from 4.5 % to 18.5 % area). The study further explored the impact of different experimental conditions on the yields of bio-oil, bio-char, and syngas through the application of response surface methodology. It was determined that the optimal yield of bio-oil was attainable by adjusting the reaction temperature and the ratio of PT to PET. The identified optimum conditions, which resulted in the maximum bio-oil output of 40.46 %, were a PT to PET ratio of 40:60 and a temperature of 600°C.
