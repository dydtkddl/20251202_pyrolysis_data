Title: Integral recycling of polyester based end-of-life fibre reinforced plastic waste towards syngas generation
Abstract: Valorisation of chemical compounds derived from the thermal decomposition of the plastic matrix in fibre reinforced plastic waste is claimed as crucial for cost-effective recycling of this waste. This work, validated the application of a thermal treatment (900 °C) to the volatiles generated from the pyrolysis of four end-of-life glass fibre reinforced polyester waste in a fixed bed tubular reactor placed in series with the pyrolysis reactor. Thermal treatment of pyrolysis volatiles' improves current scenario by transforming the hazardous liquids and low quality gas into almost non-existent aqueous liquid and maximised synthesis gas stream (CO + H2).
