Title: Enhanced microwave absorption capacity of iron-based catalysts by introducing Co and Ni for microwave pyrolysis of waste COVID-19 Masks
Abstract: Inexpensive iron-based catalysts are the most promising catalysts for microwave-assisted deconstruction of waste plastics. However, the microwave heating efficiency of most of the synthesized iron-based catalysts is very low, in particular, the FeAl catalyst was prepared by microwave combustion method, and its mixture with disposable medical masks (DMMs) was only heated to about 150℃ within 10 min. Here, we introduce the second-phase metals (Co or Ni) into the FeAl catalyst, resulting in the rearrangement of the catalyst structure and electrons to give the catalyst good microwave absorption ability. The mixture of the catalyst and DMMs can be quickly heated to above 900℃ in 10 min, especially after reaching the melting point of plastic, the instantaneous heating rate reaches 350 ℃·min−1. under the unique microwave hot-spot pyrolysis mechanism, DMMs can be rapidly pyrolyzed into carbon nanotubes (19.65 wt%) and gas (77.65 wt%) within 14 min due to the efficient dehydrogenation efficiency and activity of Co. The corresponding H2 yield is up to 38.66 mmolH2·g−1 DMMs, and the percentage of CO and H2 in the gas is as high as 90 wt%. This work improves the microwave conversion efficiency of iron-based catalysts by introducing second phase metals, and waste DMMs were efficiently converted into CO, H2 and CNTs, which can also be extended to other polymer or biomass chemical cycles.
