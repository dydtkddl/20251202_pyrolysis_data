Title: Clean energy technology: Hydro-processing of waste tyre pyrolysis oil (WTPO) to diesel fuel in a continuous reactor using Co/SBA-15 catalyst
Abstract: The need for sustainable fuel sources and efficient waste management has led researchers to explore innovative methods for converting waste into fuel. One promising avenue is the utilization of 100 % tyre oil (TO), which could offer a profitable and environmentally friendly solution for disposing of waste tyres. With rising fossil fuel costs, environmental concerns, and the challenges of waste tyre landfilling, there is increased interest in waste tyre pyrolysis oils (WTPO) as an alternative energy source. This study examines the hydro processed WTPO (HWTPO) was analysed using a metallic catalyst, specifically Co/SBA-15. This method involves hydrolysing WTPO with the metallic catalyst, assessing the physical-chemical properties, formulation efficiency compared to petroleum products, and diesel engine performance like the impact on fuel consumption, combustion, and emissions. The synthetic HWTPO's chemical and physical properties were found to be comparable to European diesel specifications (European standard 590). Under hydroprocessing conditions (80 bar and 375 °C), the Co/SBA-15 catalyst produced isoalkanes, n-alkanes, and aromatics in quantities nearly equivalent to 100 % diesel. HWTPO demonstrated the potential to maximize greenhouse gas emissions reduction and enhance the performance of diesel-powered engines. The favourable properties of HWTPO suggest that waste tyre pyrolysis oil could be a viable transportation fuel.
