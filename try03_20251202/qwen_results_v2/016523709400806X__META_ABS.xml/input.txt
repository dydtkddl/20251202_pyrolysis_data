Title: Kinetic model of the pyrolysis of polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor
Abstract: A kinetic study of the pyrolysis of polyethylene (HDPE) in a fluidized sand bed reactor was carried out. The HDPE particles were discharged onto the fluidized bed; in the upper part of the reactor, the volatiles evolved from primary reactions underwent secondary cracking reactions. A correlation model was applied to simulate the primary and secondary reactions, as well as the heat transfer process. The experimental yields of the total gases obtained in 41 runs performed at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900°C fitted satisfactorily with the proposed model. The values of the kinetic parameters of the secondary reactions and the heat transfer coefficient from the bed to the sample were optimized.
