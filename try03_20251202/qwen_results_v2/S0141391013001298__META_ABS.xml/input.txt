Title: Thermal behaviour of binary and ternary copolymers containing acrylonitrile
Abstract: Three types of acrylonitrile copolymers (acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer (ABS 1 1 Acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer. ), acrylonitrile-styrene random copolymer (SAN 2 2 Acrylonitrile-styrene random copolymer. ) and acrylonitrile-butadiene random copolymer (BAN 3 3 Acrylonitrile-butadiene random copolymer. ) were studied by thermogravimetry (TG/DTG 4 4 Thermogravimetry. ) and by pyrolysis in a semi-batch process at 450 °C in order to find structure–thermal behaviour relationships. The overlapped thermo-oxidative degradation processes were separated and the corresponding kinetic parameters were calculated. The TG/DTG studies have evidenced that the styrene-acrylonitrile interactions stabilize the nitrile groups reacting by chain scission rather than cyclization and destabilize the styrene units. Also, the cyclization of the acrylonitrile units in ABS is favoured by interactions with the styrene and butadiene units. The pyrolysis behaviour evidenced that the styrene-acrylonitrile interactions in SAN and ABS lead to the formation of 4-phenylbutyronitrile as the most important decomposition compound. ABS shows similar composition of the degradation oil with SAN copolymer therefore in the ABS the styrene-butadiene interactions are less important than those between styrene and acrylonitrile units.
