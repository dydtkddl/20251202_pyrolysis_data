Title: Obtainment of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites by alkaline treatment for the polyethylene catalytic cracking
Abstract: Great efforts have been applied in order to achieve the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites through post-synthesis alkaline treatment. In this case, the use of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites as acid catalysts in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins overcomes some diffusional limitations and expands the selectivity of products. Thus, the purpose of work was to promote a secondary porosity in ZSM-5 zeolite by NaOH treatment (using conventional electric and microwave heating methods), applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as pore-directing agent. Both heating methods generated additional secondary porosity, with microwave heating promoting a narrow pore size distribution, when compared to conventional. All hierarchical ZSM-5 have been showed low-density polyethylene conversions superior to the purely microporous ZSM-5, however the hierarchical zeolite processed by conventional electric heating reached the higher temperature reduction (42.6 K). It was evidenced through measurements of morphological and textural properties, ion exchange capacity and catalytic activity in the LDPE cracking that the CTAB cations exerts a protective effect at alkaline treatment avoiding the desilication process. The additional secondary porosity promoting the generation of compounds of lower molecular mass in LDPE catalytic cracking, by thermogravimetric analysis, proving that the alkaline treatment increases the accessibility to the active acidic sites of zeolitic catalysts for bulky molecules.
