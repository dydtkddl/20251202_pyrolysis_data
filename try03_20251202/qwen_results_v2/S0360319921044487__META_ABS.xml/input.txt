Title: Pyrolysis characteristics of RDF and HPDE blends with biomass
Abstract: The main objective of this work was to study refuse-derived fuels (RDF) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) upgrading by pyrolysis of blends of these materials with wood. The study considered three operational conditions: cracking temperature, heating rate, and different wt.% of RDF and HDPE. The results demonstrate that the cracking temperature of 500 °C and the faster heating rates increased the liquid yield for RDF blends. On the other hand, HDPE blends favor gas production at 550 °C and faster heating rates, which enhance the process operativity because polymeric materials generate waxes and are reduced beneath such conditions. Finally, produced gas LHV increases as RDF and HDPE were added. For example, the LHV of the produced gas only with wood at 550 °C and 20 °C/min was 10.34 MJ/m3 and with 25 wt% HDPE was 14.82 MJ/m3.
