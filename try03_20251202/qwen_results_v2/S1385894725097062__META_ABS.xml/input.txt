Title: Evolution of phosphorus during co-pyrolysis of wheat straw and mulch film components
Abstract: Large amounts of crop straw and plastic wastes are simultaneously generated in the farmland covered with mulch film during agricultural production. To investigate the feasibility of synergistic treatment of crop straw and plastic wastes, co-pyrolysis of wheat straw and various mulch film components (i.e., non-degradable polyethylene, PE and bio-degradable polylactic acid, PLA) was conducted at different temperatures (300–700 °C) and blending ratios (5–20 wt%), the evolution of biochar and speciation of phosphorus (P) driven by the blending of mulch film was investigated. In comparison with PE, the presence of PLA showed a more profound facilitation effect on the thermal degradation of wheat straw according to the thermogravimetry results. Compared with single wheat straw pyrolysis, the composite biochar derived from co-pyrolysis had a lower yield, a higher pH value and a lower ash content, which was further affected by the type and addition dose of plastic. The addition of PE and PLA promoted the transformation of organic P to inorganic P and low pyrolysis temperature and low-dose of plastic are beneficial to the retention of P in the composite biochar. Notably, co-pyrolysis of plastic films and wheat straw could improve the availability of P in the composite biochar, especially for the high-dose biodegradable PLA addition at low pyrolysis temperature. Therefore, co-pyrolysis of wheat straw and mulch films could be a promising technique to achieve the harmless treatment of these agricultural wastes and efficient reclamation of P.
