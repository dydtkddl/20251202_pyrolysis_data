Title: Microwave-coupled recycling of plastic waste into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes over economical iron-based catalyst
Abstract: Recycling plastic waste via chemical treatment is a promising strategy that continuously contributes to a sustainable world while is frequently limited by high energy consumption and the use of expensive catalysts. Herein, an economical Fe–Fe3C@C catalyst has been developed using fast microwave-based synthesis methods, the catalyst can efficiently and powerfully convert plastic waste into high-purity hydrogen (H2) and value-added carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under microwave irradiation. Results indicate that H2 yields reached significantly high levels of 69.4 mmol g-1 plastic, 70.7 mmol g-1 plastic, 71.2 mmol g-1 plastic and 37.2 mmol g-1 plastic when treating LDPE, HDPE, PP and PS waste, respectively, achieving almost 100% hydrogen efficiency, together with high CNTs purity of 94.9% in the resulting carbonaceous. Importantly, this microwave catalysis also reduces energy consumption by over 85% compared to traditional thermal catalysis, indicating a new breakthrough, more economical and highly valuable future for plastic waste management.
