Title: Chitosan-assisted reassembled hierarchical HZSM-5 for selective production of monocyclic aromatics in catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic
Abstract: Biomass presents significant potential as an alternative template agent for assisting zeolites in developing new pore structure during recrystallization to enhance their catalytic performance. In this study, a new hierarchical HZSM-5 was synthesized through the in-situ reassembly of alkali-treated HZSM-5 with chitosan as an assisting agent. The impact of chitosan dosage on the catalytic performance of the hierarchical HZSM-5, as well as the influences of temperature, catalyst dosage, and corn stover (CS) to high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mass ratio on the content and selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) during the catalytic co-pyrolysis process, were thoroughly investigated. The results indicated that chitosan exhibited great potential as a template in the reassembly of hierarchical HZSM-5 during NaOH treatment, promoting the formation of weak acid sites and micro-mesoporous structures. Compared to the parent HZSM-5, the chitosan-assistant reassembled hierarchical HZSM-5 significantly enhanced the production of MAHs and inhibited the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The highest carbon yield of MAHs reached 36.9 % at 550 °C with a chitosan dosage of 15 %. Furthermore, the chitosan-modified HZSM-5 notably enhanced the synergistic production of MAHs by 38.2 %, while preventing the formation of PAHs and coke. This study contributes insights into the sustainable synthesis of hierarchical HZSM-5 for improved production of high-value products in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics.
