Title: Biomass-derived porous carbon-supported nickel–iron bimetallic nanocatalysts for the catalytic conversion of plastics into oil and carbon nanotubes
Abstract: The conversion of waste plastics into high-value products through catalytic cracking offers a promising solution to plastic pollution. This study developed a novel method to synthesize porous carbon-based catalysts (0.1FeNi-MEC, 0.15FeNi-MEC, and 0.2FeNi-MEC) loaded with iron-nickel bimetallic nanoparticles using rapid, energy-efficient microwave pyrolysis with biomass as a sustainable precursor. These catalysts were applied to the pyrolysis of polypropylene and polystyrene, enabling the simultaneous production of high-quality oil and carbon nanotubes. During biomass pyrolysis, iron and nickel ions facilitated pore expansion and were in-situ reduced to Fe3Ni2 nanoparticles, uniformly anchored on the porous carbon skeleton. The oil yield from polypropylene and polystyrene pyrolysis decreased with increasing temperature, with styrene and small-molecule oils (e.g., toluene) dominating below 600 °C. At 600 °C, the 0.2FeNi-MEC catalyst achieved a carbon nanotube yield of approximately 30% from polystyrene pyrolysis, with carbon nanotube diameters mainly around 40 nm, while polypropylene pyrolysis yielded about 20% carbon nanotubes. This study innovatively utilized microwave-prepared carbon-based catalysts, demonstrating a sustainable strategy for plastic waste management and nanomaterial production, contributing to the circular economy.
