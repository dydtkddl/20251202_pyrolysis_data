Title: Co-pyrolysis of cellulose and polyethylene terephthalate by TG-MS: Pyrolysis behavior, conventional gas and solid phase product characteristics
Abstract: This research investigates the mechanism of co-pyrolysis in waste-blended textiles (polyester/cotton blends). Thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry analysis were utilized to study the mass loss behavior and gas emission characteristics of cellulose (CE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with various mass ratios during pyrolysis. The EA, BET and FTIR analysis were used to investigate the interaction among the solid phase products. The findings revealed a clear synergistic effect between CE and PET. When the theoretical and actual thermogravimetry/gas release curves were compared, the synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis process inhibited a release of small volatile substances (H2, CH4, C2H2, CO and CO2) at high temperatures and directly promoted hydrocarbon enrichment in solid products, which could affect the adsorption performance of solid phase products, and the inhibition effect was strongest when the ratio was 35:65.
