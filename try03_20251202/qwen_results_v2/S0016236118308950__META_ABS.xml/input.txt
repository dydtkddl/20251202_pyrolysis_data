Title: Synergistic effects on char and oil produced by the co-pyrolysis of pine wood, polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride
Abstract: The synergistic effects of the woody biomass (pine wood (PW)) and plastics (polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) during co-pyrolysis on the properties of char and oil were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and fixed bed reactor. The results showed that PW-PE interaction increased the maximum weight loss rate of PW by 8.0–23.7%. Co-pyrolysis of PW-PE blends produced lower quantity of char (13.8–22.4%) and higher quantity of oil (3.7–4.4%) as compared to the theoretical results. PW-PVC interaction decreased the temperature corresponding to the maximum weight loss rate of PW by 47–51 °C. Co-pyrolysis of PW-PVC blends yielded more char (15.5–27.9%) and less oil (7.2–14.4%) than expected values. Also, the interaction of biomass and plastic materials decreased the H/C atomic ratio of char, which resulted in a higher chemical stability of char. The fuel quality of oil produced from mixtures was improved due to a lower O/C atomic ratio of oil as compared to the theoretical results.
