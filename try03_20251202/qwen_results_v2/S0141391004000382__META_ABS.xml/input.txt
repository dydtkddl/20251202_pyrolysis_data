Title: Thermal degradation of PE and PS mixed with ABS-Br and debromination of pyrolysis oil by Fe- and Ca-based catalysts
Abstract: Polymer mixtures containing 8g of high density polyethylene (PE) or polystyrene (PS) and 2g of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer containing a polybrominated epoxy type flame retardant (ABS-Br) were thermally degraded at 450°C. FeOOH and two carbon composites based on iron (Fe-C) and calcium (Ca-C) were used for catalytic decomposition and their effect on the bromine and nitrogen amount and distribution in pyrolysis oil was determined by GC-AED analysis. It was found that iron-based catalysts removed bromine from pyrolysis oil and decreased the nitrogen amount converting nitrile compounds into ammonia. Calcium carbon composite had lower effect especially on the pyrolysis of PS/ABS-Br mixture. These liquid products can be used as fuel oil or feedstock in petroleum refinery.
