Title: Recovery, separation and production of fuel, plastic and aluminum from the Tetra PAK waste to hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes
Abstract: The establishment of a method of separation of materials from Tetra Pak waste to obtain products for use as raw material, fuel or other purposes was investigated in this study. First, the feasibility of hydrothermal treatment for the production of a solid fuel (hydrochar) and solid fraction formed by polyethylene and aluminum, called composite was analyzed. The results indicated that hydrothermal treatment performed at 240 °C yield the formation of hydrochar with good properties for its use as fuel and a composite of polyethylene and aluminum. The best conversion and separation of the cardboard and polyethylene/aluminum were obtained using 120 min as operating time. Then, the recovery of the aluminum fraction from the composite by using spent olive oil waste was studied. A partial separation of the composite layers (polyethylene and aluminum) was accomplished with improved aluminum purity for higher operating temperatures. Finally, the operating conditions of the pyrolysis process for the production of a solid (char) and high purity composite (aluminum) were optimized. The characterization results indicated that both char and aluminum resulting from the pyrolysis of the Tetra Pak at 400 °C still have a significant amount of polyethylene while higher purity levels of aluminum can be obtained at temperatures equal of higher than 500 °C.
