Title: Enhanced production of BTX from PET-LDPE co-pyrolysis via Ga- and Zn-impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts
Abstract: The coexistence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyolefins in plastic waste poses a significant challenge for pyrolysis-based recycling, as PET decomposition generates oxygenates that reduce product quality. To address this, we developed a two-stage reactor system that catalytically upgrades vapors from PET–LDPE mixtures using Ga- and Zn-impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts. XPS analysis revealed that impregnation with Ga and Zn leads to the formation of GaOx and ZnOH+ species, which introduce new Lewis acid sites. When these sites are located near Brønsted acid sites, synergistic interactions enhance both deoxygenation and aromatization, improving the catalytic performance of HZSM-5. At 600 °C, PET pyrolysis produces significant amounts of CO2, CO, and benzoic acid, resulting in oxygen-rich pyrolysis oil. While unmodified HZSM-5 achieves full deoxygenation, the resulting PyOil yield is modest, ranging from 24 to 34 wt%. In contrast, Ga- and Zn-modified catalysts increase PyOil yield to ∼50 wt% and improve mono-aromatic (BTX) selectivity to 80–89 % by shifting the acid site distribution toward weaker acidity, thereby favoring decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and aromatization. Notably, Zn-HZSM-5 maintained high BTX selectivity even with increasing PET content, outperforming Ga-HZSM-5, which exhibited higher polyaromatic hydrocarbon formation under similar conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of Ga- and Zn-modified HZSM-5 catalysts for the efficient conversion of mixed plastic waste into BTX-rich oils suitable for fuel and chemical applications.
