Title: Thermal – Catalytic cracking of real MSW into Bio-Crude Oil
Abstract: The thermal decomposition method has been able to convert of real municipal solid waste (MSW) into Bio-Crude Oil (BCO) which is mainly contained hydrocarbon fuel such as light oil (gasoline) and heavy oil (diesel). By this method, sustainable MSW management and energy problem can be considered. Hence, this research was conducted the pyrolysis experimental to BCO production from the real MSW under thermal and catalytic pyrolysis at 400 °C and 60 min for time reaction. To increase the BCO yield in this study, the natural activated zeolite as a catalyst was employed. BCO was analyzed by Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) which it can be used to identify carbon number range by percentage of peak areas. It was found that the catalytic pyrolysis has performances better than the thermal pyrolysis. Both of thermal and catalytic pyrolysis were the produce of BCO around 15.2 wt% and 21.4 wt% respectively with the main organic components are gasoline and diesel. Furthermore, paraffin and olefin fraction are major species in the gasoline and diesel. It can be concluded that the content of MSW and their processes has an impact on the fuel produced. In the thermal cracking produce BCO with higher content in the gasoline range. More plastic in MSW is also produce more gasoline while more biomass produces more in diesel range.
