You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS OIL FINGERPRINTING.

Context – Project Goal
----------------------
We are building a database of experimental plastic pyrolysis OIL COMPOSITIONS in order to train models that:
- (a) predict oil composition from plastic feed composition, and
- (b) infer plastic feed composition from measured oil composition (reverse mapping, oil → plastic).

Therefore, a paper is only useful if it provides (or clearly enables extraction of) experimental data about the LIQUID/OIL PRODUCT from plastic or polymer pyrolysis under lab-scale conditions.

Your task
--------
Given the TITLE and ABSTRACT of a paper, you must:

1) Decide whether it is truly about experimental plastic/polymer pyrolysis (NOT simulation-only, review, or non-pyrolysis research), and  
2) Decide whether it should be INCLUDED in an oil-composition-focused database for fingerprint-based reverse inference (oil → plastic).

You must make a TWO-STAGE decision:

Stage 1 – Pyrolysis & Experimental Check (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------------------
The paper must satisfy ALL of the following to pass Stage 1.

1. Plastic or polymer pyrolysis
   - It must involve thermal or catalytic decomposition of plastics or polymers.
   - Typical keywords (not exhaustive): “pyrolysis”, “catalytic pyrolysis”, “thermal cracking”, “thermolysis”, “depolymerization”, “plastic-to-oil”, “waste-to-fuel”, “plastic waste pyrolysis”, etc.
   - Feed can be virgin or waste plastic (e.g., PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, mixed plastics).

2. Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)
   The study must involve actual physical experiments on lab or pilot scale, for example:
   - Bench-scale pyrolysis reactor
   - Lab-scale fixed-bed, batch, semi-batch, fluidized-bed, microwave reactor, tube furnace, etc.
   - Catalyst tests performed in real reactors
   - Real measured outputs such as liquid/oil/wax yields, gas composition, char yield, etc.
   - Experimental characterization: GC, GC-MS, GC-FID, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.

   If the study is ANY of the following, it FAILS Stage 1:
   - Purely computational or simulation-based
   - Kinetic or reactor modeling without new lab experiments
   - LCA-only, TEA-only, or process design/optimization without experiments
   - ML-only, chemometrics-only, or purely theoretical work
   - Review, meta-analysis, perspective, or editorial without new lab data

3. Extractable experimental data
   - The abstract must clearly indicate that some QUANTITATIVE experimental data exist, such as:
     - Liquid/oil/wax yield (absolute or relative)
     - Product yield distributions (oil/gas/char)
     - Catalyst performance comparisons based on measured outputs
     - Temperature–yield or temperature–composition relationships
     - Measured chemical composition (e.g., GC-MS analysis of oil)
     - Engine or combustion tests using produced fuel
   - If it is ambiguous whether any usable experimental data exist, treat this as NO.

Stage 1 decision:
- If ANY of these Stage 1 criteria are not clearly satisfied, set:
  - "pyrolysis_related": "NO"
  - "include_in_oil_db": "NO"
  - Add appropriate Stage 1 flags (see “flags” list below).
- Only if ALL Stage 1 criteria are clearly satisfied, set:
  - "pyrolysis_related": "YES"
  and then continue to Stage 2.

Stage 2 – Oil-Fingerprint Relevance Check
-----------------------------------------
For papers that PASS Stage 1 ("pyrolysis_related": "YES"), decide if they are suitable for inclusion in an OIL-COMPOSITION–FOCUSED database used for reverse inference (oil → plastic).

Key question:
“Does this study provide, or clearly enable extraction of, experimental data about the LIQUID/OIL PRODUCT that reflects the plastic’s characteristic decomposition fingerprint?”

A. POSITIVE (INCLUSION) criteria – Favor these
----------------------------------------------
The paper is a good candidate for inclusion if:

1. Oil-centered output
   - The primary outputs include liquid/oil/wax products from plastic pyrolysis.
   - The study reports oil composition and/or detailed liquid product distribution, for example:
     - GC or GC-MS composition of the oil
     - Monomer/dimer/trimer distributions
     - CxHy distribution, boiling range fractions, or fuel-range fractions
     - Fingerprint patterns typical of specific plastics (e.g., styrene series for PS, long-chain linear hydrocarbons for PE).

2. Single plastic or well-defined plastic feed
   - Especially valuable if the feed is:
     - A single polymer (e.g., pure PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET), or
     - A clearly defined mixture of plastics with known composition.
   - These “single-plastic” or “well-defined mixture” data form the core of the fingerprint reference database.

3. Reasonable catalyst conditions
   - Best case: non-catalytic (thermal) pyrolysis of a single plastic with oil composition data.
   - Also acceptable: widely used, general-purpose catalysts (e.g., common zeolites, typical metal oxides) where results are not overly specific to a unique, one-off catalyst.
   - The focus should remain on the plastic feed and product composition, not on highly specialized catalyst mechanisms.

4. Extractable quantitative information on oil
   - Liquid/oil yield vs temperature
   - Oil vs gas vs char distributions
   - Oil composition from GC/GC-MS
   - Distillation cuts of oil and their properties
   - Data that can be used as fingerprints for plastic-to-oil and oil-to-plastic modeling.

B. NEGATIVE (EXCLUSION) criteria – Exclude from oil DB even if Stage 1 is YES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even if the study is about experimental plastic pyrolysis, EXCLUDE it from the oil DB (set "include_in_oil_db": "NO") if ANY of the following apply:

1. Target product is NOT oil (Hydrogen/CNT/Aromatics-focused)
   - The main purpose is hydrogen production, syngas optimization, CNT or other carbon nanomaterials, or specific aromatics production.
   - Typical patterns:
     - “hydrogen production”, “H2 yield optimization”, “syngas production”
     - “carbon nanotubes”, “CNT synthesis”, “carbon nanofibers”
     - “aromatics production”, “BTX production”, “high aromatics yield”
   - These studies usually:
     - Do not report detailed oil composition, OR
     - Optimize a specific product rather than preserving plastic-specific oil fingerprints.

2. Co-pyrolysis with biomass or coal (tri- or co-pyrolysis)
   - Feed includes plastic + biomass, plastic + coal, or multi-component waste where plastic is only one component.
   - The main focus is on synergy between biomass/coal and plastic, or overall co-pyrolysis behavior.
   - These systems distort pure plastic oil fingerprints.
   - Unless the abstract clearly states that there is a SEPARATE condition of pure plastic alone with oil composition data, treat co-pyrolysis as EXCLUDED by default.

3. Catalyst-mechanism–centered studies
   - Main emphasis is on catalyst mechanism (e.g., dehydrogenation, deoxygenation, CNT growth, acid site analysis), rather than on generalizable plastic oil composition.
   - Data are heavily biased toward explaining catalyst function rather than characterizing the plastic’s intrinsic decomposition pattern.

4. Exotic or one-off catalysts with narrow scope
   - Custom nanocatalysts used in only one paper with 1–2 feed types, designed for a very specific transformation.
   - These are less useful for building a broadly generalizable fingerprint database.

5. No usable oil information
   - The study measures only gas yield, syngas composition, char yield, activation energies, TGA/DTG curves, etc., without reporting liquid/oil composition or at least meaningful oil yield data.
   - If oil is barely mentioned or clearly not a focus, treat as NOT suitable for inclusion.

Stage 2 decision:
- If Stage 1 passes but the study is not suitable for oil fingerprinting (matches any NEGATIVE criteria above), set:
  - "pyrolysis_related": "YES"
  - "include_in_oil_db": "NO"
- Only set "include_in_oil_db": "YES" when:
  - Stage 1 passes, AND
  - The study is clearly oil-centered AND
  - Oil composition or at least detailed liquid product data are clearly present or inferable, AND
  - The focus is plastics (not biomass/coal co-feeds, not hydrogen/CNT/aromatics-focused), AND
  - The data are likely useful as a fingerprint reference for plastic-to-oil and oil-to-plastic modeling.

When in doubt about Stage 2 (oil relevance or data usefulness), be conservative and answer "include_in_oil_db": "NO".

Title: Studies on co-pyrolysis of microalgae and polymeric waste (plastic/rubber): Thermal behavior, kinetics, and product characteristics
Abstract: Frequent global health crises pose the challenge of effectively recycling the vast amounts of waste polymers generated by pandemics. The co-pyrolysis of polymers and microalgae to produce high value-added chemicals and fuels presents a promising solution for waste management. The present work aims to comprehensively study the thermal degradation properties, synergistic effects, kinetic parameters, product distribution, and pyrolytic oil composition of Chlorella vulgaris (CV), polystyrene (PS), and nitrile butadiene gloves (NBG) co-pyrolysis. The results show that the interaction during co-pyrolysis promotes CV decomposition. The kinetic analysis indicated that CV:PS:NBG reduced the activation energy at all phases. The master plot method shows that CV, PS, and NBG correspond to the order reaction model (F8), nucleation model (A2), and diffusional model (D3), respectively. Meanwhile, the 1D diffusion model (D1), second-order model (F2), and first-order model (F1) are more suitable for the pyrolysis processes of CV:PS, CV:NBG and CV:PS:NBG. The thermodynamic characteristics suggest that all components require external energy to form activated complexes, and the presence of polymers promotes this process. Co-pyrolysis greatly enhanced the pyrolysis oil yield, from 45.58 wt% for the CV alone pyrolysis to 67.36 wt% for CV:PS, 50.59 wt% for CV:NBG, and 61.43 wt% for CV:PS:NBG. Compared to the theoretical values, the pyrolysis oil derived from the ternary blend exhibited increases of 17.74 % and 7.04 % in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons, while the contents of N and O elements were reduced by 2.96 % and 2.54 %, respectively. The interaction mechanism and potential reaction pathways of CV with PS and NBG co-pyrolysis was proposed based on the reaction process. This study implies that CV co-pyrolyzed with PS and NBG could optimize energy output, providing theoretical and practical support for efficiently utilizing waste resources.
