Title: Synergistic co-pyrolysis of biogas residue and plastic mulch film: Mechanisms and product selectivity control
Abstract: The co-pyrolysis of agricultural waste, specifically biogas residue (BR), and plastic mulch film (MF) faces significant challenges in product selectivity control due to the unclear mechanisms by which heating rates influence reaction pathways. This study systematically investigates the synergistic effects of heating rates and blending ratios during BR-MF co-pyrolysis by comparing slow pyrolysis (20 °C·min−1, tubular furnace) and flash pyrolysis (instantaneous heating to 600 °C, Py-GC/MS). Flash pyrolysis at a 1:1 mass ratio substantially increases the total hydrocarbon yield to 79.93 %, exceeding the theoretical value by 50.99 %, driven by alkyl radicals (·CH3, ·C2H5) from MF cracking that selectively cleave C-O/C-N bonds in BR. This reduces the formation of oxygenates and nitrogenous compounds by 22.53 % and 99.64 %, respectively. In contrast, slow pyrolysis facilitates hydrogen radical coupling with oxygenated fragments, increasing alcohol production by 8.04 %, and promotes secondary aromatization, enhancing aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity by 9.37 %. Flash pyrolysis, however, improves the selectivity of olefins and long-chain alcohols by 25.70 % and 17.93 %, respectively, via a hydrogen transfer-radical stabilization mechanism. These findings provide a scientific foundation for the valorization of agricultural waste and propose viable strategies for biofuel and chemical production, with substantial implications for environmental sustainability and energy recovery.
