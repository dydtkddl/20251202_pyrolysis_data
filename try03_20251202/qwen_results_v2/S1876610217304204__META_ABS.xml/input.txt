Title: Thermocatalytic Studies on Municipal Solid Waste
Abstract: The goal of this study was to upgrade the decomposition products of municipal solid waste applying different catalysts during slow and high heating rate pyrolysis. The municipal waste studied was a mixture of biomass and plastics in a ratio of 1:1. Different zeolites (β- and Y-zeolites, ZSM-5 and FCC catalysts) and nickel-molybdenum (NiMo/Al2O3) catalysts were tested in order to upgrade the quality of the decomposition product mixture. The applied sample-catalyst ratio was 2:1. The evolution profiles of the gas phase decomposition products were monitored by thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS). The product distribution was analyzed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) technique. The effect of the catalysts on the biomass part of the waste sample is very similar. The thermal decomposition of the plastic fraction is catalyzed mainly by β-zeolite and ZSM-5, as the thermogravimetric and the mass spectrometric data indicate. The pyrolysis results unambiguously show the cracking effects of the applied catalysts on the composition of the evolving hydrocarbon mixture. The yield of the aromatic products is increased significantly.
