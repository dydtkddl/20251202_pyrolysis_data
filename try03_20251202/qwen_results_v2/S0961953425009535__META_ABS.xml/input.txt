Title: Co-pyrolysis of green coconut fibers with polymers: Enhanced the quality of produced bio-oil aiming bio-fuel production
Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of residual biomass with plastics emerges as a promising alternative for sustainable energy generation, mainly due to the environmental impact and the possibility of obtain biofuels and bioproducts. Biomass is recognized as a renewable resource while plastic waste poses an environmental challenge due to its high volume and low recycling rate. By merging these residues in a thermal conversion process, both can be transformed into biofuels, thereby reducing improper disposal and promoting the circular bioeconomy. In this study, bio-oils obtained from fast co-pyrolysis in a microscale fixed-bed reactor were chemically analyzed using gas chromatography (GC/MS) for compound identification. Green coconut fibers were collected, deposited on the soil, exposed to environmental factors for 30 days, and subjected to pyrolysis. The samples were characterized by proximate and elemental analysis, high heating value (HHV) and thermal gravimetrical analysis (TGA). Mixtures of this biomass with polymers (PP, HDPE, and LDPE), were pyrolyzed and the bio-oils were chromatographically analyzed. The analysis of resulting bio-oils revealed that the mixture containing 25 % of each of the three polymers and 25 % of biomass was the most effective, reducing phenols and furans, and eliminating ketones.
