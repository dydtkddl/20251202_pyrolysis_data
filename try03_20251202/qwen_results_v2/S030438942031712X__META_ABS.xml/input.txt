Title: Waste plastics recycling for producing high-value carbon nanotubes: Investigation of the influence of Manganese content in Fe-based catalysts
Abstract: Thermo-chemical conversion is a promising technology for the recycle of waste plastics, as it can produce high-value products such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen. However, the low yield of CNTs is one of the challenges. In this work, the addition of Mn (0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.%) to Fe-based catalyst to improve the production of CNTs has been investigated. Results show that the increase of Mn content from 0 wt.% to 10 wt.% significantly promotes CNTs yield formed on the catalyst from 23.4 wt.% to 32.9 wt.%. The results show that Fe-particles in the fresh catalysts are between 10−25 nm. And the addition of Mn in the Fe-based catalyst enhanced the metal-support interactions and the dispersion of metal particles, thus leading to the improved catalytic performance in relation to filamentous carbon growth. In addition, the graphitization of CNTs is promoted with the increase of Mn content. Overall, in terms of the quantity and quality of the produced CNTs, 5 wt.% of Mn in Fe-based catalyst shows the best catalytic performance, due to the further increase of Mn content from 5 wt.% to 10 wt.% led to a dramatic decrease of purity by 10 wt.%.
