Title: Low temperature upcycling of polyethylene to gasoline range chemicals: Hydrogen transfer and heat compensation to endothermic pyrolysis reaction over zeolites
Abstract: Selective production of gasoline ranged chemicals were of great interest in the field of plastic upcycling. This work reports exothermic hydrogen transfer reaction which was observed when HY zeolite was adopted to catalytic pyrolyze the polyethylene to gasoline ranged chemicals, while it was not observed when H-ZSM5 was used as catalyst. Both zeolite catalysts could significantly bring down the reaction temperature from 500 to 300–350 °C. TG-FITR analysis revealed that products obtained with HY zeolites were dominated with saturated hydrocarbons as compared to H-ZSM5 where the combination of alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics was obtained. In addition to the formation of saturated compounds, the TG-DSC analysis confirmed that, over the HY zeolites, the endothermic hydrogen transfer reaction of olefins occurred along with the pyrolysis of LDPE visibly when the zeolite ratio in the zeolite/polyethylene mixture exceeded 50% by mass. The TG results also indicated that the polyethylene undergone nearly 100% converted with very few residues. Further product analysis from batch pyrolysis by GC-MS confirmed that gasoline ranged iso-alkanes were produced over HY zeolite. This study highlighted that coupling exothermic hydrogen transfer reactions with endothermic pyrolysis could be an energy-efficient way of producing gasoline ranged chemicals. Chemical upcycling of plastics is tunable by using different zeolite combinations for the formation of desired products.
