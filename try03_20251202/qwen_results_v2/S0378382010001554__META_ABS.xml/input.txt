Title: Catalytic degradation of waste high-density polyethylene into fuel products using BaCO3 as a catalyst
Abstract: Waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was degraded thermally and catalytically using BaCO3 as a catalyst under different conditions of temperature, cat/pol ratio and time. The oil collected at optimum conditions (450°C, 0.1 cat/pol ratio and 2h reaction time) was fractionated at different temperatures and fuel property of the fractions and parent oil was evaluated by their physicochemical parameters for fuel tests. The results were compared with the standard values for gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil. Boiling point distribution (BPD) curves were plotted from the gas chromatographic study of the samples and compared with that of the standard gasoline, kerosene and diesel. The oil samples were analyzed using GC/MS in order to find out their composition. The physical parameters and the composition of the parent oil and its fractions support the resemblance of the samples with the standard fuel oils. The light fractions best match with gasoline, the middle fractions match with kerosene and the heavier fractions match with diesel oil in almost all of the characteristic properties.
