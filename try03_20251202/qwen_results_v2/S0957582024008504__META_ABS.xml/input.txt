Title: Transforming a mixture of real post-consumer plastic waste into activated carbon for biogas upgrading
Abstract: Plastic waste management is a current environmental issue that demands potential solutions since complete mechanical recycling is limited to the complexity and feasibility regarding the quality and purity of plastic waste. Pyrolysis has emerged as a reasonable solution for the recycling of those fractions that are not further suitable for recycling. Although the implementation of this technology is mature, the generated solid fraction or char has not been completely inserted in the closed loop of plastic recycling. This work explores the possibility of using the carbonaceous char as a precursor for the preparation of porous activated carbons for environmental application as CO2 adsorbent and biogas upgrading. The effect of the pyrolysis temperature (450 or 500 ºC) on the obtained chars has been assessed for the benefits in the second stage of chemical activation, exploring the possibility of the use of diverse chemical agents. The composition, textural, and surface properties of the porous materials were characterized. N2 isotherms showed that the char prepared at 500 ºC provided the best textural properties with a performance of K2CO3 ∼ KOH > Na2CO3 > NaOH > ZnCl2 > FeCl3. Isotherms of CO2 adsorption showed that the activation with K2CO3 displayed the best uptake (130.2 mg g−1 at 273 K), closely followed by KOH (125.0 mg g−1 at 273 K), also confirmed by dynamic tests in a fixed bed column configuration. The uptake was well correlated with the ultramicropore volume and the oxygenated functional groups. The CO2 and CH4 adsorption were studied either in static or dynamic assays. The behavior of the sample activated with K2CO3 was studied in detail in column tests, suggesting that the activated material exhibits promising behavior for biogas upgrading.
