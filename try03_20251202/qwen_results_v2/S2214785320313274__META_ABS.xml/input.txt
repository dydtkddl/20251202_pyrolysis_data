Title: Process parameter optimization study on thermolytic polystyrene liquid fuel using response surface methodology (RSM)
Abstract: Due to the accumulation of plastic wastes in solid waste and scarcity in the inventory of fossil fuel, plastic waste is necessary to recycling for fulfilling energy demand of modern civilization. Pyrolysis is the most significant recycling technique which has proved most effective and efficient in the conversion of plastic waste to sustainable energy such as liquid fuel and pyro gas. The present study incorporates developing the pyrolysis process for the conversion of waste poly-styrene to liquid fuel by optimizing the operating parameter using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with the assistance of design expert-12 programming. The four effective parameters such as size of poly-styrene (2–6 mm), weight of poly-styrene feedstock (250–750 gm), reaction temperature (350–500 °C) and retention time (10–90 min) for maximizing the liquid fuel responses achieved by 30 run of experiments using central composite design (CCD) matrix. A quadratic model was aliased to correlate the independent variables for maximizing the liquid product yield with the help of analysis of variances (ANOVA). Thus this investigation revealed that, reaction temperature and time was the most effective parameters on maximizing liquid fuel production for fulfilling objective followed by weight and size of poly-styrene. The characteristics of liquid fuel were analyzed by ultimate and proximate analysis, Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) for affirmation of liquid product.
