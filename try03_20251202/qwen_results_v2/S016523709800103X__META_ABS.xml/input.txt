Title: Cracking catalysts used as fluidized bed material in the Hamburg pyrolysis process
Abstract: The effects of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts as fluidized bed material on the pyrolysis of polystyrene and polyethylene were investigated at temperatures between 370 and 515°C in a scale of ∼1 kgh−1. The results were compared qualitatively with pyrolysis-GC-MS-experiments (200 μg). The catalytic influence on the product distribution is easily seen by the comparison to non-catalytic experiments with simple quartz sand. In the catalytic polystyrene pyrolysis, the product distribution is changed from the usual main product styrene (61 wt.%) to basic chemicals (18–26 wt.% ethylbenzene, 9–22 wt.% benzene, 1–7 wt.% styrene, 3–5 % toluene) and soot (15–23 wt.%). Surprisingly, it was shown that in the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene even at low temperatures (450–515°C) gases (48–52 wt.%) and low boiling aliphatic oils (38–39 wt.%) were received instead of waxes (∼90 wt.%) in non-catalytic experiments. A further success of the catalytic pyrolysis is a dramatic reduction of the process temperature. Pyrolysis-GC-MS-experiments confirmed these results qualitatively.
