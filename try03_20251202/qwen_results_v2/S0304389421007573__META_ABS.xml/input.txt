Title: Double-edged effects of polyvinyl chloride addition on heavy metal separation and biochar production during pyrolysis of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator
Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising technique to achieve the sustainable utilization of heavy metal hyperaccumulator derived from phytoremediation of contaminated soils. To investigate the feasibility of synergistic treatment of hyperaccumulator and plastic waste (i.e. polyvinyl chloride, PVC), co-pyrolysis of Sedum alfredii and different mass percentages of PVC (5–25 wt%) was conducted at 300–900 °C in the present study. High pyrolysis temperature and low PVC addition amount (5 wt%) effectively promoted the volatilization of Cd and Zn from S. alfredii, while high PVC addition amount (15 wt% and 25 wt%) caused a significant suppression effect at insufficient pyrolysis temperatures. After PVC addition, the yields of biochar increased by 5.18–37.19% as compared with the theoretical values. However, the concentrations of Cd and Zn leached from biochar significantly elevated with increasing PVC addition amount, indicating that the addition of PVC improved the mobility of Cd and Zn in biochar. Moreover, S. alfredii derived biochars showed considerable sorption capacity for Cd (87.6–198.3 mg/g). These results imply that the addition of PVC has double-edged effects on heavy metal separation and biochar production during pyrolysis of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator, and low PVC addition amount and sufficient pyrolysis temperature are beneficial for the further utilization of biochar.
