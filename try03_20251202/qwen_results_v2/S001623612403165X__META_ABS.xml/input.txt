Title: Metal-loaded biochar catalyzed pyrolysis of wood-plastic composite waste into gasoline and aromatic hydrocarbons
Abstract: A serial of biochar supported Fe catalysts (c-Fe5/L, c-Fe10/L, c-Fe20/L and c-Fe30/L) were prepared and applied to catalytic pyrolysis of wood-polyethylene composites (WPE). H-ZSM-5 and c-Fe were used as comparative catalysts. Under the influence of c-Fe20/L, pyrolysis products of WPE mainly include C5-C12 aliphatic hydrocarbons (35.4 %), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs, 50.5 %) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, 11.2 %). C-Fe20/L exhibits excellent deoxygenation ability and gives the highest MAHs selectivity. This is related to the well-dispersed Fe0 species with high activity, uniform mesoporous pore size (2.17 nm), high specific surface area (453.58 m2/g), and high acid amount (14.55 mmolNH3/g) of c-Fe20/L. In addition, the effects of different pyrolysis conditions (catalyst dosage and pyrolysis temperature) on the distribution of WPE pyrolysis products were explored. The c-Fe20/L reusability was also studied. The c-Fe20/L still maintains high deoxygenation ability after three repeated uses.
