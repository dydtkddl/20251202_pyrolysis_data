Title: Co-pyrolysis of bamboo residual with waste tire over dual catalytic stage of CaO and co-modified HZSM-5
Abstract: Experiments for an upgraded liquid oil production via fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo residual and waste tire over two catalytic beds of CaO and HZSM-5 were conducted, and the effect of CaO to HZSM-5 mass ratio on pyrolytic products distribution was investigated and analyzed. Furthermore, a novel modification method for enhancing the catalytic performance of HZSM-5 by an integrated alkali treatment and hydrothermal process was carried out, and the influence of co-modified HZSM-5 on products distribution was also studied. Experimental results revealed that the catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo residual and waste tire increased the relative contents of aromatics and olefins. Simultaneously, a use of dual catalytic stage of CaO and HZSM-5 further facilitated the relative contents of aromatics and olefins significantly, and inhibited the formation of undesirables like acids. A maximum yield of hydrocarbons could be reached at HZSM-5 to CaO mass ratio of 3:2. Furthermore, the co-modified HZSM-5 promoted the relative contents of aromatics and olefins compared with the fresh ones, which showed great promise for upgrading the quality of liquid oil.
