Title: Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE)to value-added products over HY, HZSM-5 and Hβ catalyst
Abstract: To reduce carbon emissions, environmental pollution, and to improve the circular economy, a microwave (MW) assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE)was carried out to yield valuable products such as aromatics, hydrogen, ethylene, and propylene gas. All three catalysts HY, HZSM-5 and Hβ were used as in-situ catalysts. Catalytic pyrolysis with HY, HZSM-5, and Hβ exhibited a lower liquid yield compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Gaseous fraction was mainly comprised of hydrogen, methane, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, and butane. It was found that methane (30.77 vol%) and hydrogen (55.24 vol%) were dominating gaseous products at 400 °C and 450 °C respectively using HY to LDPE ratio of 1:10. Whereas HZSM-5 facilitates formation of methane (65.94 vol%) at 400 °C and Ethylene (43.55 vol%) at 550°C. Hβ contributes to formation of alkanes and aromatics and gaseous products consist of majorly C3-C4 hydrocarbon gases which consist of 69.35 % propylene at 450°C. No sign of catalyst deactivation was observed even after 3 repetitive cycles.
