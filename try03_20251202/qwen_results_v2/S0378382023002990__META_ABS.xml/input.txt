Title: Fuel production from liquefaction of polypropylene in n-hexane solvent
Abstract: The excessive generation of plastic waste has become a major threat to the environment. Petroleum-based plastics, however, provided the opportunity for its re-conversion into fuel oil. In this study, polypropylene plastic was liquefied to produce liquid fuels in the presence of n-hexane solvent. The study was performed in a batch reactor at temperatures between 350 and 400 °C, reaction times between 0 and 150 min, and solvent-to-plastic mass ratios between 0:1–5:1. The effect of the different parameters was evaluated based on its yield amount and fuel quality. The results showed that the highest oil yield of 88.2 wt% was obtained at a temperature of 400 °C. A comparable oil yield of 88.0 wt% was also obtained at 150 min reaction time. The characterization results showed that the oil had density, viscosity and calorific value similar to the conventional gasoline. The GC–MS analysis showed that the oil was dominated by alkanes, alkenes and alcohol compounds with carbon numbers C6-C20, which is within the range of gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel. In addition, the production of oil from the liquefaction of plastic could serve as an alternative source to the depleting fuel as well as increase the value of plastics, leading to fewer environmental problems caused by plastic waste.
