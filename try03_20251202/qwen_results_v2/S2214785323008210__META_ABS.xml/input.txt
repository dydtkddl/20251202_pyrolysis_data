Title: Production and characterization of plastic oil from mixed plastic waste through the pyrolysis process
Abstract: With increasing population, modernization, and industrialization, plastic usage is increasing daily, resulting in massive plastic waste. The current research investigated the generation of plastic oil from mixed plastic waste. The pyrolysis process is a thermochemical reaction between 340 °C and 440 °C. The process residence time was one hour per batch. Thermal breakdown of plastic waste at optimal temperature produces volatile matter, which passes through a series of condensation processes in a water-circulating heat exchanger to make plastic oil. The maximum yield of plastic oil was obtained at 425 °C. The heating value of plastic oil measured was around 42.5 MJ kg−1, which signifies the utilization of plastic oil in various process industries. Non-condensable gases were collected and analyzed. Pyro-char is a solid byproduct of the plastic pyrolysis process that is mostly employed in road laying.
