Title: Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene to produce iso-alkane sustainable aviation fuel fractions: Comparison of in-situ and ex-situ pyrolysis modes
Abstract: It is crucial to develop a simple and rapid process for producing iso-alkane-rich sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without relying on external hydrogen supply. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) for SAF fractions production using zeolite catalysts including HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and MCM-41 in both in-situ and ex-situ modes. The results demonstrate that the HY catalyst yields the highest isomeric SAF fractions (31 area%) in the in-situ mode, whereas the HBeta exhibited maximal aromatic SAF selectivity (65 area%) in ex-situ mode, with complete absence of iso-alkanes. In the in-situ mode, the brief contact between iso-alkanes and acid sites on catalyst effectively suppresses the secondary cracking. However, for zeolites such as ZSM-5 with high acid concentration, isomerized alkanes are still difficult to retain. These results indicate that the effective production of iso-alkanes must be conducted under in-situ mode and requires zeolites with well-balanced acidity. The optimized distribution of acid sites in HY zeolite is found to be LAS/BAS = 3.42, which enhanced the production of iso-alkanes. Moreover, while the type of SAF fractions remained unchanged regardless of the polyolefin plastic used, polypropylene (PP) exhibited greater aromatic selectivity owing to its methyl-branched structure. This work provides a robust framework for converting plastic wastes into SAF, emphasizing acid sites and pyrolysis modes as key enablers.
