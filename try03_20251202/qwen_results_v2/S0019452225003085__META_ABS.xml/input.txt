Title: Influence of catalyst acidity of spent FCC catalyst and TiO2 on product distribution in microwave assisted LDPE cracking
Abstract: This study investigated microwave-assisted cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) utilizing in-situ spent FCC and TiO2 as catalysts and graphite powder as an absorber to reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Olefins, paraffins, and aromatics were major products of liquid fractions, whereas gaseous fraction primarily composed of propylene, propane, butene, and pentene. Obtained results indicated that optimal pyrolysis temperatures were 450 °C and 500 °C, respectively for spent FCC and TiO2. At optimized reaction conditions around 90 wt % gaseous products achieved which contain 67 % propylene with FCC, and 33 % propylene and 25 % butene with TiO2. In presence of spent FCC, paraffins, olefins, and aromatics were main liquid products, while TiO2 primarily produced paraffins and olefins as key products. Liquid products range from C8 to C30, making them appropriate for gasoline and diesel components.
