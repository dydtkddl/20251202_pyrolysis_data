Title: Optimized pyrolysis of household plastic waste in Indonesia for oil production: Hydrocarbon profiling, fuel alternative, and potential biomedical application
Abstract: The escalating generation of household plastic waste in Indonesia, driven by population growth and urbanization, necessitates innovative waste-to-energy solutions. This study investigates the pyrolysis of seven common household plastics: polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and others that under varying temperatures (300–500 °C) to optimize pyrolysis oil yields and characterize hydrocarbon profiles. Experimental results reveal that PP and LDPE exhibit the highest pyrolysis oil yields, reaching 78.3 % and 83.4 % at 400 °C, respectively, compared to HDPE (72.6 %) and PS (69.1 %). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis indicates temperature-dependent shifts in hydrocarbon distribution: PP and PS primarily produce lighter fractions (C6–C10), with PP yielding 42.5 % gasoline-range hydrocarbons and PS producing 39.2 %, whereas LDPE and HDPE generate heavier fractions (C16–C22), constituting 58.7 % and 54.3 % of their respective pyrolysis oils, making them more suitable for diesel fuel. In contrast, PVC and PET yield only 12.5 % and 8.9 % pyrolysis oil, primarily decomposing into gases and solid residues, highlighting their limited suitability for liquid fuel production. Beyond fuel applications, this study explores the biomedical potential of pyrolysis-derived hydrocarbons, including their role in pharmaceutical synthesis, medical-grade polymer development, and bio-based solvents. Pyrolysis oils containing specific hydrocarbon fractions (C8–C12) may serve as precursors for bioactive compounds, while purified derivatives could be repurposed for biomedical coatings or antimicrobial agents. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing pyrolysis conditions and feedstock selection, particularly in developing regions grappling with mixed plastic waste challenges, supporting both sustainable energy generation, and potential biomedical innovations.
