Title: Synergistic co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride and corn stalk for improved products and dechlorination behavior
Abstract: Efficient strategies for the environmentally safe utilization of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are crucial to minimizing its environmental impact. This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of PVC and corn stalk in an infrared heating reactor to enhance product quality and mitigate hydrochloric acid (HCl) formation. The process exhibited significant synergy, improving oil yield and chlorine retention in char. At 700 °C with 25 % PVC, oil yield increased by 12.66 %, while GC-MS analysis revealed a 17.51 % rise in aromatic compounds, accompanied by reductions of 29.30 % in aliphatic compounds, 10.43 % in nitrogen-containing compounds, and 2.17 % in chlorine-containing compounds. Co-pyrolysis promoted the cyclization of olefins from corn stalk, enhancing aromatic production. Chlorine distribution analysis showed that up to 72 % of chlorine was retained in the char at 500 °C, while HCl emissions were significantly reduced by 84 % at 700 °C. XPS and XRD results confirmed that K2O in corn stalk reacted with HCl to form KCl, effectively trapping chlorine in the char. These findings demonstrate that co-pyrolysis offers a promising approach for sustainable PVC recycling with reduced HCl emissions and enhanced oil quality.
