Title: Strategic conversion of plastic containers with food waste into energy through thermochemical processes
Abstract: Plastic valorization has received particular attention as an environmentally benign approach to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, contaminated plastic and biomass waste mixtures suffer from single-stream recycling. Waste mixtures are currently discarded through landfilling and incineration. As a sustainable disposal and valorization method for converting plastic and biomass waste mixtures into energy-intensive products, especially syngas (H2 and CO), this study utilizes catalytic pyrolysis and a CO2 flow gas. A plastic container contaminated with a food waste mixture (PFW) was used as the model waste. The major products of the pyrolysis of PFW were liquid hydrocarbons (HC) (C7–30) and wax-like HCs with negligible formation of oxygen-containing HCs. However, the high production of wax-like HCs becomes a problem. Catalytic pyrolysis was employed to convert HCs into simpler product streams such as syngas. Although syngas formation tripled with the Ni catalyst, catalyst deactivation was observed. To suppress catalyst deactivation and promote CO formation, CO2 was introduced instead of N2. During the CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, the syngas yield from PFW increased to 95.5 % because the chemical reactions between CO2 and liquid/wax-like HCs produced additional H2 and CO. The catalytic reaction with CO2 suppressed carbon deposition because long-chain HCs were converted to CO rather than coke.
