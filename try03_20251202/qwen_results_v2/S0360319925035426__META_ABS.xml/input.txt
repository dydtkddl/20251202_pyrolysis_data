Title: Mechanism of catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and polypropylene for hydrogen production: An experimental and DFT simulation study
Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) waste and cotton stalks (CS) addresses the dual environmental challenges of plastic pollution and agricultural residue disposal while leveraging their complementary properties (PP: H-rich; CS: C, O-rich) for enhanced H2 production. This study investigated the hydrogen production mechanism of lignocellulose via microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-MACFP) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations for the conversion of CS and PP. Co-MACFP (550 °C) with a SiC absorber was applied to PP-CS blends (1:1 ratio), mesoporous HZSM-5 (tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH)-modified, HT-1.0), and Ni-loaded HT-1.0 catalysts. The reaction mechanisms were determined via DFT simulations using β-d-glucopyranose and propylene as molecular models. The concentration of H2 obtained from the co-pyrolysis of CS and PP (the ratio is 1:1) was 32.7 vol% without catalysts, which exceeds the average concentration of 28.4 vol% ((27.1 + 29.7)/2) at 550 °C, indicating a synergistic effect between CS and PP. In addition, synergistic effects boost the H2 yield to 38.0 vol% with Ni-HT1.0 (vs. 32.7 vol% without catalysts), exceeding the theoretical averages from the individual feedstocks. PP-derived H· radicals (energy barrier: 454.8 kJ/mol) attack CS intermediates as the dominant low-energy pathway (204.4 kJ/mol), suppressing CO/CO2 formation via DFT. This integrated strategy enables efficient waste valorization and generation of green hydrogen. Future work should scale up catalyst synthesis and explore hybrid processes to improve economic viability.
