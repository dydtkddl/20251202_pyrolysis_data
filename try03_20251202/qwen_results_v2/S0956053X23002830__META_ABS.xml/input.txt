Title: Recycled PMMA prepared directly from crude MMA obtained from thermal depolymerization of mixed PMMA waste
Abstract: Recycled PMMA was prepared by directly polymerizing crude pyrolysis oils from lab-scale pyrolysis of collected industrial waste PMMA. The pyrolysis oils consisted mainly of methyl methacrylate (MMA, >85%), while the type and number of by-products from the thermal process were assigned through GC–MS analysis showing a clear correlation to the pyrolysis temperature. By-products can be removed by distillation; however, directly employing the crude oils to prepare PMMA through solution, suspension, emulsion, or casting polymerization was investigated to assess the potential for omitting this costly step. It was found that the crude pyrolysis oils could be polymerized efficiently via solution, emulsion, and casting polymerization to produce a polymer similar to the PMMA prepared from a pristine monomer. The impurities in the PMMAs prepared from the crude mixtures were investigated by extraction analyses followed by screening by GC–MS. In the case of casting polymerization, the GC–MS analysis, as expected, revealed various residual by-products, while solution and emulsion polymerization showed only very few impurities, mainly originating from the polymerization and not the feed material. Additional purification of the crude pyrolysis oils would be required for applications in casting polymerization. In contrast, direct polymerization by emulsion or solution polymerization is considered applicable for producing pristine PMMA from crude waste PMMA pyrolysis oil.
