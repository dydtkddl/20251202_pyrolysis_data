Title: Co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and rice bran wax‒ production of biofuel and its characterization
Abstract: The present study aims to investigate the interaction during co-pyrolysis of Polypropylene (PP) and Rice bran wax (RBW). Initial characterization of feedstock was found to be suitable to carry out further experimental sets. Further, the pyrolysis experiments of PP, RBW and different blends (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1 and 3:1) were carried out in a semi-batch reactor. As per TGA analysis the temperature range between 400 °C and 650 °C at a constant heating rate of 25 °C/min was determined. The maximum liquid yield of PP, RBW was approximately 76%, 86% at the temperature of 500 °C and 600 °C respectively. Whereas maximum liquid yield from co‒pyrolysis was obtained at 1:3 blend i.e. 81% at 550 °C. GC‒MS results inferred the highest percentage of hydrocarbon whereas 1:3 blends has lower oxygen containing groups than RBW in liquid products. FTIR data of all blends indicates higher range of alkyl and aromatic compounds. H1 NMR results also confirmed the higher compounds into aliphatic region than aromatics or heteroaromatics groups. Further, most of the fuel properties of 1:3 blend falls within the range of gasoline and diesel properties. Study was extended to know crystallization behaviour of fuel by DSC analysis from two consecutive heating and cooling cycles of −50 to 60 °C and reversed till −50 °C at 10 °C min −1. Two peaks at −24 °C and 26 °C were observed during heating cycle whereas single peak at 23 °C during cooling cycle. 1:3 blend residual char characterization was also included in the work. Unfortunately, the SEM and BET results inferred that the char was not highly porous.
