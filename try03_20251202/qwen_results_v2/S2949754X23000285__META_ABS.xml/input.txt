Title: Magnetic induction assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste to liquid hydrocarbons on carbon catalyst
Abstract: Carbon-based catalyst can effectively crack model waste plastic based on polyolefins under contactless induction heating and yield gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons fractions at mild reaction temperatures. High catalytic performances are reached thanks to the stable catalyst bed temperature arising from the high heating rate of the induction setup. By comparison to indirect Joule heating which required much higher temperatures, contactless direct induction heating allows a compensation of the internal temperature loss during such highly endothermic process through direct heat targeting. The single carbon-based catalyst combined a high and stable activity with an extremely high stability as a function of cycling tests with pure or mixed polymers. By comparison to the acid or metal based catalysts used in plastic cracking, such low cost carbon catalyst avoids deactivation within cycling tests and therefore provides an efficient and cost-effective route for waste plastic recycling and also as chemical storage means for renewable energy.
