Title: Fluidized bed pyrolysis of a recycled polyethylene
Abstract: Fluidized bed pyrolysis is a special class of feedstock recycling processes for plastics recycling which provides for a rather uniform spectrum of products, reduces the maintenance time and cost and gives the possibility to apply the process even on a relatively small scale. The present study describes investigations carried out by injecting recycled polyethylene in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor, batchwise or continuously operated. The batchwise experiments allowed to investigate the polymer-to-particles interactions inside the fluidized bed reactor, which strongly affect the phenomenology and the rate of polymer degradation. The continuous experiments indicated how the yield and the composition of products are affected by two key operating variables of the process: the bed temperature and the residence time in the reactor.
