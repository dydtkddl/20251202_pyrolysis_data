Title: Improving hydrogen production via ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of non-thermal plasma pretreated HDPE with 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
Abstract: Fast pyrolysis coupled with catalysis is a promising method for recycling waste plastic into value-added fuels, chemicals, and carbon materials. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was pretreated by non-thermal plasma (NTP) in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor where the discharge zone was packed with quartz glass beads, which enables the HDPE to present a low-degree of polymerization, high crystallinity, and rough surface morphology. The fast pyrolysis of pretreated HDPE significantly increased the content of C2–C4 light olefins in the pyrolysis vapors, notably the C2H4 content increasing by 19.78 % and 27.88 % after Ar and air NTP treatment, respectively. Compared with Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3, the novel 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst, which are characterized by a higher density of strong acid sites and superior ability to cleavage C−C and C−H bonds, possessed superior activity in upgrading of pyrolysis vapors, achieving a high H2 yield equivalent to 91.65 % hydrogen in HDPE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the C2H4 dissociation pathway prefers dehydrogenation followed by C−C bond cleavage and energetically favorable H2 evolution reaction (HER) rather than direct dissociation as indicated by lower dehydrogenation barriers on the surface of FeNi. This work provides a new insight for improving H2 yield in ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of HDPE.
