Title: Co-pyrolysis of waste wind turbine blades in a molten polyolefin medium
Abstract: This study investigates the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes of waste wind turbine blades (WWTB) and polyolefins (POs) at 450 °C in a round bottom tank reactor. The study contains three experimental sets: 1) batch pyrolysis of POs; 2) continuous pyrolysis of WWTB; 3) continuous feeding of WWTB into a molten PO medium, which was previously fed to the round bottom tank reactor batch-wise. Individual WWTB pyrolysis yields a modest 18.7 wt% of liquid, predominantly influenced by elevated ash and fixed carbon content. Conversely, co-pyrolysis demonstrates positive synergies, with escalating polyolefin content boosting liquid yields, reaching a peak at 61.5 wt% with a WWTB:POs mixture (25:75, wt%), while concurrently suppressing gas production to 21.6 wt%. The primary chemical groups found in the liquid obtained from WWTB are phenol and phenolic compounds, with their abundance diminishing as the POs ratio in feedstocks increases. Analysis of non-condensable gases from WWTB reveals that approximately 57.7 wt% are oxygen-containing, predominantly CO and CO2. Co-pyrolysis with POs at a 25:75 (wt%) ratio yields 47.1 wt% C3H6, resembling POs pyrolysis. The resulting solid products are rich in carbon and contains high ash. This research not only offers a detailed product analysis of WWTB but also sheds light on the dynamics of its co-pyrolysis with POs. Doing so contributes crucial insights into the transformative potential of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes, covering the way for sustainable waste-to-resource solutions.
