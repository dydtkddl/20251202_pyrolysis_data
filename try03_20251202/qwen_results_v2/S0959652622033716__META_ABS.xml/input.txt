Title: Waste plastic thermal-transformed CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO for free radical activation and bacteria sterilization
Abstract: Pyrolysis technology has been focused on waste plastics for recycling. However, there is rare research for reusing pyrolysis products (carbon nanotubes). Based on pyrolysis technology of waste polypropylene (PP) plastic, carbon nanotube coated Fe–Mo/MgO nanomaterial (CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO) was prepared by chemical vapor deposition to remove Gram-pathogenic bacteria. The addition of Mo and MgO promoted the cracking of PP plastic and the formation of MWCNTs. The as-obtained CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO can stimulate H2O/O2 to produce abundant ·OH, ·O2 − and 1O2 radicals, which probably resulting from the synergistic effect of delocalization of CNTs and REDOX pair of Fe3O4. Consequently, the removal rate of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO composite catalyst can reach 100% within 2h, without the help of any additional energy or active oxidant. At the same time, the material is remarkable stability and reusability with complete removal of pathogens after six cycles. This study not only provides a method for the synthesis of highly effective sterilizers, but also opens up a new direction for the application of functional carbon nanocomposites prepared by pyrolysis of waste plastics.
