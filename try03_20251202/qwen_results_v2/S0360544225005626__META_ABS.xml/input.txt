Title: Preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon-rich bio-oils by catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and plastics based on HZSM-5, MCM-41, and HZSM-5/MCM-41
Abstract: The catalytic co-pyrolysis processes of biomass components (microcrystalline cellulose (MC), xylan (XY), and alkali lignin (AL)) and plastics (polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS)) were studied using HZSM-5, MCM-41, and HZSM-5/MCM-41. For non-catalytic pyrolysis, the co-pyrolysis of MC and AL with plastics are beneficial for increasing the yield of hydrocarbons. The presence of MC, XY, and AL does not exert significant influences on the distribution of types of pyrolysis products of PP, and the interaction of the three components with PS is conducive to the generation of styrene. The introduction of catalysts can increase the yield of hydrocarbons in the co-pyrolysis products of biomass components and plastics. The combination of MC (52.39 %)/XY (35.77 %), PP, and HZSM-5 is most beneficial for increasing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly due to the synergistic effect between MC/XY-derived oxygenates and PP-derived hydrocarbons through the hydrocarbon pool mechanism, the hydrogen transfer reaction, and the Diels-Alder reaction. For the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and PS, HZSM-5 shows significantly superior selectivity for mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, while HZSM-5/MCM-41 and MCM-41 obviously promote the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The research provides a reference for the preparation of high-quality bio-oils through oriented co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.
