Title: From pandemic protection to fuel production: Conversion of waste personal protective equipment-kits to high-quality hydro-processed fuels
Abstract: The advent of COVID-19 has heightened apprehensions within the plastic waste management sector, particularly due to the increased adoption of single-use personal protective equipment (PPE)-kits at the domestic level and hospitals for protection against contagious diseases. This study addresses the issue by focusing on the hydro-processing of pyrolytic oil derived from thermally catalysed cracking of sterilized waste PPE kits. Employing an indigenously prepared FCC-supported Ni catalyst, the investigation delves into the effects of hydrogenation process parameters-temperature, catalyst composition, and catalyst loadings—maintaining a constant pressure of 70 bar H2 on fuel quality. Experimental results indicate that oil upgraded at a higher temperature of 240 °C with a 10% Ni/FCC catalyst at a 20 wt% loading demonstrates a remarkable selectivity of 76.51 wt% compounds in the C5-12 range, signifying a substantial gasoline fraction. The hydrogenated oil exhibits 57.05 wt% paraffinic content and a desirable 24.5 wt% yield of aromatics. GC-MS analysis reveals the presence of 25 wt% C5-7 iso-alkanes, 9.33 wt% toluene, and 12.35 wt% benzene, closely resembling the composition of commercial gasoline. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of the hydrogenated oil meet specifications for commercial gasoline suitable for automobile applications, making it a viable substitute or complement for blending with commercial gasoline.
