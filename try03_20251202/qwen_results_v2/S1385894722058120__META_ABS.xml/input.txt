Title: Plastic waste upgrade to olefins via mild slurry microwave pyrolysis over solid acids
Abstract: Chemical upcycling technologies are emerging as the most viable to combat plastic waste accumulation. Among them, catalytic pyrolysis is very promising as it is feedstock agnostic. However, the high energy demand associated with pyrolysis can lead to significant carbon dioxide production. Here, we demonstrate that coupling microwave heating with suitable solid acid promoters in a slurry reactor coupled with a distillation unit can overcome the energy-related challenge of conventional pyrolysis, by operating at modest temperatures (350–375 °C), enhancing transport, and furnishing high yields of olefins (∼88 %) in seconds, with medium-sized olefins (>75 %) composing a significant fraction. Reduced thermal gradients minimize coke formation, further improving the performance. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment indicate the potential of the technology.
