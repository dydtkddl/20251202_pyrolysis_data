Title: Evaluating sustainable biofuel production from Biomass-Plastic Co-Pyrolysis: Insights into PAHs formation and Bio-Oil yield
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of key process parameters on the formation and distribution of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in bio-oil derived from the co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and bagasse. A custom-designed pilot-scale auger pyrolysis reactor was used to analyze various feedstock compositions, including pure LDPE, 33 % bagasse-67 % LDPE, 67 % bagasse-33 % LDPE, and pure bagasse, across a temperature range of 450 °C, 525 °C, 600 °C, and 675 °C, as well as auger speeds of 2, 6, and 10 rpm, reflecting different residence times. The results indicated that higher temperatures and longer residence times promoted the formation of high-molecular-weight PAHs. The optimal bio-oil yield was achieved at 600 °C with a 67 %-LDPE mixture at 2 rpm, yielding up to 48.12 % with a total PAH concentration of 5853 mg/L. Meanwhile, the 67 %-bagasse mixture, with a bio-oil yield of 43.90 % at 525 °C and 2 rpm, showed the lowest total PAH content at 1518 mg/L. These findings elucidate the synergistic effects of feedstock composition and operational parameters on PAH formation, emphasizing the need for precise control of pyrolysis conditions to optimize bio-oil yield while minimizing harmful PAH content. This research contributes to the development of cleaner and safer biofuel technologies.
