Title: Pyrolysis of waste expanded polystyrene and reduction of styrene via in-situ multiphase pyrolysis of product oil for the production of fuel range hydrocarbons
Abstract: Upgraded fuel oil was produced from the waste expanded polystyrene (WEPS) using pyrolysis and in-situ selective aromatization in a specially designed reactor. The catalytic pyrolysis of WEPS was performed keeping the catalyst in three different types of catalyst arrangements inside the reactor i.e., A-type/catalyst in liquid phase, B-type/catalyst in vapour phase, and AB-type or Multiphase/catalyst in both liquid and vapour phases, respectively. The ZSM-5 ammonium powder was used as a catalyst with varying feed to catalyst ratio and 20:1 was found to be optimum. Aromatics of fuel range like benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene (BTE) were significantly increased and styrene got reduced by many folds when AB-type/multiphase catalytic pyrolysis was performed. The thermal pyrolysis produced maximum liquid yield of 94.37 wt% at a temperature of 650 °C and a heating rate of 15 °C/min. The maximum liquid yield of 88.05 wt%, 78.85 wt%, and 75.11 wt% were obtained for the A-type, B-type, and AB-type catalytic pyrolysis at the temperature of 600 °C, 550 °C and 550 °C, respectively using the same heating rate. The liquid oil of thermal pyrolysis contains very low amount of fuel range aromatics i.e., BTE of 11.38 wt% and the highest amount of styrene (84.74 wt%). In contrarily, BTE content for the catalytic process increased progressively in the order of 18.98 wt% (A-type) < 24.27 wt% (B-type) < 28.12 wt% (AB-type). The styrene content significantly decreased to a very low value of 46.30 wt% for AB-type/multiphase pyrolysis at the temperature of 550 °C.
