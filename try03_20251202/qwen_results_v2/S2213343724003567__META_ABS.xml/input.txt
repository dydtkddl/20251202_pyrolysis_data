Title: Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste using metal-incorporated activated carbons for monomer recovery and carbon nanotube synthesis
Abstract: As the global plastic waste crisis intensifies, innovative and sustainable solutions are urgently needed. This study evaluated waste-derived metal-incorporated activated carbon (AC) catalysts for the pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste to generate value-added products, focusing on product yield distribution, composition, hydrogen, and carbon nanotube (CNT) formation. Pyrolysis-catalysis experiments were conducted using a two-stage fixed-bed reactor, wherein the temperature was maintained at 500 °C in first stage (pyrolysis) and varied (500, 600, and 700 °C) in the second stage (catalysis). The tested ACs were incorporated with nickel (Ni-AC), iron (Fe-AC), and zinc (Zn-AC) to assess the impact of metal particles distributed on the carbonaceous support in the second stage. The results from the ACs were compared to those obtained using zeolite (H-ZSM-5), Raw-AC, and non-catalytic runs. The Ni-AC and Fe-AC demonstrated superior catalytic activity, with Ni-AC being more efficient in producing hydrogen (4.24 wt%) and CNTs (34.5 wt%) with diameters of approximately 30 nm, and Fe-AC leading to higher gas yields (68.8 wt%) and CNTs (12.4 wt%) of around 60 nm. In contrast, Zn-AC and Raw-AC presented limited effectiveness, although Raw-AC moderately outperformed Zn-AC with enhanced gas yields and reduced oil/wax yields. The zeolite H-ZSM-5 exhibited the highest gas yields (78 wt%), converting heavy fractions into lighter molecules, notably the monomers ethylene and propylene. These findings provide valuable insights into catalyst selection and optimization for plastic waste pyrolysis processes, with H-ZSM-5 being the most effective catalyst for monomer recovery, and Ni-AC and Fe-AC demonstrating promising results.
