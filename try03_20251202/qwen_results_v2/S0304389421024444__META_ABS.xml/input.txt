Title: Pyrolysis of long chain hydrocarbon-based plastics via self-exothermic effects: The origin and influential factors of exothermic processes
Abstract: Converting plastic wastes into value-added products through energy-efficient pyrolysis is essential, and it requires lower pyrolysis temperatures and shorter processing times than that of other processes. An exothermic phenomenon was observed during the process high-pressure polyethylene pyrolysis. It was proven for the first time that the exotherm is caused by a pressure-induced phase transition, in which colossal heat release can be driven by relatively small pressures. A large temperature change (> 100 °C) leads to the deep cracking of polyethylene, although the set temperature is far lower than the required temperature for thermal cracking. Importantly, the heat input stops immediately when the set temperature is reached; thus, the external heating time is short. Polyethylene can be completely converted into liquid products in ~90 wt% yield and with a small number of gases. The self-exothermic phase transition only occurs within a certain range of material thickness, which is related to the corresponding phase behavior. In the self-exothermic pyrolysis process, with an increase in the thickness of polyethylene, the proportion of low-value olefins in oil products decreases gradually, while alkanes, isoalkanes and aromatics show an increasing trend, making the product composition closer to the fuel standard. This work provides a viable approach for plastic recycling at low pyrolysis temperatures and short external heating times with the help of a self-exothermic phase transition in the absence of a catalyst.
