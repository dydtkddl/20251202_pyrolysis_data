Title: Production of liquid fuels and chemicals from pyrolysis of Bangladeshi bicycle/rickshaw tire wastes
Abstract: Tire wastes in the form of used bicycle/rickshaw tires available in Bangladesh were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed fire-tube heating reactor under different pyrolysis conditions to determine the role of final temperature, sweeping gas flow rate and feed size on the product yields and liquid product composition. Final temperature range studied was between 375 and 575°C and the highest liquid product yield was obtained at 475°C. Liquid products obtained under the most suitable conditions were characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, 1H NMR and GC–MS techniques. The results show that it is possible to obtain liquid products that are comparable to petroleum fuels and valuable chemical feedstock from bicycle/rickshaw tire wastes if the pyrolysis conditions are chosen accordingly.
