Abstract: Plastic waste poses a serious threat to the global environment, with recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic accounting for a considerable portion. The application of supercritical ethanol depolymerization technology presents an effective method for recycling PET waste. This study investigated using Ni as an additive to enhance the catalytic activity of ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for PET waste depolymerization. The effects of different catalysts, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and reaction time on PET waste depolymerization were studied using the single-factor controlled variable method. The results showed that the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 was the optimal catalyst, and under the optimal conditions with catalyst dosage of 4 %, reaction temperature of 260 °C, and reaction time of 60 min, the depolymerization efficiency of PET waste could reach 100 %, with the highest yields of diethyl terephthalate (DET) and ethylene glycol (EG) of 93.6 % and 90.2 %, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating conditions to obtain the highest monomer yields. The predicted optimal parameters from RSM were as follows: reaction temperature = 262.8 °C, reaction time = 63.2 min, catalyst dosage = 3.8 wt%, with the predicted highest DET and EG yields of 95.9 % and 90.7 %, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for DET and EG possessed the R2 values of 0.9921 and 0.9885, respectively, with p-values < 0.0001, indicating a good fit for the models. Furthermore, after five times reuse, the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst still exhibited good catalytic activity and stability.

Abstract: In this work, mixtures of vacuum gas oil and low density polyethylene, a major component of common industrial and consumer household plastics, were pyrolytically co-processed in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) riser reactor as a viable alternative for the energy and petrochemical revalorisation of plastic wastes into valuable petrochemical feedstocks and fuel within an existing industrial technology. Using equilibrium FCC catalyst, the oil–polymer blends were catalytically cracked at different processing conditions of temperatures between 773K and 973K and catalyst feed ratios of 5:1, 7:1 and 10:1. The influence of each of these processing parameters on the cracking gas and liquid yield patterns were studied and presented. Further analysed and presented are the different compositional distributions of the obtained liquids and gaseous products. The analysis of the results obtained revealed that with very little modifications to existing process superstructure, yields and compositional distributions of products from the fluid catalytic cracking of the oil–polymer blend in many cases were very similar to those of the processed oil feedstock, bringing to manifest the viability of the feedstock co-processing without significant detriments to FCC product yields and quality.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with vacuum gas oil (a petroleum-derived feed) without clear data on pure plastic oil composition or fingerprinting.,CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: This study explores the use of thermochemical co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and waste cooking oil as a sustainable pathway for converting plastic and lipid-based residues into liquid biofuels. Comprehensive characterisation is performed using thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess decomposition behaviour, product yields, and chemical composition across varying feedstock blend ratios. The addition of waste cooking oil is found to significantly reduce the initial decomposition temperature from 396 °C (pure waste polypropylene) to 315 °C, and to enhance the liquid yield, reaching a maximum of 70.00 % at a 1:1 blend ratio of the two feedstocks. Chemical analysis reveals a progressive increase in oxygenated functional groups and a shift toward longer-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C13–C18) with an increase in the content of waste cooking oil, features associated with improved combustion potential and fuel quality. Particulate matter analysis reveals notable variations in particle size distribution and concentration, with waste polypropylene alone generating predominantly ultrafine particles in the 3–30 nm range. In contrast, higher proportions of waste cooking oil and increased thermal load are found to shift the particle sizes toward the 20–40 nm range. These results indicate that the co-pyrolysis of plastic and cooking oil waste not only enables efficient waste valorisation but also produces bio-based liquid fuels with favourable chemical and emission-related properties. The findings support the development of integrated waste-to-energy strategies that are aligned with the concept of the circular economy and sustainable bioenergy goals.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with waste cooking oil, without separate data on pure polypropylene oil composition, distorts plastic fingerprint and is not suitable for oil-to-plastic inference.",CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: In this paper rejected streams coming from a waste packaging material recovery facility have been characterized and separated into families of products of similar nature in order to determine the influence of different types of ingredients in the products obtained in the pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis experiments have been carried out in a non-stirred batch 3.5dm3 reactor, swept with 1Lmin−1 N2, at 500°C for 30min. Pyrolysis liquids are composed of an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The aqueous phase is greater as higher is the cellulosic material content in the sample. The organic phase contains valuable chemicals as styrene, ethylbenzene and toluene, and has high heating value (HHV) (33–40MJkg−1). Therefore they could be used as alternative fuels for heat and power generation and as a source of valuable chemicals. Pyrolysis gases are mainly composed of hydrocarbons but contain high amounts of CO and CO2; their HHV is in the range of 18–46MJkg−1. The amount of COCO2 increases, and consequently HHV decreases as higher is the cellulosic content of the waste. Pyrolysis solids are mainly composed of inorganics and char formed in the process.

Abstract: The goal of this study was to upgrade the decomposition products of municipal solid waste applying different catalysts during slow and high heating rate pyrolysis.

Abstract: In this work, catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) over nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite in a batch reactor at 340°C was carried out with the aim of study both the catalyst resistance to deactivation and the catalyst regeneration process. For looking into the catalyst deactivation, consecutive polyethylene cracking experiments were carried out. Subsequently, the same reactions has been also performed but by regenerating the zeolite after each experiment by promoting coke combustion at 550°C under air flow. Zeolites used were two samples of nanocrystalline HZSM-5 with very different textural properties (sample A, with most of its surface corresponding to zeolitic micropores and sample B with a considerable amount of external surface, mesopores and super-micropores) in order to study the effect of their textural properties in the deactivation and regeneration experiments. Although conversion and activity values reached over both samples are quite high taking into account the mild conditions used, sample B shows a very much higher initial activity than A due to its improved textural properties. In both samples two different deactivation mechanisms occur: a reversible deactivation by coke deposition removable by the regeneration procedure, and an irreversible or permanent deactivation by other factors. Deactivation of sample B occurs faster due to the higher amount of coke deposited on this material. However, the improved textural properties of this catalyst supposes an advantage for the regeneration process, since coke deposited either on the external surface or on the super-micropores and mesopores, makes easier the regeneration procedure.",YES,NO,Focus on catalyst deactivation and regeneration mechanisms rather than plastic oil composition or fingerprint data.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS

Abstract: Polypropylene (PP) was pyrolysed over spent FCC commercial catalyst (FCC-s1) using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The influence of reaction conditions including catalyst, temperature, and ratio of polymer to catalyst feed and flow rates of fluidising gas was examined.

Abstract: Facing the challenges of organic industrial solid waste (OISW) disposal, co-processing of OISW by power plants has become a developing trend. In order to avoid feeding problems of OISW and enhance the combustion adaptability of the furnace, pyrolysis coupled with incineration technology is proposed as a potential method. Among various OISW, automobile shredder residue (ASR) is regarded as a promising fuel due to its high heating value. In view of engineering application, the researches focused on the products’ properties and economic evaluation under a wide range of heating rates which are insufficient. In this study, regarding the rapid pyrolysis by conducting the high-temperature flue gas as heating source in power plants, the pyrolysis behavior of ASR was correspondingly studied under a wide range of heating rates. The formation of volatiles and property’s improvement were further investigated for generating high-valued oil. Results showed that the high heating rate is not only beneficial to the homogenization of pyrolytic products but also the aromatization in oil and radical generation in gases. Importantly, it also contributed to the cleavage of the single bond connected to the benzene ring and carbon-oxygen single bond for esters. By conducting the enhanced cracking of volatiles, the wax-like fraction was significantly reduced. In addition, the deoxygenation in oil (oxygen content decreased by 20 wt%) and high heating value of gases (increased by 73%) were improved.

Abstract: The kinetics of scrap tyre pyrolysis has been studied by means of thermogravimetry (runs at constant temperature and following temperature ramps) and using a fast heating microreactor. The advantages of the microreactor for obtaining kinetic data at higher temperatures (in the 773–973K range) than those corresponding to thermogravimetry and under conditions similar to those of continuous large-scale reactor are clearly shown. The validity of the kinetic parameters determined (E =98.6kJmol−1 and k 0 =7.35×104 s−1) will only be restricted by unavoidable heat and mass transfer limitations, which have been minimized by using a particle size smaller than 0.2mm. The kinetic results are evidence, on the one hand, of the limitations of these laboratory techniques for the kinetic study and, on the other, of the inherent heat and mass limitations of this material.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of plastics is a promising technique towards high-value utilization and solvent-free treatment of plastic waste. However, low product selectivity and broad product distribution may restrict the application of plastic pyrolysis. In this study, polyolefins and polystyrene (PS) were converted into methane and carbon spheres through pyrolysis under autogenic atmosphere (AAP). To elucidate the product evolution and reaction mechanism of AAP, product distributions, compositions and properties at 450–700 °C were investigated.

Abstract: This work targets to produce multi value-added products by pyrolysis of hydrochars obtained from co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) of PVC and alkali coal. The hydrochars pyrolysis was carried out with a downdraft fixed bed reactor. The results indicate that HTC promoted the damage of oxygen functional groups, and the fixed carbon content and calorific value were considerably improved after co-HTC. The entire pyrolysis was delayed for coal hydrochar due to the increase of stable compositions in coal structure and improvement of coal rank. Besides, the PVC addition weakened this delay because of its instability, which could be verified by the activation energy. The H2 and CH4 yields increased in syngas, while the CO2 yield was concurrently reduced because of the removal of oxygen by decarboxylation. The obtained H2/CO ratio of syngas from hydrochar pyrolysis ranged from 1.34 to 4.33 depending on the pyrolysis parameters. The tar yield from hydrochar pyrolysis was lower than that of raw coal, which was ascribed to the lower degree of crosslinking in hydrochar facilitating the release of tar. The aromatic degree and rich pore structures of char indicated its great potential for contaminants adsorption which was further confirmed by the malachite green adsorption experiments. These findings could provide comprehensive knowledge on producing multi value-added products (hydrogen-rich syngas, poly-aromatic tar and adsorbent-char) from hydrochar pyrolysis, which would promote the economical utilization of high alkali coal and chlorinated wastes.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with alkali coal and biomass-like feedstock, with no focus on pure plastic oil composition or fingerprint data.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_HYDROGEN;TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Recovering fuels or chemicals from plastic waste via pyrolysis is an innovative and promising route for both energy saving and refuse elimination. In this study, catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was performed to simultaneously improve yield and quality of gasoline-range products. NiO and HY zeolite were respectively used as in-situ and ex-situ catalysts in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis system. The results showed that the optimum pyrolysis and catalysis temperatures were 500 °C and 450 °C, respectively, with 56.53 wt% oil product and 93.80% gasoline-range fraction achieved. The content of high-octane-number compounds, primarily aromatics and isomerized aliphatics, increased from 23.5% to 80.4% as HY to LDPE ratio rose from 0 to 1:5. The optimized balance between oil yield and oil quality was obtained at the HY to LDPE ratio of 1:10. The presence of NiO during co-catalysis slightly decreased the oil yield by 5.3–8.5 wt%. Meanwhile, the production of aromatics was promoted obviously while the yield of normal aliphatics was inhibited, which were both favorable to improve the octane number of the oil product. The improved performance of co-catalysis could be related to the suitable hydrogen abstraction ability of NiO, which produced enormous alkenes.

Abstract: The effect of the addition of a nanocrystalline H-beta zeolite in the pyrolysis of a commercial LDPE has been studied using dynamic conditions in a thermobalance and in a batch reactor, the results have been compared with those obtained using a HZSM-5 zeolite. The H-beta catalyst has an important influence on the decomposition of the polymer even at very low zeolite concentration. Although this mixture has a saturating effect at a certain concentration of catalyst (around 7%), a remarkable effect in the first steps of LDPE decomposition as increasing the catalyst loading has been observed. This important catalytic effect has been attributed to the external acid sites present in the H-beta zeolite. The study of the gaseous products evolved in the catalytic pyrolysis shows the influence of the structure and the temperature on the composition of the gas, and a possible effect of the deactivation of the catalyst. The isobutane/n-butane ratio obtained showed an important variation with temperature and was higher in the gas produced using H-beta than with HZSM-5.

Abstract: This study is aimed at proposing a feedstock recycling approach to make value-added monomer from single-use garment like stocking waste (SW) using incinerator bottom ash catalyst (IBAC). SW is made mainly of nylon 6 (>80 wt%) with minor components such as polyurethane. Thermochemical SW decomposition pathways are identified by evolved gas analysis and single-shot pyrolysis analysis, confirming that caprolactam (a value-added chemical re-used for manufacturing nylon 6) is the major product. IBAC is composed mainly of alkaline metal oxides (e.g., CaO). The use of IBAC in thermochemical SW conversion at 500 °C under CO2 atmosphere increases the yield of caprolactam reaching 70.8 wt% (20 % higher than non-catalytic SW conversion (59.2 wt%)).

Abstract: Natural asphalt cannot be used directly because of hardness and low penetration, so it needs to be softened with a solvent. A solvent that can be used is from oil plastic pyrolysis as an alternative additive. Plastics are now an inseparable item from daily necessities and are the largest pollutant on the environment. Plastic is a polymer that is difficult to be decomposed, and one way to decompose it is through pyrolysis or thermal cracking. This research studies the quality effect of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics waste on the quantity and quality of oil yield produced through the pyrolysis process in the three reactor outlets. LDPE plastics waste used was distinguished: LDPE-White, LDPE Mixed-plastic, and LDPE Blend-plastic. The results showed that, in the process of plastic pyrolysis LDPE, in addition to affecting the yield of produced oil, the quality of plastic is also influenced by the length of time of pyrolysis. The better the quality of the plastic is, the higher the oil yield and the shorter the pyrolysis times are. LDPE plastic pyrolysis at 250 °C produces the maximum yield. Most oil yields, namely 99.78%, 75.60%, and 50.29% were produced by LDPE white plastics, mixed plastics, and blend plastics, respectively, when pyrolyzed for 110, 180, and 270 min.

Abstract: Health-care waste management is a challenge for the health sector. Currently, pyrolysis technologies are being used to treat medical waste that can convert it to a hydrocarbon fuel. In the present study, hazardous health-care waste was pyrolyzed using a continuous tubular fast pyrolysis reactor. Mass balance analysis and formation of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by USEPA as priority pollutants, and was studied during the pyrolysis process in a wide range of operation conditions, i.e., reaction temperature (300–700 °C), residence time (100–190 s) and waste particle size (1–3 cm). Response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were applied to optimize the operating variables. Cracking and decomposition of feedstock occurred almost optimally in 700 °C resulting in the generation of 73.4% liquid and 24.1% char. The PAHs were characterized in significant concentrations in pyrolytic oil (121–29440 mg/lit) and char (223–1610 mg/kg) products. The formation of total USEPA listed PAH components varied by the operating ranges of temperature, residence time and waste size. In the pyrolytic oil phase, the formation of total PAHs was drastically increased by increasing the waste particle size. It is also found that increasing the temperature and having longer residence times have a high influence on the total 16 USEPA PAHs formation rate in the char phase. It is concluded that fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste, as thermal treatment method, would influence the formation and destruction of PAHs and their fraction to a different extent depending on the role of operating variables.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste with no clear plastic feed composition or oil fingerprint data, and focus on PAH formation rather than plastic-specific oil composition.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The conversion of waste plastics into high-value products through catalytic cracking offers a promising solution to plastic pollution. This study developed a novel method to synthesize porous carbon-based catalysts (0.1FeNi-MEC, 0.15FeNi-MEC, and 0.2FeNi-MEC) loaded with iron-nickel bimetallic nanoparticles using rapid, energy-efficient microwave pyrolysis with biomass as a sustainable precursor.

During biomass pyrolysis, iron and nickel ions facilitated pore expansion and were in-situ reduced to Fe3Ni2 nanoparticles, uniformly anchored on the porous carbon skeleton. The oil yield from polypropylene and polystyrene pyrolysis decreased with increasing temperature, with styrene and small-molecule oils (e.g., toluene) dominating below 600 °C. At 600 °C, the 0.2FeNi-MEC catalyst achieved a carbon nanotube yield of approximately 30% from polystyrene pyrolysis, with carbon nanotube diameters mainly around 40 nm, while polypropylene pyrolysis yielded about 20% carbon nanotubes.

The results revealed that the increase of PS mixing ratio increased the interaction of the co-pyrolysis volatiles, which raised the tar and light aromatic hydrocarbons yield. Especially for the mixing ratio of coal/PS being 7:3, the content of styrene and ethylbenzene in tar is 31.5 % and 15.2 % higher than the theoretically calculated value, respectively. Moreover, co-pyrolysis promoted the interaction between volatiles to produce biphenyls such as 1,3-diphenylpropane.

Abstract: The Ru dispersion of Ru/SBA-15 was controlled by varying the triethanolamine (TEA)/Ru molar ratios to examine the influence of Ru structures on the hydrogenolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) under moderate conditions (3 MPa hydrogen and 250 °C). Among the different Ru catalysts tested, Ru/SBA-15 with a TEA/Ru molar ratio of 10 (Ru/SBA-15 (10)) exhibited the best activity in LDPE hydrogenolysis. Analyses, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO chemisorption, CO Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and High-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) showed that the optimal amount of TEA (TEA/Ru = 10) increased the Ru dispersion (92%) and ultimately improved the catalytic activity of LDPE hydrogenolysis. The addition of TEA led to the formation of a [Ru(triethanolamine)2]3+ complex, which facilitated the introduction of Ru species into the confined space in SBA-15. The highly dispersed Ru species confined within SBA-15 in Ru/SBA-15 (10), along with the inherent properties of SBA-15, results in increased hydrogen coverage on the Ru species. This increase in hydrogen coverage leads to a higher liquid yield in LDPE hydrogenolysis compared to Ru/SiO2 (10).

Abstract: Multilayer composite packaging plastic is commonly used in daily life. Due to the complex structures and the existence of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, the recycling of this kind of plastic is challenging. Recycling through the pyrolysis method may provide an efficient option with respect to the mechanical and solvent methods. An understanding of the behaviour of heteroatoms during pyrolysis is significant to optimize the operating conditions. In this work, two composite packaging plastics of PET/LDPE (Polyethylene Terephthalate/Low Density Polyethylene) and PA/LDPE (Polyamide//Low Density Polyethylene) were pyrolysed at various temperatures between 400 and 500 °C in a fixed bed reactor. Heteroatom balance and composition analysis were conducted. Especially, the composition of O- and N-containing compounds in oils was fully understood by using GC-MS (Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer) and APPI FT-ICR MS (Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer) instruments.

Hydroreforming experiments were carried out at 310°C under 20bar of hydrogen. All the catalysts were synthesized with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 30 and a Ni content of 7wt%. According to XRD, TPR and TEM data, the activated catalysts displayed Ni particles both over the external surface and inside the catalyst pores in different percentages depending on their porous structure and nature. Complete hydrogenation of the olefins was observed over both mesostructured catalysts (Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni/Al-MCM-41) and hierarchical Ni/h-Beta. In contrast, over Ni/h-ZSM-5, there is always left about 30% of olefins, due to an imbalance in the acid and metal function. Ni/h-ZSM-5 led towards significant amounts of gases (∼18%) while gasoline range hydrocarbons were the main products (55%) over Ni/h-Beta, at the expense of diesel fractions. In contrast, the hydrocracking extent was far lower over Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-SBA-15, the latter showing additionally the appearance of a slight degree of oligomerization, which led towards an increase in the heavy diesel fraction (C19–C40). Hydroisomerization reactions also occur, mostly in the case of Ni supported hierarchical zeolites. Likewise, aromatics were formed over these catalysts in a large extent.

Abstract: Inexpensive iron-based catalysts are the most promising catalysts for microwave pyrolysis of waste plastics, especially a large number of disposable medical masks (DMMs) with biological hazards produced by spread of COVID-19. However, most synthesized iron-based catalysts have very low microwave heating efficiency due to the enrichment state of iron.

Results showed that chlorine was mainly distributed in pyrolysis char (42.36–65.29 %) and gas (26.66–35.03 %) after MSW pellets pyrolysis.

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the world saw an exponential surge in the production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, which eventually got discarded in the biomedical waste stream. In this study, thirteen different polymer samples from the PPE kit were collected and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, thermogravimetric analysis, and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry. The characterization data showed that about 94 % by mass of components were made of only three polymers, viz. polypropylene (PP, 75.6 wt %), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 12.5 wt %), and polycarbonate (PC, 6 wt %). The analytical pyrolysis of the PPE coverall suit (PP) yielded mainly alkenes containing 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene as the major compound with 17 wt % yield at 600 °C. The pyrolysates from face shield (PET) were rich in benzoic acid (5.8 wt %) and acetophenone (4.8 wt %), while those from safety goggles (PC) were rich in phenol (17.6 wt %) and p-cresol (12.4 wt %) at 600 °C. HZSM-5 and HY zeolites were used for the catalytic upgradation of pyrolysates especially from PP, PET and PC.

Abstract: The search for cleaner and renewable energy sources coupled with the need for environmental protection has necessitated the conversion of municipal solid wastes to energy sources. In this study, the pyrolysis of waste tyres in a fixed-bed reactor was carried out in a bid to generate non-condensable gases. The influence of process variables such as sample weight, reaction temperature, and reaction time were modelled and optimized using the central composite design of the response surface methodology.

The strong acidity of NS-Z5 sample results from its high crystallinity and few framework defects benefiting from the introduction of seeds. The catalytic evaluations both in batch and in thermogravimetric reactors demonstrate the important roles of the accessibility and strength of acid sites on low-density polypropylene cracking.

Abstract: Plastic-fluidized bed interaction has been investigated by non-invasive X-ray imaging techniques in the temperature range of 500–650 °C and under pyrolysis conditions. Experiments were conducted by feeding a single polypropylene particle using either overbed or underbed feeding methods. The fluidized bed was operated from minimum fluidization conditions to bubbling regime, up to 2Umf. Interestingly, experimental observations show that the understanding of the mixing/segregation behaviour of polypropylene in a hot fluidized bed does not appear to be as straightforward as in the case of more conventional feedstocks, such as biomass. Further analysis and an alternative point of view to investigate the complex behaviour observed for plastic feedstock have been provided. The interaction between the fluidized bed and a single polypropylene particle was modelled by means of an axial segregation model, and a physics-assisted stochastic approach. In the second case, it was possible to simulate the formation of the sand-plastic agglomerate (incipient agglomeration stage) and the evolution of its density over time. The models were then validated by means of axial segregation data obtained via X-ray imaging techniques and by measuring the physical properties of real sand-polypropylene agglomerates produced within the bed operating at high temperatures.

Abstract: Current disposal of end-of-life plastics by landfilling or incineration raises serious environmental concerns, simultaneously representing an irretrievable loss of valuable resources. Especially this is evident for materials that have a complex structure, like polyurethane foams. In this work, co-pyrolysis with sawdust was carried out to analyze and evaluate the product quality for further utilization as alternative fuels. The introduction of polyurethane increased the oil yield but in a limited range since no significant difference was observed between the mixture with 25 and 75% of polyurethane content. In addition, the chemical analysis showed that small addition of polyurethane is sufficient to eliminate most of the oxygenated compounds derived from sawdust. Nevertheless, the obtained liquid products are mostly benzenamines that do not meet the criteria for fuel composition. Analysis of the synergistic effect shows that the strongest impact is visible for a small branch of plastic content where liquid yield was promoted at the expense of gas. With a further increment of plastic content, this effect fades away, except for the solid residue where remains constant.

Abstract: Metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW) is the most complex fraction of plastic waste ever.

Within this frame, this research aims to study the volatile products released from pyrolysis of MFPW and their kinetics by using the TG-FTIR/GC–MS system. The experiments were performed on six different types of MFPW (potato chips, chocolate, bakery, coffee, and biscuits) and its mixture. The developed strategy started with analysis of the selected MFPW samples and the proximate analysis showed that the samples were rich with volatile matter content (till 99.5 wt%). In parallel, DMCHA dissolution treatment was used for preliminary experiments to determine the total number and types of plastic layers in MFPW confined to EVA, PET, and LDPE. Afterwards, the TG-FTIR system was used to investigate the thermal and chemical degradation of the MFPW samples up to 900 °C at different heating rates (5-30˚C/min), while the GC/MS system was used to study the volatile products generated from MFPW samples at the maximum decomposition temperatures (467-485˚C). Finally, the model-free methods (Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa, and Friedman) were used to develop the kinetic model of pyrolysis of the MFPW samples. The results showed that the main decomposition of the MFPW samples happened in the range 360-500˚C with mass loss of 67–96%, while the kinetic models indicated that the mean activation energies for the mixture sample were estimated at 288.8 kJ/mol (Kissinger), 287.8 KJ/mol (KAS), 314.5 KJ/mol (FWO), and 307.9 KJ/mol (Friedman).

Abstract: The pyrolysis of waste packaging plastic was performed in a semi-batch reactor to study the effect of the shape of reactant on the compositions of pyrolysis oils under N2 gas inflow conditions. Bundle and fluffy shapes of reactants were pyrolyzed at 400 °C for 90 min at N2 inflow rates from 0 to 300 mL/min. The yields of pyrolysis oils were between 67.7 and 76.1% under the reaction conditions, and diesel-like middle oil (C11–C22) was mainly produced with mass fractions over 64%. The main oil product was mostly composed of n-paraffin and n-olefin compounds, and its mass fraction was considerably influenced by the reactant shape and the N2 flow rate. The pyrolysis of the fluff reactant exhibited higher middle oil fractions with higher fraction ratios of n-paraffins to n-olefins than the bundle reactant.

Abstract: A catalytic reactive distillation reactor, previously described, was improved to increase the production of middle and heavy hydrocarbons, to be used as feedstock or fuel in the viewpoint of a Circular Economy of plastics. The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were run using high density polyethylene (HDPE) under several experimental conditions, with a 1 % (w/w) of HZSM-5 for catalytic pyrolysis. Three different temperatures were tested in each case and the influence of the reaction time was evaluated at 500 °C and 430 °C for thermal pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, respectively. Thermal pyrolysis of HDPE produced the higher amount of solid products (80 %wt. or higher) under the form of a waxy cream-colored material (wax) for all the experimental sets. For catalytic pyrolysis, the major product fraction was always liquid. The analysis of the liquid products showed that, for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, the products obtained were within the range of C5 to C11, with a higher yield on C8 and C9 in the case of thermal pyrolysis and on C6 and C7 for catalytic pyrolysis.

Abstract: This work is a preliminary study for the development of a co-pyrolysis process of plastic wastes excavated from a landfill and used lubrication oils, with the aim to produce an alternative liquid fuel for industrial use. First, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out with pure plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) and oils (a motor oil and a mixture of used lubrication oils) in order to highlight the interactions occurring between a plastic and an oil during their co-pyrolysis. It appears that the main decomposition event of each component takes place at higher temperatures when the components are mixed than when they are alone, possibly because the two components stabilize each other during their co-pyrolysis. These interactions depend on the nature of the plastic and the oil. In addition, co-pyrolysis experiments were led in a lab-scale reactor using a mixture of excavated plastic wastes and used lubrication oils. On the one hand, the influence of some key operating parameters on the outcome of the process was analyzed. It was possible to produce an alternative fuel for industrial use whose viscosity is lower than 1Pas at 90°C, from a plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction between 40% and 60%, by proceeding at a maximum temperature included in the range 350–400°C. On the other hand, the amount of energy required to successfully co-pyrolyze, in lab conditions, 1kg of plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction of 60% was estimated at about 8MJ. That amount of energy is largely used for the thermal cracking of the molecules. It is also shown that, per kg of mixture introduced in the lab reactor, 29MJ can be recovered from the combustion of the liquid resulting from the co-pyrolysis.

Abstract: Catalytic cracking of plastics waste to produce fuel is increasingly gaining the attention of researchers worldwide. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of temperature and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on composition of liquid products from catalytic cracking of LDPE dissolved in benzene. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed. The catalytic cracking produced C1C8 hydrocarbons in all runs due to the effective heat exchange between polymer chains and catalysts. Analysis of products composition indicated that catalytic cracking of LDPE generally produced high amount of aliphatic branched-chain compounds, together with moderate amount of cyclic compounds. The reaction conditions also led to alkylation of benzene by the cracking products from LDPE. Hence, it is concluded that the catalytic cracking of LDPE is dominated by free radical mechanism, while the influence of carbenium ion is less pronounced due to low acidity of the catalyst. Overall, it is shown that catalytic cracking of LDPE solution in fixed bed reactor produced higher polymer conversion and liquid yield than conventional reactors and has the potential to extract hydrocarbon energy from recycled polymer waste.",YES,YES,LDPE single-polymer pyrolysis with GC-MS-like oil composition data and detailed liquid product analysis.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis can potentially convert plastic waste to olefins, moving a step further towards a circular economy. This study explores an in-situ two-step continuous catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to light olefins. The 1st step consists of the thermal pyrolysis of LDPE and the subsequent conversion of pyrolysis vapour to olefins over a Mn/Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that Mn(10 %)/Al2O3 catalysts are beneficial for producing maximum light olefins (∼60 wt% of gas), while Ni(10 %)/Al2O3 is inherently more hydrogen-selective (∼17 % of gas) at 450 °C. This is due to the higher dehydrogenation ability of Mn in comparison to Ni. The yield of olefins in gaseous products reached up to 61.4 %, and that of gases in the overall product was 63.5 % during in-situ catalytic pyrolysis over Mn(5 %)/Al2O3 at 450 °C.

Abstract: Hydrogen, viz. a green energy carrier, is poised to considerably contribute to the empowerment of a sustainable society. By valorizing plastics, catalytic pyrolysis was envisaged as a promising route to produce green hydrogen and value-added product here. Firstly, the screening of optimal catalyst support (from activated carbon and four zeolites: M-zeolite, B-zeolite, Y-zeolite, ZSM-5) was executed by studying catalytic polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis over supported Ni catalysts. In view of the highest H2 yield (19.2 mmol/gPP) of Ni/ZSM-5, ZSM-5 was put forth as the optimal catalyst support. Then, the identification of optimal active metal (from Ni, Fe, Co, FeNi, FeCo, and NiCo) was performed by running the catalytic PP pyrolysis over ZSM-5 supported catalysts. For catalytic PP pyrolysis, NiCo/ZSM-5 was the optimal catalyst with the highest H2 yield (28.7 mmol/gPP), while the resulting pyrolysis oil demonstrated potential for use as jet fuel. From catalytic pyrolysis of various plastics over NiCo/ZSM-5, polystyrene gave the highest H2 composition (83.2 vol%) of pyrolysis gas and high composition (52.8 area%) of benzocyclobutene (useful chemicals for semiconductor and microelectronics fields) in pyrolysis oil. Lastly, the catalytic mechanism was discussed based on the results, revealing NiCo's remarkable enhancement in H2 yield to 28.7 mmol/g, which surpassed the individual yields of Ni (19.2 mmol/g) and Co (10.2 mmol/g), thereby underscoring the synergistic effect of NiCo.

Abstract: In this work, a new concept of an energetically self-sustaining pyrolysis reactor, C-DPyR, is presented as an alternative to transforming polyethylene waste into wax. TGA and DSC were used to characterize the wax regarding thermal behavior among the recovered materials and perform kinetics computations. ATR-FTIR identified the functional groups constituting the waxes. The experiments that reached great thermal energies resulted in a high amount of gas produced, on average of 74 wt%, confirming that pyrolysis’s heat was more than sufficient to crack the samples. A maximum of about 87 wt% of wax was recovered from an experiment that made 80 kJ of energy available for pyrolysis. It was assumed that the wax degrades through overlapped reactions associated with the main functional groups forming the wax and identified by FTIR. DSC curves evidenced one endothermic valley, 80 J/g, and one exothermic peak, 2115 J/g. The FTIR established the functional wax groups composed mainly of C-H, CH2, and CH3, the same groups present in the FTIR spectra of LDPE. Using isoconversional methods, the wax pyrolysis’s single-step and multi-step kinetic analyses were performed to determine the kinetic triplets.

Abstract: Pyrolysis combined with dry reforming (PCDR) is eco-friendly technology for plastic waste management, allowing for sustainable production of syngas. Design of suitable catalysts with high performance and stability is crucial for its industrialization. In this work, Ni-Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized using organic–inorganic precursors. Three types of amines (hexylamine – aliphatic linear, cyclohexylamine – aliphatic cyclic, aniline – aromatic) were used as carbon source in the precursor preparation to investigate their effect on catalyst physicochemical properties and its catalytic performance. Catalytic performance of the obtained catalysts was examined in PCDR of model waste plastic mixture. It was revealed that catalytic activity of catalysts prepared with aliphatic amines was higher compared to aromatic aniline, amine commonly used for carbide synthesis. The differences in catalyst properties, which affected their catalytic activity were characterized using N2-adsorption at −196 °C, XRD, H2-TPR, SEM, TG/DTG and CO2-adsorption methods. A correlation was observed between amine molecule complexity and Mo2C crystallite size, significantly affecting hydrogen generation. The less complex the amine, the smaller the crystallite and the increased hydrogen production. Moreover, the use of aliphatic amines resulted in the stronger Ni-support interactions, the increased number of more favorable, larger mesopores as well as the presence of the metallic Mo phase and the lack of unbound carbon in contrast to the catalyst obtained using aniline.

Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) with an annual growth rate of 3–5% is one of the fastest-growing waste streams.

Abstract: The instability of liquid oils issued from the pyrolysis of plastics usually leads to the degradation and the deterioration of their different properties. In this study, the stability of oils produced from the pyrolysis with and without reflux of polypropylene (PP) was investigated in a standard test device called PetroOxy. This work compares the stability of PP liquid oils with kerosene throughout their induction period and hydroperoxide (ROOH) content, two well-known stability parameters. Moreover, experimental investigations of the impact of a stabilizer (BHT = butylated hydroxytoluene) on the same stability parameters were achieved. A titration method and GC-MS were used to quantify ROOHs and to identify the oxidized liquid compounds, respectively. PetroOxy tests with BHT showed an enormous influence of BHT on the oxidation stability compared to all other oxidative tests. Adding 500 ppm of BHT multiplied the induction period by 5.9, 4.3, 10.7 and 6.7 for reflux liquid oils, no-reflux liquid oils mixed with kerosene, reflux liquid oils mixed with kerosene and pure kerosene respectively. The ROOH concentration was divided by up to 16.9 for reflux liquid oil when BHT was used. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the liquid oils obtained by pyrolysis with reflux are less stable than without reflux, and both of them are less stable than kerosene used as reference model. But using kerosene as solvent mixed with liquid oils obtained by pyrolysis with and without reflux increases their oxidative stability.

Abstract: The goal of this work is to analyze the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the pyrolysis of either high density polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) matrices by using both kinetic thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under non-isothermal conditions and a fixed-bed reactor under isothermal conditions. Under non-isothermal conditions, CNTs increased the beginning of thermodegradation for both matrices with differences as high as 30 °C and 22 °C as compared with neat PP and PE, respectively. This enhanced thermal stability in PP based composites was associated with an increase in the apparent activation energy whereas in PE based composites lower pre-exponential factors associated with reduced conformational entropy, are responsible for the enhanced thermal stability. The thermodecomposition processes were studied by assuming geometrical contraction and nucleation models. The invariant pre-exponential factor and apparent activation energy obtained were quantified for each sample confirming that these values depended on the polymer matrix and concentration of CNTs. These invariant parameters were in good agreement with those obtained by isoconversional analyses allowing the prediction of the thermogravimetric behavior. Our findings clearly showed the strong effect of CNTs on the non-isothermal pyrolysis of polymer materials changing its kinetic and the activation energy.

Abstract: The extensive utilization of plastic in daily life has significantly contributed to per-day waste generation. The conversion of waste plastic through pyrolysis into fossil fuel is a promising solution to waste management and energy crises. The precise control of the process parameters in the pyrolysis would be a sustainable business model. Since the optimization of process parameters for production yield and the physicochemical properties of waste plastic oil have been underexplored. So, the current research optimized input process parameters of pyrolysis through response surface methodology using a central composite design. The input parameters of the experimental design were reaction temperature (350°C-550°C), retention time (60–300 min), nitrogen flow rate (0–40 ml/s), and ZSM-5 catalyst concentration (1–5 wt%). Waste plastic is converted into the optimized yield of oil (85 %), solid (3 %), and syngas (12 %). Waste plastic oil (WPO) had optimal results of physicochemical properties like heating value (48 MJ/kg), flash point (60 °C), kinematic viscosity (2.1 mm2/s), and density (820 kg/m3).

Abstract: The pyrolysis-catalytic decomposition process has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing plastic pollution by upcycling plastic waste into high-value carbon nanomaterials (CNMs). Traditional biochar-based catalysts face challenges in CNMs yield and carbon species. This study introduces Ni- and Fe-loaded biochar catalysts synthesized via hydrothermal (HT) treatment for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen production. The Ni/BC-24HT catalyst at 800 °C achieved the highest CNT yield (608 mg/gPS) and H2 selectivity (80.5 vol%, 23.1 mmol/gPS), surpassing wet impregnation (WI) catalysts and overcoming biochar’s limitations in CNT production. HT synthesis enhances inherent metal dispersion by replacing native minerals through ion exchange, effectively purifying the biochar catalyst by removing inherent metals while simultaneously incorporating the active metal onto the support, thereby improving catalytic performance. Ni and Fe3C in spent catalysts confirm CNT growth via surface/interface diffusion for Ni/BC-24HT and bulk diffusion for Fe/BC-24HT, explaining the higher CNT yield in Ni-loaded catalysts.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to produce pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) in a pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor. The influence of various reaction parameters, such as temperature, feed rate and the kind of fluidizing medium, was investigated. The maximum oil yields were about 87wt.% (474°C) for the HIPS and 84wt.% (525°C) for the ABS. A higher feed rate and the use of product gas as a fluidizing medium were favorable for the oil production. The oils produced from the HIPS pyrolysis consisted chiefly of toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, cumene, α-methylstyrene and styrene dimers and they appeared to be usable directly as a fuel or chemical source. Main compounds of the ABS pyrolysis oils were similar to those obtained from the HIPS, except for nitrogen-containing compounds.

Abstract: The tri-pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE ), cornstalk (CS ) and anthracite coal (AC ) was performed using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The pyrolysis and kinetic characteristics of the raw feed materials (PE, CS and AC ) along with selected mass blend ratios was investigated and compared. The tri-pyrolysis process for the selected mass blend ratios is characterised by three distinct stages, which is sequentially dominated by cornstalk CS , polyethylene PE , and anthracite AC . It was found that the activation energies representing the tri-pyrolysis process are different with respect to the activation energies associated with the individual raw feed materials. It is observed that for any given fixed mass blend ratio of PE as the contribution of CS is increased the initial decomposition temperature at which tri-pyrolysis takes place is significantly lowered to <190 °C. Therefore, the increased addition of CS is considered to enhance the tri-pyrolysis process. An increase in the mass blend ratio of AC resulted in higher yields of pyrolysed residue. The yield of tri-pyrolysed residue accounted for up to 40 wt% when the mass blend contribution of AC was ≥0.5. Activation energies of <130 kJ mol−1 for the suite of mass blended materials was determined with little variation in the actual EA’s between the respective mass blend ratios. The tri-pyrolysis reaction is thought to be more stable than the pyrolysis of the individual raw feed materials and it is further suggested that a synergy between the respective feed materials exists during the tri-pyrolysis process.",NO,NO,"The study focuses on tri-pyrolysis of plastic with biomass and coal, without reporting liquid/oil composition or yield data.",NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA;CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: The polymer's physico-chemical property is reinforced by incorporating an aromatic molecule into the polymeric backbone. However, the persistence of aromatic plastics poses potential hazards against the liberation of toxic compounds. To address this issue, this work proposes a functional use of CO2 for the pyrolytic conversion of highly aromatised plastics, polyimide, into carbon-based materials while mitigating the toxic aromatic formations. Characterisations of polyimide clarified its exact type and pyrolysis mechanism. Polyimide pyrolysis yielded ≥ 60 wt.% of the char formation. Its surface functionalities revealed superior performance in CO2 adsorption than the reference materials. However, the production of polyimide-derived adsorbent inevitably generates toxic chemicals. To impede the toxic aromatic formations, CO2 was chosen as a detoxifying agent. The toxic chemicals liberated from polyimide can be converted into gaseous fuel, CO. This functional role of CO2 was improved in the presence of a nickel catalyst. CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis led to a 97.7% degradation in toxic chemicals, subsequently resulting in a 3.14-fold increase in CO formation. Therefore, the CO2-mediated pyrolysis provides insights into the sustainable valorization of aromatic plastic waste into CO2 adsorbent, simultaneously addressing the environmental issues related to the generation of toxic aromatic pollutants.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on CO2 adsorbent production from polyimide pyrolysis with emphasis on toxic byproduct suppression and CO generation, not on oil composition or liquid product fingerprinting.",TARGET_CNT;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The conversion of waste polyolefins into valuable products like hydrogen and nanocarbon offers a promising pathway for waste management and resource recovery. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis using coal flyash (FA) and nickel-impregnated flyash (Ni-FA) as catalysts. Coal flyash, rich in Al2O3 and SiO2, serves as a sustainable and low-cost support for Ni impregnation, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Characterization using TPR, XRD, and FESEM confirmed effective dispersion of Ni on the surface of flyash. The catalysts were then used during pyrolysis of LDPE, HDPE, and PP in a fixed-bed reactor. Ni-FA catalyst yielded 60–75 vol% H2 as compared to 25–60 vol% obtained using FA alone. The nanocarbon structures formed on the Ni-FA catalysts were predominantly multi-walled carbon nanotubes with diameters ranging from 10 to 60 nm, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, and HRTEM. The findings indicate that Ni-FA is a cost-effective and sustainable catalyst, leveraging industrial waste material to address both plastic pollution and the growing demand for H2 and nanocarbon.

Abstract: The mechanism for the formation of gaseous products, especially hydrogen, from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires by using Ni-based catalysts has been studied.

The study revealed that with the incorporation of 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, the relative content of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires can be significantly improved by about 41.3 % in comparison to the same measurement done in the absence of the catalyst. Kinetic and thermodynamic simulations for the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires were also performed and the corresponding energy barriers and Gibbs free energy changes were calculated. Accordingly, the optimal reaction path for the hydrogen production was determined by comparing and analyzing the values of those parameters.

Abstract: This study approaches the continuous catalytic fast pyrolysis of plastics in a flexible and original technology, i.e., a conical spouted bed reactor equipped with fountain confiner and draft tube. The catalyst is an inexpensive equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) one. Moreover, operation under oxidative conditions is proposed to solve heat supply to the pyrolysis reactor, as a previous study revealed a remarkable difference in the performance of the cracking catalyst when pyrolysis was carried out under inert (conventional) and oxidative conditions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the role played in the catalyst stability and deactivation mechanism by the presence of air in the reaction environment.

Abstract: Polyurethanes (PUR) are versatile polymers used in a broad range of applications. Conventional mechanical recycling is thus difficult. Chemical recycling such as pyrolytic waste treatment presents new recycling options. Advanced recycling by pyrolysis may help to reduce environmental impacts from PUR wastes. The knowledge of mechanisms, products and yields is essential for the design of efficient pyrolysis processes. Rigid (RPUF) and flexible foams (FPUF), a cast elastomer (CE) and a thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) have been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and FTIR-spectroscopy. Two decomposition steps have been identified. CO2 is mainly released in the first decomposition step between 250 °C and 400 °C. The second decomposition step at temperatures above 400 °C releases polyol fragments and marginal amounts of CO2. Strong feedstock dependency is evident. Quantitative tracing for the CO2 release was developed, validated and applied. This allows the resolution of specific decomposition phenomena, mass balancing and distinguishing potentially valuable volatiles from CO2 and solid residues. CO2 yields are 12.0 mass-% for RPUF, 4.0 mass-% for FPUF, 3.2 mass-% for CE and 5.3 mass-% for TPU.

Abstract: Catalytic co-conversion of Kraft lignin (KL) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) over mesostructured catalysts was examined using a micro-pyrolyzer equipped with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (MPy-GC/MS/FID). Mesoporous catalysts of Al-SBA-15 and mesoZSM-5 were synthesized and characterized by N2 sorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption, and X-ray diffraction. The characterization results indicated that mesoZSM-5 had the smaller average pore size (4.10 nm) than Al-SBA-15 (10.70 nm), but its total acidity (both weak and strong acid sites) was much higher than Al-SBA-15. When they were applied as catalysts in the pyrolysis of KL and LLDPE, the mesoZSM-5 exhibited higher catalytic activity for aromatic hydrocarbon production due to its higher acidity and MFI pore structure. Indeed, synergistic synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons was achieved via the catalytic co-pyrolysis of KL and LLDPE because of the H-donating effect of LLDPE; the experimental yields (GC/MS area; abundance vs. time) of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oils obtained from catalytic co-pyrolysis of KL/LLDPE (1:1) over Al-SBA-15 (8.76 × 107) and mesoZSM-5 (27.58 × 107) were ∼1.5 fold higher than the theoretical yields.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with biomass (Kraft lignin) and no separate condition for pure plastic oil composition data.,CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The treatment of antibiotic fermentation residue (AFR) is a global environmental challenge due to its hazardous nature. Pyrolysis is a promising technique for harmless treatment of AFR, achieving simultaneous detoxification of waste and energy recovery. However, the pyrolysis of AFR is hindered by low hydrocarbon content and excessive generation of N/O-containing byproducts in the bio-oil. This study developed an innovative co-pyrolysis strategy for Vancomycin fermentation residue (VFR) with waste plastics, such as waste polyolefin plastics (polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and low-density polyethylene (LDPE)), to synergistically enhance the quality of bio-oil through hydrogen supplementation while suppressing the generation of N/O-containing byproducts. The results showed that, compared to mono-pyrolysis of VFR, the co-pyrolysis increased the gas yields by 24.58 %, with the yields of CH4 and C2+ gases increasing by 42.96 % and 284.77 %, respectively. More importantly, the bio-oil yield increased by 34.97 % while drastically reducing the contents of oxygen (87.50 %) and nitrogen (83.41 %).

The added plastics significantly reduced the content of N/O-containing functional groups of the char. The mechanism analysis attributed the synergy to radical-mediated interactions where plastic-derived alkyl/hydrogen radicals inhibited Maillard reactions through hydrogen transfer and conversion of oxygen species, ultimately suppressing the formation of N-products.

The experiments have been performed under N2 atmosphere at several heating rates, and the results obtained showed that, from the quality of the FTIR data obtained, the higher heating rates produced the best results. The evolution of the spectrograms obtained along the pyrolysis process reveals two events of generation of volatile products, related to the stages of EVA decomposition already described in the bibliography. On the other hand, the TG and Gram–Schmidt curves show the existence of two different stages for the second step of the pyrolysis of EVA, which can be associated to the decomposition of the different domains which appear in the polymeric chain after the first decomposition step. The interpretation of the FTIR spectrograms corresponding to the temperatures of maximum decomposition rate for each decomposition step shows the formation of acetic acid, CO and CO2 in the first decomposition step (elimination of the acetoxi groups), and the formation of a complex hydrocarbon mixture in the second decomposition step (cracking of the polymeric chain) including alkanes, alkenes and mononuclear aromatic compounds.

Abstract: Plastic waste is an increasing economic and environmental problem as such there is a great need to process this waste and reduce its environmental impact.

The experimental work was carried out using packed bed reactor operating under an inert atmosphere at 450°C. Different reactor bed materials, including sand, cement and white clay were used to enhance the thermal cracking of HDPE. In addition, the catalytic effect of sodium hydroxide, HUSY and HBeta zeolite catalysts on the degradation of HDPE waste was also investigated. The reactor beds were found to significantly alter the yield as well as the product composition. Products such as paraffins (⩽C44), olefins (⩽C22), aromatics (⩽C14) and alcohols (C16 and C17) were obtained at varying rates. The highest yield of liquid (82%) was obtained over a cement powder bed with a paraffin yield of 58%. The yield of paraffins and olefins followed separate paths, for paraffins it was found to increase in the order or Cement>White clay>Silica Sand, whereas for the olefins it was in the reverse order Silica Sand>White clay>Cement.

Abstract: This study compares the performance of autogenous pressurized pyrolysis (P-PYR) and low-pressure hydrothermal liquefaction (LP-HT) for transforming low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into gasoline-range and diesel-range hydrocarbons. Both processes were carried out in a closed reactor, at temperatures from 350 to 450 °C. The effect of ZSM-5 zeolite as a catalyst was also analyzed. The evaluated parameters included the amount of the gas, oil, and wax fractions formed; the chemical composition of the gas and liquid fractions; and the simulated distillations (SIMDIS) of the liquid fractions. The distillation curves obtained by SIMDIS were used to estimate the yield of gasoline range and diesel-range hydrocarbon fractions. In the non-catalyzed processes, all the products had nearly the same composition, indicating that water had a limited effect on the depolymerization process. In the catalyzed processes, there was a slight change in the yield of the recovered products when water was present. The ZSM-5 zeolite also had an impact on the chemical composition of the produced fractions. Without the catalyst, both LP-HT and P-PYR (at 400 °C) produced about 40 % gasoline-range and 25 % diesel-range hydrocarbons, leading to a total yield of fuel-range hydrocarbons of around 65 %. When the ZSM-5 catalyst was used, the recovered oil mostly contained single-ring aromatic compounds, leading to a fuel yield of around 44 % (at 375 °C), with gasoline-range hydrocarbons making up 36–38 % and diesel-range hydrocarbons 6–8 %. The results indicate that ZSM-5 zeolite can alter the makeup of the thermochemical products from LDPE, and at the experimental conditions studied, water only had a limited effect.",YES,YES,LDPE pyrolysis with ZSM-5 catalyst and detailed oil composition and fuel-range distribution data from SIMDIS and GC-MS analysis.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: Mechanical recycling of mixed packaging waste has limitations due to challenging separation into pure polyolefin streams which often leads to low quality recyclates. A solution to improve overall recycling rates of polyolefins is chemical recycling. One promising approach is conversion into a liquid product via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking of the pyrolysis oil towards light olefins. In this study, distilled fractions of pyrolysis oils from PE and PP-rich waste were characterized via GC × GC including normal and reversed-phase column configurations with a special focus on oxygenated components. Distilled pyrolysis oils were subsequently steam cracked in 20/80 weight‐based blends with conventional naphtha. All pyrolysis oil samples contained substantial amounts of oxygenates (1–10 wt%) which poses a huge challenge for steam cracker feedstocks and it was found that ketones are the most prevailing oxygenate group. Steam cracking experiments showed slightly increased ethylene yields of the blends compared to pure fossil naphtha, with the PE-derived samples outperforming the PP-derived samples. Furthermore, diesel-range distillation cuts led to higher formation of heavy products compared to the naphtha-range cuts. Increased formation of CO was observed as a consequence of the substantial oxygen contamination which can be a deal-breaker in industrial steam crackers. This work shows that distilled pyrolysis oils with conventional naphtha are promising steam cracking feedstocks if intermediate processing steps are performed to remove the oxygenates and other impurities using, for instance, hydrotreatment. With the findings of this work, such upgrading processes can be designed in a more effective way.",YES,YES,PE and PP single-polymer pyrolysis with detailed GC × GC oil composition data including oxygenate profiling.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: This study investigates new developments of thermal catalytic pyrolysis using transition metals (Fe2+, Fe3+) supported on ZSM-5 zeolites applied to a feedstock originated from the food court areas which can be considered representative for Municipal Solid Waste(MSW).The catalytic pyrolysis runs were performed using a two-stage process configuration: thermal pyrolysis conducted at 500 °C followed by catalytic cracking of vapors. The vapor catalytic upgrading was done ex-situ by using three types of catalysts HZSM5, Fe2+HZSM5, and Fe3+HZSM5 at 300, 350, and 400 °C. The structural features inherent of the ZSM-5 zeolites and associated properties (e.g. very regular microporosity, stability, ion exchange capacity) during pyrolytic processes, as well as the ability to accommodate chemical modification via isomorphic substitution of the tetrahedral atoms in the crystal network in presence of transition metals, make them unique catalysts scavengers. This new route can be applied to target the pyrolytic process for Food Court Waste (FCW) selective conversion and obtaining valuable intermediaries for different industries. The addition of catalysts was shown to enhance FCW decomposition at lower temperatures. The most important result observed in the pyrolysis process was obtained over Fe2+ZSM- 5 which was found to be the most efficient catalyst for waste minimization leading to high bio-oil conversion (∼40 wt% at 350 °C).

Abstract: In this study, iron was used to modify pyrolytic activated carbon (AC) to synthesize a bifunctional catalyst (Fe/AC). It was applied to the catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin with polypropylene (PP) for the preparation of jet fuel range hydrocarbons. Relationships between iron loading, reaction temperature, catalyst/feedstock ratio, and lignin/PP ratio were investigated in connection to the yield, component distribution, carbon number distribution, and chain structure of pyrolysis products. The results indicated that the hydrocarbons with carbon numbers in the jet fuel range dominated the products obtained from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin and polypropylene. Owing to the oxytropism of Fe3 + , the selectivity of oxygenated chemicals in pyrolysis oil decreased as the Fe loading rose. Consequently, the production of hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range was increased. Furthermore, the deoxygenation and alkylation reactions of phenols to high-carbon aromatics were facilitated by Fe3 + . The cyclization and dehydrogenation reactions were promoted with the reaction temperature increased, thus enhancing the selectivity of cyclic hydrocarbons (cycloalkanes and aromatics) in the jet fuel range. However, secondary reactions were boosted with the excessive temperature, reducing the yield of hydrocarbons and the percentage of high-carbon hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range. The reduction of the proportion of oxygenated compounds was facilitated by the use of catalysts. Thus, the selectivity of hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range was improved, but the yield of high-carbon hydrocarbons would be reduced. In addition, the cleavage of PP-derived chain hydrocarbons was promoted by the hydrogen abstraction reaction of lignin-derived oxygenates during co-pyrolysis. The hydrogen transfer reaction between hydrocarbons and phenols was enhanced, it was pushed for phenols to convert to aromatics. Thus, the yield of hydrocarbons in the range of jet fuel was improved.

Abstract: Disposable plastic cup has been expensively used in our daily life due to its versatility, usability, and affordability. However, the mass increase in plastic cup waste (PCW) becomes detrimental environmental issues because the current plastic disposal process could be a vector for microplastics and hazardous compounds. In this study, an environmentally benign disposal and valorization process of PCW was suggested. In particular, pyrolysis of PCW was performed using a greenhouse (CO2) as a reaction medium. The thermal degradation of PCW produced hazardous benzene derivatives because PCW was made of polyethylene terephthalate. The harmful aromatic compounds (benzene derivatives) were detoxified by means of syngas production (H2 and CO) in the presence of a Co catalyst. Effects of CO2 and Co catalyst resulted in conversion of more than 95 % of toxic chemicals, benzene derivatives, into syngas at 700 ˚C. CO2 also effectively suppressed a deactivation of Co catalyst because gas phase reactions between CO2 and benzene derivatives mitigated (hydro)carbon formations that can be deposited on the catalyst surface. Thus, this study proposed that CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis is a promising approach to convert disposable plastic container and CO2 into value-added products with mitigation of harmful chemical production.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on detoxifying harmful aromatic compounds and syngas production, with no reported oil composition or liquid product data.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;TARGET_AROMATICS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: World plastic production has increased since industrial-scale production began in the 1940s and while large amount of thermoplastic polymers can be effectively recycled and re-used, undifferentiated polymers or thermoset polymers cannot, and as a result, most of these raw materials end up in landfill or energy recovery in incinerators.

In particular, novel carbon materials, could translate into interesting and cheap material for the catalytic reduction of oxygen (ORR), a fundamental reaction for the production of H2O2 or in fuel cell and metal air batteries. This paper presents the synthesis of iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) electrocatalysts starting from a mix of polyethylene (PE) and polyurethane (PU) by adding FeCl3 as an iron source for promoting Fe-Nx sites formation. The two polymers were mixed according to a solvent assisted process employing p-xylene or with a solvent free process using a Brabender plastograph. The blend of thermoplastic and thermoset polymers was converted into Fe-N-C materials in a two-step pyrolysis, where the temperature of second pyrolysis showed to sensitively affect the chemical and textural properties of the resulting material. Depending on the temperature, and initial PE content, the surface area ranges between 195 and 479 m2 g−1, with a preferential formation of micropores.

Abstract: Great efforts have been applied in order to achieve the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites through post-synthesis alkaline treatment. In this case, the use of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites as acid catalysts in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins overcomes some diffusional limitations and expands the selectivity of products. Thus, the purpose of work was to promote a secondary porosity in ZSM-5 zeolite by NaOH treatment (using conventional electric and microwave heating methods), applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as pore-directing agent. Both heating methods generated additional secondary porosity, with microwave heating promoting a narrow pore size distribution, when compared to conventional. All hierarchical ZSM-5 have been showed low-density polyethylene conversions superior to the purely microporous ZSM-5, however the hierarchical zeolite processed by conventional electric heating reached the higher temperature reduction (42.6 K).

Abstract: Pyrolysis of plastic mixtures has shown to form complex mixtures of oil, which is difficult to predict. Interaction effects between plastics have shown to affect both the oil composition and the yield distribution of oil, char, and gas. This work aims to generate models for the prediction of oil and char yield, acid number, and viscosity based on the feed composition. Besides the oil composition based on the reactor feed was mapped. Pyrolysis was performed in a batch reactor with a mixture of PP, PE, EVA, PET, PS and PA, where the content of PET, PS and PA were varied from 0% to 15%. The developed models showed a decrease in oil yield of 10% when 15% PS was interchanged with PET. Char content, acid number, and viscosity were shown to increase with the content of PET and lowered with the content of PS. PA caused an increase in char yield and viscosity, while it did not affect the acid number. The models R2-values varied from 0.87 to 0.96, showing that most of the variation in the responses can be explained by the differences in feed composition. The oil composition was found to mainly consist of hydrocarbons (C10 +), naphta and aromatics with only a small precense of alcohol and acid.

Abstract: Catalytic hydrocracking on supported metal zeolites promisingly converts waste plastics into more valuable hydrocarbons. Although the presence of metal sites on solid acids is typically considered necessary for C-C bond cleavage of alkanes at modest temperatures, we show that polyethylene (PE) depolymerization on metal-free MFI zeolites proceeds at higher rates than analogous metal-loaded MFI zeolites (Pt, Ni) under mild reaction conditions. Higher rates on metal-free MFI are consistent with higher ratios of alkenes to alkanes, leading to subsequent alkene-mediated beta-scission events that form smaller molecules. Under varied reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, H2 versus N2), both metal-free and metal-loaded MFI catalysts demonstrate high selectivity to C3-C7 gaseous hydrocarbons, likely due to the 10-MR channel structure. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of deconvoluting metal and acid sites contributions for PE hydrocracking, which has significant implications on rates and product selectivities of plastic upcycling reactions.",YES,NO,"Main target is C3-C7 gaseous hydrocarbons, with no focus on liquid/oil product composition or yield.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Different types of waste plastics, consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were co-pyrolysed with the waste tires using a fixed bed batch pyrolysis reactor. The main gases produced from the individual plastics and tires were hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, butane, and butene, whereas PET produced mainly carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. GC/MS analysis of the product oil produced from tire pyrolysis were mostly aromatic compounds produced from the rubber components of the tire. For HDPE, LDPE and PP pyrolysis, the oil produced was of mainly aliphatic composition, PS pyrolysis gave a considerable portion of single ring aromatic and polycyclic aromatic compounds and PET formed mainly oxygenated compounds and aromatic compounds.

Abstract: Catalytic conversion of waste polyolefins to value-added alkylaromatics could contribute to carbon recycling. Compared with tandem hydrogenolysis/aromatization of polyethylene (PE) catalyzed by Pt/γ-Al2O3 at 280°C, both a 5-fold enhancement in the rate of C–C bond scission and a doubling of the molar yield of alkylaromatics were achieved using a more acidic Pt/F-Al2O3 catalyst instead.

Because physical mixtures of weakly acidic Pt/γ-Al2O3 or non-acidic Pt/SiO2 with strongly Brønsted acidic Cl-Al2O3 or F-Al2O3 are also effective, the tandem reaction does not require nanoscale intimacy between metal and acid active sites.

Abstract: Thermochemical recycling of medical plastic waste (MPW) was evaluated experimentally and through development of mass & energy balances. Fluidized bed (FB) steam cracking of MPW at a centralized petrochemical site was compared to thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of MPW to intermediate WAX (thermal) and POil (catalytic) feedstocks at a decentralized site, followed by FB steam cracking of WAX and POil at a centralized petrochemical site. Pyrolysis and FB steam cracking experiments were performed in lab-scale reactors. Steam cracking yields of primary products (light olefins, C2-3 alkynes, BTXs) were highest for MPW, followed by WAX, and POil feedstocks. Higher steam cracking temperature increased the primary product yields for the MPW feedstock but showed a less significant effect in WAX and POil cases. For all cases, higher cracking temperature increased chain scission and hydrogen abstraction, resulting in rising yields of ethylene, methane, and hydrogen, and lower yields of longer chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. Material, carbon, and energy balances, developed from experimental results, showed that excess heat from incineration of pyrolysis and steam cracking byproducts can meet the energy demands of the pyrolysis and steam cracking processes. The balances also showed that direct FB steam cracking of MPW can achieve high product yields and high rates of fossil carbon recycling.

Abstract: The production of added-value chemicals via pyrolysis of plastic wastes, such as those from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), needs addressing their usual contamination with halogens (mainly Br and Cl). This work compares the conversion via pyrolysis and hydropyrolysis of a real WEEE plastic, having a complex composition, in two different reactor configurations: down-flow (DF) and up-flow (UF). Likewise, the effects of incorporating a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and using two different pressures (1 and 6 bar) have been assessed. With the DF mode, pyrolysis at 1 bar leads to an oil yield above 80 wt% and a total halogen content of about 600 ppm (vs 1600 ppm in the water-washed WEEE plastic). Under DF catalytic hydropyrolysis at 6 bar, this high oil yield is maintained while its dehalogenation degree is improved (142 ppm). Operating with the up-flow configuration, under 6 bar and H2 presence, leads to some reduction in the oil yield (about 70 wt%) but significantly decreases the oil halogen content (55 ppm Cl and total elimination of Br). These results have been related to the slower pyrolysis and longer residence time in the thermal zone of the UF configuration, which favours the halogen-trapping effect of the char fraction, and the pressure-enhanced hydrodehalogenation activity of the catalyst.

Abstract: The current high volume of plastic waste, but low recycling rate, has led to environmental pollution and wasted energy.

In this work, the pyrolysis properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and Py-GC/MS. The effect of the pyrolysis atmosphere, using N2 or CO2, with various MCM-41 catalyst ratios on pyrolysis product distribution, were investigated. The experimental results show that the olefin selectivity under a N2 atmosphere was from 30.32 % to 44.66 % which increased as the MCM-41 catalyst was increased. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the olefin selectivity reached a maximum of 60.39 %. The Boudouard reaction was also enhanced by the introduction of CO2. The carbon content of the subdivided olefins showed that in CO2, the promotion of C5-C12 olefins was relatively weak when non-catalyzed or at low catalytic ratios, but increased significantly at higher MCM-41 catalyst ratios.

Abstract: The main objective of this work was to study refuse-derived fuels (RDF) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) upgrading by pyrolysis of blends of these materials with wood. The study considered three operational conditions: cracking temperature, heating rate, and different wt.% of RDF and HDPE. The results demonstrate that the cracking temperature of 500 °C and the faster heating rates increased the liquid yield for RDF blends. On the other hand, HDPE blends favor gas production at 550 °C and faster heating rates, which enhance the process operativity because polymeric materials generate waxes and are reduced beneath such conditions. Finally, produced gas LHV increases as RDF and HDPE were added. For example, the LHV of the produced gas only with wood at 550 °C and 20 °C/min was 10.34 MJ/m3 and with 25 wt% HDPE was 14.82 MJ/m3.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass, no pure plastic oil composition data, and oil is not the main focus.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Catalytic co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass pine sawdust (PSD) under sludge fly ash (SFA) could be a breakthrough towards the energy challenges and waste management. This paper aims to develop a unique cobalt-alkali-SFA (Co-A-SFA) catalyst, in order to investigate its influence under optimal operating conditions in a fixed bed reactor for syngas production. The catalytic activity was assessed under different Co loading and support ratios. The results indicated that in the presence of Co-A-SFA catalyst, gas production increased due to alkali pretreated fly ash catalyst. Moreover, increasing the Co loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, the syngas production increased irrespective of the individual feedstock ratios. Under catalytic conditions of 5 and 10 wt% the H2 yield to 25.4% and 28.3% for 50/50 MSW/PSD compared to 11.5 wt% under no catalyst. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of MSW and PSD also minimized the concentration of complex liquid compounds and heavy hydrocarbons. Therefore, this study establishes a new approach towards energy production and sustainable waste management through useful resource utilization of MSW, PSD and SFA.

Abstract: The accumulating amounts of long-life plastic wastes simultaneously with the global emerging need to discover alternative energy sources, have both increased the importance of plastic pyrolysis-based refineries. This study was devoted to examine the effectiveness of municipal plastic wastes recycling into a potential source of hydrocarbon fuel. Thermoplastic wastes of polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), high-density and low-density polyethylene (HDPE) (LDPE), were converted into a combustible oil via semi-batch pressurized thermal (Th-PP) and catalytic pyrolysis (Cat-PP) in a fixed-bed reactor. During Th-PP, the recovered amounts of oil were (67.6 % −89.25 %) in the order PP > LDPE > HDPE > PS. Moreover, it was shown that 77.5% of the PP pyro-oil was in the range of gasoline fraction (C6 – C12) with maximum iso-paraffins of 12.52% compared to other plastic pyro-oils. The Cat-PP process, involved the catalytic cracking via a Ni-Mo-w/zeolite-based catalyst (Z-503).

Abstract: Valorisation of post-consumer plastic pyrolysis oil in steam crackers and their application as precursors to chemicals is currently hindered by the complexity of these oils in terms of their boiling range, the risk of fouling by unsaturated compounds, and the presence of contaminations (heteroatoms, metals, and halogens). To gain insights into which of these challenges is actually a potential showstopper, we have studied the vacuum distillation of pyrolysis oil derived from two sorted post-consumer waste plastics, i.e. polypropylene (PP) rigids and mixed polyolefins (MPO) rigids, in a batch fractionating column. The crude pyrolysis oil samples were distilled in three fractions i.e., the light fraction (final boiling point 360 °C). Subsequently, comprehensive characterisation, such as physicochemical properties, the level of contaminations, and chemical composition, was performed. The suitability of the light and middle fractions for steam cracking and precursors to chemical feedstock was assessed. It was found that the density and viscosity values of light and middle fractions from the two pyrolysis oil samples were comparable to fossil naphtha and diesel, whereas total acid number (TAN) values were notably higher compared to petroleum-based oil fractions (>0.5 mgKOH/g). Analyses via GC-MS and ATR-FTIR revealed predominant concentrations of olefins. ICP-OES analysis showed that distillation removes more than 97.5% of metals in all fractions. The chlorine content (>3 ppm), nitrogen (≥0.1%), and oxygen (≥0.1%) exceed thresholds. Hence, this study shows that vacuum distillation effectively improved most, but not all, of the properties of the distilled fractions and can thus be an essential downstream process step for the application of post-consumer plastic pyrolysis oils as feedstock in steam crackers and precursors to chemicals.",YES,YES,PP and mixed polyolefins pyrolysis with detailed GC-MS and ATR-FTIR oil composition data after vacuum distillation.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;DEFINED_PLASTIC_MIX;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: Pyrolysis of plastic waste has emerged as a strategic measure to produce liquid fuel, expanding applicability in internal combustion engines under controllable equivalence ratio. However, a difficulty in the precise control of hydrocarbon (HC) chain lengths in the liquid fuel still restricts its reliable utilization. To produce more combustible fuel, transforming plastic waste into gaseous fuels may be more viable approach. This study thus investigated a pyrolytic conversion of plastic waste, plastic bag waste (PBW), into syngas while leveraging carbon dioxide (CO2) as a partial oxidative agent. Pyrolysis of PBW generates a broad spectrum of HCs, which are unsuitable as transportation fuel. However, introducing CO2 enabled its interaction with PBW-derived pyrogenic HCs, partially shortening their carbon chain lengths. A nickel (Ni) catalyst was introduced to accelerate the reaction kinetics to govern the functional reactivity of CO2. Peak intensities of pyrogenic HCs were notably reduced, with effective conversion into CO-rich syngas, contributing to the enhanced carbon availability and suppressed CO2 emission within the proposed pyrolysis system. Catalytic pyrolysis was conducted under diverse temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) and CO2 concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 80 vol% CO2) to optimize the mechanistic reactivity of CO2. For a practical evaluation, the resulting CO-rich syngas was simulated in a gas turbine cycle model for power generation. The thermodynamic variables were determined using the syngas compositional matrix and then used to estimate gas turbine performances including work output and thermal efficiency. The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycle was significantly enhanced when utilizing CO-rich syngas produced from CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis, demonstrating more than two-fold increase compared with commercial natural gas.",YES,NO,Main focus is on CO-rich syngas production with no meaningful oil composition or yield data reported.,TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: In this study, the co-pyrolysis of camphorwood and low-density polyethylene employing a cascade catalyst system consisting of CaO and Zn-modified HBeta in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated for the production of aviation fuel hydrocarbons (C8–C16). The effect of Zn loading on HBeta, CaO to Zn/HBeta mass ratio, and the feedstock to catalyst mass ratio on both oil yield and composition was investigated. Results revealed that loading Zn onto HBeta led to ZnO cluster and oxygen-bridged Zn dimers ([ZnOZn]2+) formation, which affects HBeta's acid properties and aromatization capacity. The 10 wt%Zn/HBeta catalyst with more ZnO content exhibited weak acid sites, and moderate aromatization capacity, increasing oil yield from 32.06 to 44.25 wt% compared to 3 wt%Zn/HBeta and favoring presence of straight-chain components in oil products. CaO also enhanced straight-chain alkane formation. The highest oil yield, reaching 48.44 wt%, was obtained when CaO and 10 wt%Zn/HBeta cascade by a 1:1 mass ratio was adopted, producing oil with aviation fuel with a maximum yield of 18.45 wt%, and selectivity of 38.09 area%, of which 26.54 area% being aromatics and 11.55 area% being alkanes. Furthermore, the feedstock-to-catalyst ratio influenced the products significantly, with lower feedstock-to-catalyst ratio enhanced aromatization and the ratio of 2:1 recommended.

Abstract: The production of plastic waste is increasing rapidly. Landfilling and incineration, as common recycling methods, are no longer sufficient to meet environmental protection requirements. Therefore, plastic pyrolysis has attracted widespread attention. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are both typical components of waste plastics. Due to the overlap in their application fields, they often coexist in the collected waste plastics. Therefore, co-pyrolysis of PVC and PET plastics appears to be more valuable for research. This study was conducted based on thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and their combined techniques. It was found that when PVC and PET are mixed, the stage II of the pyrolysis reaction of PVC plastic is enhanced, and the yield of aromatic organic substances in stage II of the co-pyrolysis reaction of the mixed plastic significantly decreases. Due to the insufficient ability of the traditional KAS method in analyzing the kinetics of complex multi-step reactions, this study combines the mathematical method of Gaussian peak fitting with the KAS method, and fits the TG curve of plastic pyrolysis into a multi-stage reaction curve with peaks, and conducts independent analysis. Compared with single-component plastics, the average apparent activation energy of PVC-PET mixed plastics is lower, and there is a synergistic effect between the pyrolysis reactions of the two plastics. The energy demand of the mixed plastics co-pyrolysis reaction is more stable, which is conducive to the stable operation of the equipment in industrial production and reduces energy loss.

Abstract: Biodegradable plastics (BP) have undergone rapid development in the field of replacing traditional packaging plastics. However, their recycling and disposal systems are unclear, and the standards are different, causing new environmental pollution. The rapid and appropriate disposal of BP has become a worthy direction of exploration. Here, rapid pyrolysis technology was used to explore the recycling of BP, and the product evolution and transformation mechanism of typical BP (BP1∼BP4) were analyzed. The results show that the main reaction stages of BP pyrolysis are concentrated at approximately 260∼450 °C. Most of the heat treatment stages of BP conform to the random nucleation and nuclear growth model An (n = 1.5, 2, 2.5. 3). The gaseous products of BP pyrolysis were mainly 1, 3-butadiene. The top four pyrolysis components are the same for the liquid products of BP1, BP2, and BP4, which are mainly benzoic acid (42.54%–44.67%). However, the proportion of polycyclic aromatic substances in the products of the BP3 pyrolysis solution was as high as 63.85%. For the transformation mechanism, BP containing polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene terephthalate-adipate (PBAT) is mainly composed of C–O bond fractures at the ester group and intramolecular hydrogen transfer to form a carboxyl group and CC.

Abstract: Introducing Ni into ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts stands as an efficacious strategy for augmenting catalytic activity in the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Thermal reduction using H2 serves as a customary approach to convert Ni2+ species to Ni0, bolstering the catalytic efficacy in aromatics conversion. However, thermal treatment is prone to precipitating the agglomeration of Ni metal, leading to a diminution in the active sites of the catalyst. Therefore, this work focused on the effect that arose from different reduction temperatures on the PP catalytic thermal degradation process. According to the analysis of the reduced Ni-modified ZSM-5 catalysts, the size of Ni particles loaded onto the ZSM-5 support progressively increased with escalating reduction temperatures, ranging from 21.7 to 30.5 nm. Excessive size hindered the conversion of Ni0 which played a key role in the acid properties. Moreover, it was discovered that the H2 yield and aromatics proportions increased linearly with the strong acid amount and total B/L ratio, respectively. By contrast, the modified catalyst treated at 500 °C displayed superior catalytic performance. Additionally, coke generation was favored by the enlarged size of Ni particles.

Abstract: The increasing population and by extension the plastic waste increasing rate requires innovative waste management mitigation solutions, especially for a challenging polymer such as polystyrene. However, the presence of a broad range of contaminants in its waste stream, cellulose-based contaminants being one of the most prevalent, hinders polystyrene recycling. Herein, a microwave co-pyrolysis of polystyrene and cellulose was carried out to recycle styrene as monomer and to investigate the synergy between both reactants at 500°C. Polystyrene pyrolysis presented a high styrene yield of 0.355g styrene/g polystyrene; while as the cellulose content increased, higher amounts of hydrogen are produced, leading to the hydrogenation of styrene into ethylbenzene and other styrenic derivatives such as 1,4-Diphenyl-2-butene and 1,3-Diphenyl-1-butene. A noticeable 29% decrease in styrene yield was observed for an equal amount of polystyrene and cellulose. At the same conditions, the detrimental effect of the co-pyrolysis also involved the reduction of the oil yield, from 58.9%, polystyrene pyrolysis, to 30.2%.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic polymers is becoming an important method for the conversion of plastic materials into valuable chemicals and fuel production. The effect of calcination temperature on cerium loaded on oil palm ash (Ce/OPA) catalyst and products in catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE plastic were studied. The catalysts were synthesized via wet impregnation method and calcined at 500 °C, 750 °C and 1000 °C. The surface morphology and surface structure of the catalysts were also analyzed. The catalytic pyrolysis was done in a batch reactor at 450 °C with 15 mL.min−1 of N2 and 10:1 of plastic-to-catalyst weight ratio for an hour. The liquid products of the pyrolysis were analyzed via mass spectrometry GC-TCD, GC–MS, FTIR, bomb calorimeter and viscometer. It is found the Ce/OPA catalyst that calcined at 500 °C for four hours showed better catalytic pyrolysis activity and has largest specific surface area (10.77 m2.g−1) and and pore volume (0.032 cm3.g−1) than the catalyst that calcined at 750 °C (4.52 m2.g−1 and 0.029 cm3.g−1) and 1000 °C (3.70 m2.g−1 and 0.006 cm3.g−1). The Ce/OPA catalyst that calcined at 500 °C catalytic cracked the HDPE waste with less solid yield (25.2 wt%) and more gas yield (18.40 wt%).

Abstract: A hierarchical structure with mesopores was developed around zeolite crystals by zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement (ZDGSR) method where a reinforcing agent composed of hexamethyldisiloxane and acetic anhydride was reacted with HY-zeolite crystals directly. The effects of changing the hydrothermal condition on the development of hierarchical structure of catalysts were examined.

Abstract: Plastic-based insulation materials have been widely employed owing to their exceptional durability, cost-effectiveness, low weight, and low thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, the disposal of the insulation material waste (IMW) within construction waste and its recycling and recovery are challenging. Meanwhile, landfilling or incineration methods can release toxic chemicals into the environment. Consequently, the accumulation of IMW in construction waste has become a pressing environmental concern. To address this issue, this paper proposes a pyrolysis platform as a disposal management method for IMW that employs CO2 as a reactive medium. IMW composed of polystyrene in the form of extruded polystyrene underwent pyrolysis to yield pyrogenic products containing toxic chemicals. These toxic chemicals were subsequently transformed into syngas via homogeneous reactions with CO2 under certain thermal conditions and Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. This resulted in a significant reduction in the total peak areas of toxic substances in the pyrogenic oil compared with that obtained using N2 as a medium. Furthermore, the efficacy of CO2 was demonstrated to increase with an increase in the atmospheric concentration.

Abstract: Mulch films support crop growth and food security by conserving resources, yet spent films contribute to microplastic pollution, posing disposal challenges. Pyrolysis offers a promising way to recycle these films, often mixed with soil and organic residues. This study explores thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of spent mulch films (over HZSM-5 zeolite), to assess reaction kinetics and product distribution. Characterization of fresh and spent films showed minor physical degradation and slight oxidation in the latter. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed similar thermal degradation patterns for both film types, though HZSM-5 reduced the peak temperature by 40–60 °C, with a more marked reduction in the mass loss rate for spent films. Kinetic analysis using a single-step model indicated that HZSM-5 lowered the activation energy from 144.5 kJ mol−1 to 89.8 kJ mol−1, underscoring its catalytic effect.

Abstract: Dioxins reduction is crucial for the pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW). In this work, torrefaction was employed as a pretreatment for inhibiting the synthesis of dioxins. A mixture of poplar and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was used as the model MSW and provided the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) source and chlorine sources, respectively. A torrefaction-pyrolysis experiment was performed in a tubular furnace system, and the weight loss and chlorine release (mainly in the form of hydrogen chloride) were evaluated. The dioxins distribution in the products were detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) was employed to clarify the chlorination of PAHs. The results showed that torrefaction could reduce 98.63 % of the total amount of dioxins and reduce 99.09 % of the toxic equivalent of volatile dioxins. Since torrefaction cut the Cl participation of MSW (from PVC) by 86.94 %, the overall reaction process was simplified, and the temperature of the maximum conversion rate was increased. In addition, the analysis of the functional groups indicated that most dioxins during pyrolysis was synthesized from 200 ℃ to 400 ℃ .

Abstract: The rapid increase in marine waste has resulted in the accumulation of plastic marine debris (PMD), which is of concern to the scientific community due to the need for its safe disposal worldwide. PMD primarily consists of non-degradable polymeric waste, namely thermoplastics, which contain a substantial amount of energy as they are made from petroleum-based sources. Proper disposal and energy reclamation of this waste have become pressing topics. This study aimed to investigate PMD through thermogravimetric analysis followed by pyrolysis in the temperature range of 450–600 °C. Additionally, two catalysts, 10% nickel impregnated activated alumina (10% Ni/Al2O3) and sodium aluminosilicate (AlNaO6Si2), were incorporated (non-contacting method) to evaluate their effect on product yield and quality. During the non-catalytic process, the highest yield (∼78%) was achieved at a temperature of 550 °C while the presence of a catalyst had a minimal effect on oil density (0.74–0.76), and the percentage yield decreased to ∼ 58 and ∼ 62% using AlNaO6Si2 and 10% Ni/Al2O3 at 550 °C. The catalyst had a significant effect on the fraction of oxygenated compounds in the oil, reducing it by ∼ 18% from the non-catalytic process. AlNaO6Si2 resulted in a higher fraction of gasoline-range compounds, while 10% Ni/Al2O3 showed a higher similarity towards diesel fractions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis identified the presence of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, alcohols, and other compounds in the oil product, with variations observed depending on the catalyst used. The results showed that among all hydrocarbons, propane had the maximum fraction, followed by ethane, methane, and butane in the gaseous compounds.

Abstract: The huge scale of plastic waste generation and its environmental consequences drive the demands for catalytic plastic upcycling processes. Here, we report efficient polypropylene (PP) hydro-conversion over Ru and Ni supported on a sol-gel anatase TiO2 (TiO2-A-SG). A small number of Brønsted acid sites on TiO2-A-SG enables hydrocracking, improving efficiency, steering the selectivity towards high-valued C4–20, and allowing more isomerization, compared to Ru-based monofunctional hydrogenolysis catalysts. The relative contribution of hydrocracking increases with lower hydrogen partial pressure, more branched substrates, and lower Ru loading. Ni/TiO2-A-SG exhibits superior hydrocracking activity and selectivity to Ni on conventional Brønsted-acidic supports, particularly zeolites. Mechanistic studies shows fast isomerization and sequential β-scissions caused by strong polymer-catalyst interaction and fast cracking with abundant 3C.

Abstract: Plastics like high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), and Polypropylene (PP) constitute a large portion of municipal solid waste. Plastics can be pyrolysed for reuse, but the end-product qualities are critical to industry refining processes. Pilot-scale pyrolysis and vacuum distillation were used to thermally degrade the plastics and convert it to petrol (gasoline) and diesel. Batch pyrolysis of HDPE, PS, and PP at 540 oC yielded plastic pyrolysis crude oils. The crude oil was separated into different fractions starting with distillation temperatures of less than 170 OC, 170 to 380 °C, and above 380 °C. The quality of the produced crude oil, gasoline, and diesel cuts was evaluated analytically according to the fuel specifications. This study demonstrated that pyrolysis of plastics can convert up to 80% of solids by weight) into liquid crude oil. HDPE pyrolysis produces lower quantities of oil due to the production of wax. A high calorific value (38.1 to 42.9 MJ/kg) similar to fossil fuels indicates that the liquid product of plastic pyrolysis could be a viable energy source. Plastic pyrolysis crude oil from PS mostly yielded gasoline at around 70% by weight, while HDPE and PP yield predominantly diesel at more than 50% by weight. The distilled oil characterisation results were outstanding, confirming that the quality of produced petrol and diesel from plastics pyrolysis oil suppress minimum specifications for automotive fuel standards. The cetane index of HDPE and PP diesel was found to be 60 and 55 respectively, significantly above the required value of 46 for automotive diesel. Higher heating values of most petrol cuts were in the range of 41.1 to 44.6 MJ/kg. These and other fuel qualities are within or near the approved range for automotive fuel.

Abstract: The pyrolytic liquid and gas products are extensively analyzed for practical applications, but, few applications exist for solid product from waste plastics pyrolysis. This study investigates energy storage potential of waste plastics-derived carbon nano-materials (CNMs), pyrolyzed directly on nickel foam (NF) coated with nickel alumina catalyst, in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Effect of increasing nickel to aluminum molar ratio (0.05, 0.1, 0.2) in energy storage capacity is studied. Galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, at 0.125 A g−1, show highest specific capacitance of 153.75 F g−1 for 0.1 molar ratio. The reason for such high performance is mainly because of a) greater metal-support interaction by using NF substrate, b) formation of CNMs according to base-growth mechanism, providing metal free surface at the top, and c) the presence of equal amounts of disordered and ordered carbons, resulting in meso- and micro-porous structures, providing high electrolyte availability at the electrode surface.

Abstract: Plastics, integral to various human activities, have led to a surge in production, posing substantial challenges in waste management. The persistent non-biodegradability of plastics, taking over a century to decompose, necessitates exploration into technologies for their conversion into sustainable fuels. Pyrolysis, an oxygen-free thermal decomposition process, emerges as a promising avenue for producing liquid fuels from plastic waste. This study's primary objective is to create and validate an Aspen Plus simulation model, enabling techno-economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis of pyrolysis for converting waste plastics into liquid fuels. Critical parameters—temperature, retention time, and particle size—are examined for their impact on product yield and quality. The methodology involves model development, validation, and subsequent simulations with various waste plastic types under different pyrolysis conditions.

Abstract: To recover syngas from waste plastics (Low-density polyethylene, LDPE) and CO2 simultaneously, the advanced continuous microwave pyrolysis and in situ reforming of CO2 were used. The ability of CO2 to tune LDPE carbon reallocation was evaluated, as was that of CO2 to directionally control the H2/CO ratio. The CO2 utilization efficiency and energy balance were quantitatively analysed, and the mechanism through which CO2 controlled H2/CO ratio was explored via experimental results and density functional theory calculations. The results showed that increasing pyrolysis temperature from 450 °C to 650 °C and introducing CO2 changed the carbon reallocation ability, increased syngas content, and controlled H2/CO ratio. The pyrolysis gas yield and syngas content reached the maximum values of 96.44% and 66.61 vol%, respectively. However, introducing excessive CO2 led to the double waste of resources and energy due to side reactions and high energy consumption.

Abstract: Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been synthesized by means of a method involving a precrystallization stage to form the protozeolitic units, the addition and subsequent grafting of both silanization and alkoxylation agents, and a final hydrothermal crystallization. The influence of the alkoxylation with different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and n-butanol) on the properties of the final hierarchical ZSM-5 samples has been investigated. In every case, the alcohol addition increased the incorporation of the seed silanization agent as it decreases the gel viscosity. In addition, the presence of alcohols deeply affects the physicochemical properties of the final materials. The samples prepared with 2-propanol and methanol were highly crystalline and presented improved textural properties with regard to the reference h-ZSM-5 and n-ZSM-5. In contrast, the samples obtained with ethanol and n-butanol were partially and totally X-ray amorphous, respectively. 1H and 13C-CP solid state MAS NMR spectra proved the alkoxylation of the external surface of the protozeolitic units. Catalytic cracking of LDPE pointed out the higher TOF values obtained over the hierarchical samples prepared with methanol and 2-propanol due to a right combination of accessibility and crystallinity in these materials.

Experimental results showed that the char-volatiles interactions altered the yield and the chemical structure of PP-oil and biochar.

Large aromatic rings in the biochar were predominant during the cracking of the tarry materials in PP-volatiles, while the O-containing species dominated during the recombination and polymerization of the waxy material in PP-volatiles. At higher temperatures, waxy and tarry materials released H-radicals inside the cellulose-char matrix, and strengthened the ring aromatic condensation reactions, while waxy and tarry materials were involved in heavier aromatic structures in lignin-char, leading to the fragmentation of lignin.

Abstract: Metallized food plastic packaging waste (MFPPW), as found in packaging bags like potato chips and coffee, presents an intricate structural and compositional complexity, rendering its recycling considerably more challenging in comparison to pure plastic packaging. In this work, a process route to produce monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) from caustic (NaOH) treatment MFPPW through microwave pyrolysis coupled with ex-situ catalytic reforming was proposed. NaOH pretreatment disrupted the chemical bonds between the plastic layers and aluminum layer, reducing the complexity of the subsequent pyrolysis reaction. The removal of the aluminum layer diminished its shielding effect on the microwave, and enhanced the efficient conversion of the microwave energy into heat energy, thus accelerating the pyrolysis of the remaining plastic. After pretreatment, the activation energy for the pyrolysis reaction decreased from 250.55 kJ/mol to 189.70 kJ/mol, and the MAHs content of the liquid oil increased. The highest MAHs content of 80.50% was achieved with an HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 50) zeolite catalyst, pyrolysis temperature of 550°C, and catalysis temperature of 550°C. The unique characteristics of the MFPPW demonstrate its suitability for MAHs production. MFPPW is predominantly composed of PP and PET polymers. PP, as a hydrogen-rich plastic, provides abundant hydrogen-rich free radicals to the PET and promotes hydrogen transfer reactions, thus facilitating the formation of MAHs.

Experimental results from the blends were then compared with the weighted value calculated from their component feedstocks to quantify the degree of synergistic effect. TG results showed that the co-treatment of PP and PS enhanced the respective devolatilization process. The co-pyrolysis of PP and PS enhanced their thermal cracking, leading to synergistic increases in the yields of H2, light hydrocarbons (HC) and total syngas. In co-gasification, the reforming reaction involving CO2 was synergistically enhanced, resulting in the increased yields of H2 and HC. The gasification reactivity of carbon black improved during the co-processing of PP and PS due to the synergistic effect between the two different kinds of plastics. Higher synergistic effects were observed from the plastic mixtures having higher PS content that resulted in increased yield of syngas. Co-gasification of PP-PS blends having 40% PP content (2P3S) exhibited the maximum synergistic effect on H2, CO, and total syngas showing increased yields by 88.8%, 77.7%, and 74.2% respectively. The lowest synergistic effect was observed for HC that showed increased yield of only 25.1%. The optimal CO2 consumption was also observed from the co-gasification of 2P3S. Each gram of 2P3S feedstock consumed approximately 1.80 g of CO2 to result in highest recovered energy of 27.49 kJ/g and the maximum overall energy efficiency of 43.2%. The results revealed that enhanced thermal cracking and CO2 reforming reaction, along with the improved reactivity of carbon black were mainly responsible for increased yields of H2, HC, CO and total syngas during co-gasification.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and low-rank coal provides a promising method for high-efficiency utilization of them. Previous studies about co-pyrolysis of plastic and low-rank coal mainly concentrated on evenly physical mixture (PM) of feedstock. It has been found that the uneven distribution of materials in the reactor could be caused by the apparent differences in density and property between plastic and coal. In order to investigate the effects of interaction strength between coal and plastic on the thermal behavior and properties of products, a set of co-pyrolysis experiments with different charging methods of one Chinese low-rank coal and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were carried out. To be specific, the charging methods of PM and layered placement (LP), which include charging coal on top of plastic (CT), plastic in the middle of coal like a hamburger (HB) and plastic on top of coal (PT). Results show that, with the same plastic addition ratio, the weight loss of LP co-pyrolysis has almost no reduction compared with that of PM and only one peak is observed from DTG curves instead of two peaks as shown in the theoretical calculated (Cal) curve. It means that there is still an obvious interaction between coal and plastic during co-pyrolysis. Compared to the charge of PM, the tar yield of LP co-pyrolysis decreases slightly while enhances the char yield. The properties of char samples of LP show no noticeable differences as compared that of PM. In term of tar products, co-pyrolysis with HDPE increases the H/C atomic ratio of tar from 1.286 to 1.480 compared to coal pyrolysis alone. However, charging methods make little difference in H/C atom ratio of tar in co-pyrolysis reactions, which is around 1.50. On the other hand, the content of heavy components in tar obtained from LP co-pyrolysis reduces obviously, which is 18.06%, 22.83% and 26.76% for CT, HB and PT, respectively, compared to 36.60% for that of PM. Simultaneously, LP co-pyrolysis can effectively reduce the molecular weight of tar. Additionally, compared to the PM case, the content of H2 and light hydrocarbons (CnHm with n < 5) of LP co-pyrolysis decrease from 10.70% to 7.59% and from 24.56% to 21.67%, respectively. This results from the more effective utilization of H element in the feedstock, especially with the charge of CT. Thus, charging the coal on the top of plastic is a promising method of improving the quality of tar.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with low-rank coal, no pure plastic-only condition or usable oil composition data reported.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: In this study, the microwave-assisted pyrolysis coupled with ex-situ catalytic reforming of polyethylene for naphtha range hydrocarbons, with low aromatic content, was investigated. Experimental results revealed that ZSM-5 zeolites with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios led to high aromatic selectivity, while an extremely high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio significantly reduced the aromatic selectivity. The high selectivity of C5-C12 hydrocarbons (98.9 %) with low selectivity of C5-C12 aromatics (28.5 %) was obtained over a high silica ZSM-5 zeolite at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, catalytic cracking temperature of 460 °C, and a weight hourly space velocity of 7 h−1. The liquid oil produced was mainly composed of C5-C12 olefins that can be easily converted into paraffin-rich naphtha by hydrogenation or hydrogen transfer reactions as the feedstock for new plastic manufacturing. 8 cycles of regeneration-reaction cycles were carried out successfully with little change on the product distribution, showing the great potential for continuous production of low-aromatic liquid oil. Catalyst characterization showed that the catalyst deactivation was primarily caused by coke deposition (approximately 16.0 wt%) on the surface of the catalysts, and oxidative regeneration was able to recover most of the pore structure and acidity of the zeolite by effectively removing coke.

Abstract: This study examined the effects of seawater aging on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis behavior of nylon-6 (N6) and polyethylene (PE) using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The analyses revealed an increase in the contents of fixed carbon and ash in both N6 and PE due to aging in seawater for five months. FT-IR spectroscopy indicated an increase in the content of the hydroxyl group in the structures of both aged N6 and PE, suggesting their partial decomposition and oxidation during seawater aging. TGA showed that the maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax) and pyrolysis kinetic parameters of N6, such as the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, were changed by seawater aging. Although the Tmax of PE did not change significantly with seawater aging, the differential thermogravimetric peak shape and kinetic parameters of PE were changed by seawater aging.

Abstract: In this paper, thermal degradation of medical plastic waste (the blends of medicinal plastic bottles and plastic infusion bag) that mainly composed of polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) is studied under both inert and oxidative atmospheres using in-situ FTIR, TG-MS and TG-GC/MS coupled analyses. Meanwhile, the gas evolution profiles as well as the function groups of the decomposition residues during medical plastic waste thermal degradation are also discussed. The aliphatic CH, aromatic CC and aromatic CH exhibit the dramatically vary with temperature, indicating the medical plastic waste begins vitrifying at about 100 °C, starts degrading around 300 °C and reaches to the maximum near 400 °C in inert atmosphere, produces mainly styrene, benzene, toluene, and small amounts of C1–C4 aliphatic hydrocarbons as the initial pyrolysis products. The aromatic compounds are mainly ascribed to PS degradation, and alkanes and alkenes are mainly originated from PP creaking. It is also found that the gaseous evolution profiles are well consistent with DTG curves in terms of appearance of peaks and relevant stages in the whole temperature range. Compared with thermal degradation of medical plastic waste in inert atmosphere, the initial degradation temperature for the medical plastic waste is shifted to lower temperature, while the degradation rate is reduced significantly in the oxidative atmosphere that produces oxygenated hydrocarbons such as acetic acid, phenol and benzoic acid due to the O-atom attack.

Abstract: In the last decade the interest in studies of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from different viewpoints has been constantly increasing. In this work, we have prepared multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE), using cobalt(II) acetate as a catalyst precursor, and then their systematic structural characterization has been carried out in parallel with the commercial MWCNTs (Nanocyl NC3100). For that purpose, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermogravimetry were used. The scanning electron microscopic images (SEM) recorded with different magnification of the synthesized product clearly showed the morphology of the carbon nanotubes. In the diffractogram of the as-prepared MWCNTs, in contrast to the commercial MWCNTs, characteristic peaks for metallic Co were observed besides the typical peaks for graphite. When studying the MWCNTs with Raman spectroscopy, an interesting effect of the laser irradiation on the spectral picture was revealed. In the Raman spectrum of the as-prepared MWCNTs recorded with laser power of 0.111mW the appearance of the bands from cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4) modes clearly demonstrated the oxidation of Co particles from the sample to Co3O4. The infrared spectra of the as-prepared and commercial MWCNTs recorded at room temperature (RT) and at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) are shown and compared. There is no noticeable temperature effect on the spectra appearance in both the frequency and intensity of bands. The TGA and DTG curves for investigated MWCNTs in air atmosphere are presented and the overall results are summarized. The results of TGA showed that up to 350°C, the as-prepared MWCNTs are thermally stable in air, and above this temperature the process of thermo-oxidative decomposition proceeds fast and is completed at around 420°C.

Abstract: Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS) are the major plastic fractions found in mixed plastic waste.

In addition, the understanding of feedstock conversion, product yields, and energy requirements in pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis was investigated. Experiments were conducted at a constant microwave power of 450 W till the reaction temperature reached up to 600 °C. When PS pyrolyzed, a heating rate of 56 °C/min resulted in 80 wt% of oil yield. Whereas PP pyrolysis produced 42 wt% of oil at a heating rate of 76 °C/min. In the PP: PS co-pyrolysis, the heating rate was decreased to 52 °C/min by yielding 51 wt% of oil.

Abstract: Polyethylene is a major contributor of plastic waste, which can be converted into liquid fuel via catalytic pyrolysis. In this study, the pyrolysis of light or heavy density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and their mixture with the biochar produced from gasification of poplar wood as catalyst was investigated. The results showed that, during the co-pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE in absence or presence of biochar catalyst, cross-interaction of reaction intermediates originated from the degradation of LDPE and HDPE substantially promoted the formation of gaseous products and the evolution of heavy organics with π-conjugated structures in the tar. During the pyrolysis of HDPE, more heavy tar while less wax was produced, while it was contrary during the pyrolysis of LDPE. In the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE, the volatiles could be effectively cracked over the biochar catalyst, forming more gases, while in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, instead of catalyzing the cracking of the heavy components, the biochar catalyzed the polymerisation reactions.

Abstract: In order to obtain extended storage life of food-grade materials and better barrier properties against environmental factors, a multilayer plastic packaging (MLP) is often used. The multilayer packaging plastics are labelled as “other” (SPI#7) category, and are manufactured with a combination of barrier plastics, rigid plastics and printing surface. Owing to their complex composition and difficulty in separating the layers of MLP, its mechanical recycling is challenging. In this study, MLP wastes (MLPWs) were collected from zero-waste garbage collection center of IIT Madras, India, and thoroughly characterized to determine their composition and plastic types. MLPWs were characterized using various physico-chemical methods such as thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, and proximate and ultimate analyses. The MLPWs were mainly made up of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Further, the non-catalytic and zeolite-catalyzed fast pyrolysis of these MLPWs were studied using analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS). The non-catalytic fast pyrolysis of MLPWs primarily produced a mixture of aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, while zeolite catalyzed fast pyrolysis resulted in the formation of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). The activity of HZSM-5, zeolite Y (HY) and zeolite beta (Hβ) catalysts were evaluated, and the salient products were quantified.

The use of HZSM-5 resulted in highest yield of MAHs, viz. 16.1 wt%, at the optimum temperature of 550 °C and MLPW-to-catalyst ratio of 1:15 (w/w). The superior activity of HZSM-5 is due to its nominal acidity and larger pore size of 4.24 nm, as compared to HY and Hβ.

Abstract: To regulate the migration and transformation of chlorine in the pyrolysis process of medical waste, this study utilized microwave pyrolysis technology for co-pyrolyzing medical gloves (MG) with walnut shells (WS). Furthermore, we innovatively combined microwave thermogravimetry to explore the migration and transformation mechanisms of chlorine under varying temperatures and mix ratios. Under microwave pyrolysis alone, the chlorine in MG mainly existed in the form of HCl and organic chlorine in oil. When WS was added, the chlorine element in HCl migrated to the char, while the organic chlorine in the char was converted to inorganic chlorine. Under optimal microwave co-pyrolysis conditions, the chlorine content in pyrolysis oil decreased to ∼5 %, while chlorine fixation by pyrolysis char reached 65.63 mg/g, a 35.45 mg/g increase compared to MG pyrolysis alone. Through the characterization of pyrolysis char, it was found that the metal oxides in WS could absorb HCl and immobilize it in the form of metal chlorides in the char, thus effectively reducing the generation of HCl.

Abstract: Waste Tyres (WT) are a significant fraction of industrial waste and a source of environmental hazards with limited valorisation. To reduce this problem, currently there is a growing interest in valuing the WT through pyrolysis to obtain multifunctional liquids to improve the rheological and self-healing properties of aged binders. This research provides a comprehensive study on using WT mixtures as precursors for asphalt rejuvenators by means of pyrolysis and distillation processes. To this end, WT polymeric fractions from light (WT-L) and mining trucks (WT-M) were used as feedstock and characterised for compositional and thermal properties. Additionally, micropyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) was used to identify the major products in pyrolysis vapours, to elucidate the reaction maps describing thermal degradation of WTs and to predict the feasible reaction conditions. The pyrolysis liquids were produced after a screening of reaction conditions and subjected to distillation, following a response surface model to produce an optimised pyro-rejuvenator. The results showed that the pyrolytic rejuvenator obtained through pyrolysis at 465 °C and distillation cutting at 160–200 °C is mainly composed of hydrocarbons and aromatic substances (95.5%), with a significant proportion of limonene (33.71%). Furthermore, the pyrolytic rejuvenator exhibited highly desirable physical properties in the context of its application and excellent oxidative stability (85.7%). Otherwise, it was determined that bitumen mixtures with 3%–6% doses of pyro-rejuvenator improved the viscosity, softening point, and penetration of aged binders, restoring their physical properties to the virgin state. In conclusion, pyro-rejuvenators can be successfully used as a promising solution to produce more durable and sustainable pavements with improved rheological and healing properties.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on producing asphalt rejuvenators from waste tyres, with oil composition data reported but not as a fingerprint for plastic feed identification; the primary goal is application performance, not oil-based plastic inference.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Products obtained in the flash pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor, in thermal and catalytic conditions (HZSM-5 or HUSY 20% by weight) at four different temperatures (in the range 500–800°C) have been analyzed in this work focusing on the liquid fraction. The results obtained showed significant differences between condensable compounds generated in presence and absence of catalysts. The liquid fraction obtained without catalyst was composed principally by linear paraffins (C10–C40) and almost no generation of aromatic compounds was observed. The presence of low amounts of zeolite (HZSM-5 or HUSY) led to a significant reduction of the saturated and unsaturated condensable hydrocarbons, while it favored the formation of aromatics and branched paraffins. Compared with the results reached with HZSM-5 zeolite, HUSY produces higher amount of aromatics and branched alkanes and a narrower distribution of products, independently of the pyrolysis temperature.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is currently an effective way to recycle plastics. High-pressure conditions can change the pyrolysis product component distribution, but the microscopic mechanism has not been well elucidated. To explore the relationship of product distribution versus pressure and explain the microscopic mechanism of polyethylene high-pressure pyrolysis, experiments under a large initial pressure range from 1 bar to 51 bar at initial temperatures of 330–380 °C were carried out in an autoclave. In the process of polyethylene high-pressure pyrolysis, the temperature within the reactor exceeded the set temperature by 100 °C at a rate of 150 °C/min. The thermal runaway phenomenon was caused by the polymerization of concentrated olefins in liquid form, which was initiated by hydrocarbon radicals. As the pressure increased, the reaction peak temperature was risen and more small molecules were produced. Under an initial temperature of 340 °C and high-pressure conditions, polyethylene was completely converted into liquid and gas products. The experimental results also revealed that high-pressure conditions led to the production of aromatic compounds and isoparaffins, as well as more cycloalkanes and fewer olefins in the liquid product, making the product characteristics closer to the fuel standard.

Abstract: Microwave power and the susceptor quantity are important operating parameters in the microwave-assisted pyrolysis. This work aims at finding the optimal power and susceptor quantity from a discrete set of microwave powers (300 W, 450 W, and 600 W) and graphite susceptor quantity (50 g, 200 g, and 350 g) to pyrolyze waste polypropylene. The effect of microwave power and the susceptor quantity on heating rate, conversion efficiency, and heat losses in pyrolysis were analyzed using a central composite design (CCD). It was observed that a higher microwave power and lower susceptor quantity yielded higher heating rates, and lower heating rates were obtained for a lower microwave power and higher susceptor quantity. For example, a very low heating rate, averaging to 8.5 °C/min was obtained for a low microwave power (300 W) and a high susceptor quantity (350 g), whereas high values of heating rate (71.7 °C/min) were obtained for a microwave power of 600 W with 50 g of susceptor quantity. For a set of microwave powers considered in this study, it was observed that the required bed temperatures were acquired faster at a low susceptor quantity compared to high susceptor quantity. The oil produced from the pyrolysis of WPP has a high heating value of 44 MJ/kg and the carbon number distribution in the range of C8 to C12. The char produced has rich carbon content (96 wt.%) and a high specific surface area (195 m2/g). Cyclo alkenes with a selectivity of 70% and monocyclic hydrocarbons with a selectivity of 49.6 % were produced at 450 W and 600 W powers respectively for a susceptor quantity of 50 g. From this study, it is found that the microwave power and susceptor quantity are the important parameters for minimizing the microwave energy requirement in the pyrolysis.

Abstract: Globally, as societies urbanize and demand for energy increases, the need to manage mounting quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW), produce renewable energy, and insure clean water supplies becomes more pressing each year. These issues could be addressed by integrating pyrolysis of MSW to recover liquid and gaseous biofuels and a solid biochar, with CO2 activation of the latter to produce activated biochars for water treatment. This potential conversion pathway is experimentally demonstrated by pyrolyzing a model MSW stream at 408 °C, the peak mass loss rate pyrolysis temperature and compared to pyrolysis at 900 °C. As pyrolysis temperature increases, we see conversion of plastic intermediaries into paraffins and polycyclic aromatic compounds, though the desirable gas components (methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide) of the pyrolysis gas increase substantially. The CO2 activated biochars (activated at 600 °C and 900 °C) show surface areas over 300 m2/g, with the lower pyrolysis temperature and higher activation temperature yielding the highest areas.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastics including high density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) has been performed in presence of a series of modified pillared clays (PILC) and Al-PILC. The catalysts were well characterized by BET, FTIR of pyridine adsorption, XRD, SEM, TEM/EDX. The effect of different catalysts on the composition and amount of pyrolysis products including gas, liquid, and char residue was evaluated. With the introduction of Fe-PILC, the yields of oil product were enhanced, suggesting that secondary over-cracking of primary pyrolytic intermediate species was reduced in the presence of the catalyst. A high oil yield of 79.3wt.% with excellent selectivity for diesel fraction (80.5%) and high yield of H2 gas (47.7vol%) were obtained in the case of Fe-PILC. The superior catalytic performance of Fe-PILC is probably attributed to its moderate total acidity, relatively high BET surface area, and uniformly dispersed iron oxide particles on montmorillonite support.

Abstract: While numerous research studies have delved into the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, limited attention has been devoted to comprehending the interaction mechanism that impacts biomass deoxygenation and carbonization. Therefore, this study explores the co-effect of temperature and polypropylene blending ratio on co-pyrolysis reaction kinetics, distribution of oxygenates/hydrocarbons, as well as the evolution of biochar structure. At a blending ratio of 0.5, the co-pyrolysis exhibits the lowest activation energy (146 kJ/mol), approximately 25.1 % lower than that required for individual pyrolysis. The interaction between bamboo waste with polypropylene increases the O-abstraction process, resulting in the creation of O-containing free radicals and hydrocarbon compounds. The peak proportion of aromatic compounds, reaching approximately 69.5 %, is observed at 700 °C when the blending ratio is 0.5. The H-abstraction process converts large-molecular alkanes into H free radicals and tiny-molecular unsaturated hydrocarbons. The aliphatic functional group content diminishes as the polypropylene ratio increases. The maximum specific surface area (7.70 m2/g) and pore volume (21.7 mm3/g) are achieved at a blending ratio of 0.75.

Abstract: Pyrolysis converts plastic waste to fuel range hydrocarbons (HCs) and industrial chemicals but requires high purity polyolefin waste. However, practical plastic waste is a heterogeneous mixture, enabling a limited amount of high purity plastic recycling. Pyrolysis of mixed plastic produces low quality plastic oil, necessitating a series of refining processes to obtain low yield of target chemicals. In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis can directly convert mixed plastic into higher value syngas, but rapid catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition is a problem. In this study, a sustainable platform for mixed plastic to syngas was developed by introducing Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst and CO2 as a feedstock gas. Volatile HCs evolved from pyrolysis of plastic were decomposed over Ni catalyst to produce shorter chained HCs and H2, but catalyst deactivation was shown by carbon deposition under N2. When CO2 was introduced, HCs were further converted into syngas (H2 and CO) by catalytic reactions with CO2, suppressing carbon deposition on catalyst. The best yield of gaseous products from catalytic pyrolysis of a polypropylene was 377 % at 650 °C under CO2, which was more than 7 times higher gas yield under N2. When heterogeneous plastic mixture was used as a reactant, the same trend was shown, and the presence of aromatic plastics in plastic mixture increased the yield of aromatic compounds.

Abstract: It becomes common to wear a disposable face mask to protect from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) amid this pandemic.

The disposable mask is made of different compounds, making it hard to be recycled. In this regard, this work suggests an environmentally benign disposal process, simultaneously achieving the production of valuable fuels from the face mask.

The first part of this work determined the major chemical constituents of a disposable mask: polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, and Fe. In the second part, pyrolysis study was employed to produce syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) from the disposable mask. To enhance syngas and C1-2 HCs formations, multi-stage pyrolysis was used for more C–C and C–H bonds scissions of the disposable mask.

Based on the Gas chromatography analysis and the distillation curves, no synergetic effect was observed for different mixture compositions. As pyrolysis products of PP and PE cover a wide range of hydrocarbons, a separation into different fractions was suggested before using them as fuels. The separation temperatures were optimized and it was found that 160 °C is the temperature at which the boiling point distribution and physical properties of light fraction of both PP and PE products can be compatible with gasoline fuel norms, and 220 °C is the temperature at which heavy fractions are compatible with diesel fuel norms.

Abstract: With the urbanization and population growth, the disposal of plastic waste has become a significant challenge, as the traditional methods often result in pollution and resource wastage. Pyrolysis technology offers a sustainable solution by converting the waste plastics into valuable gas or liquid fuels. The co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass is an effective approach for synergistically managing these two types of solid waste. The polyethylene (PE) and salix psammophila (SP) was used to investigate the gas production characteristics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation during the co-pyrolysis. Additionally, Cu/ZSM-5, Co/ZSM-5, and Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts were employed to investigate the effects of different metal-loaded catalysts on the co-pyrolysis process. The results indicate that, with the increase of the pyrolysis temperature, the yield of gas-phase products gradually increases, solid residue decreases, and liquid-phase products initially increase before declining, reaching their maximum at 500 °C. The synergistic effect promotes the formation of C2Hm (C2H2, C2H4, C2H6) and CH4, leading to the increase of the gas-phase product yields compared to the individual pyrolysis. The addition of catalysts further enhances the gas production: Cu/ZSM-5 boosts H2 yield, Co/ZSM-5 shows selectivity for CH4 and C2Hm, and Ni/ZSM-5 exhibits better selectivity for CO and H2. Under the various pyrolysis conditions, aromatic compounds and aliphatic hydrocarbons consistently dominate the liquid-phase products.

The addition of catalysts reduces the proportions of both aliphatic and aromatic compounds. PAHs generation is temperature-dependent, significantly increasing at 700 °C.

Abstract: The gasification technology has shown great potential to upcycle plastic waste for clean and high-value fuel. Gasification of disposable plastic masks was investigated in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalytic reforming system, aiming at producing the syngas with flexible H2 to CO ratio which can be tuned for various downstream applications without further purification and adjustment. To maximize the syngas yield and minimize the carbon deposition, different gasifying agents in the staged catalytic process was explored. The results showed that CO2 significantly promoted syngas production mainly by increasing CO yield. However, H2-rich syngas was obtained via using steam as the gasifying agent. Competitive and synergistic relationships between CO2 and H2O agent at co-feeding process were further revealed. CO2 facilitated the reforming of H2O at low dose of steam while exhibiting a main competition with adequate steam except for synergy at 5 mL/min CO2 flow rate. An optimum H2-rich syngas yield of 135.59 mmol/gplastic with H2/CO ratio of 2 was obtained at co-feeding reactants. Therefore, the co-feeding of H2O and CO2 could show positive effect for both coke removal and syngas quality regulation.

Abstract: Soot is an important toxic pollutant generated during high-temperature incineration of solid waste (i.e., biomass and plastic waste) under air-lean conditions, and has a great impact on flame radiation. The main objective of this work is to study the synergistic effect of biomass and polyurethane co-pyrolysis on soot formation at high temperatures (1100–1250 °C). The effects of temperature, biomass species, and co-pyrolysis ratio on the yield, morphology, composition and reactivity of soot particles are studied. Results show that under controlled co-pyrolysis conditions, the measured soot yield from co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyurethane is lower than the theoretical value by weight average, while the particle size distribution tends to concentrate on a smaller diameter range. The degree of synergistic effect increases with the increasing biomass ratio (0–50 wt%) and decreasing pyrolysis temperature. Wood in co-pyrolysis presents a stronger synergistic effect on soot yields than straw co-pyrolysis does. Degree of synergistic effect on soot oxidation reactivity depends much on the biomass addition ratio but less on pyrolysis temperature. At 10 wt% straw addition ratio, co-pyrolysis exerts a negative synergistic effect on soot oxidation reactivity, while the synergistic effect turns significantly positive when the straw addition ratio increases to 50 wt%.",NO,NO,"The study focuses on soot formation during co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyurethane, with no mention of liquid/oil product composition or yield.",NO_LAB_EXPERIMENT;NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Recycled PMMA was prepared by directly polymerizing crude pyrolysis oils from lab-scale pyrolysis of collected industrial waste PMMA. The pyrolysis oils consisted mainly of methyl methacrylate (MMA, >85%), while the type and number of by-products from the thermal process were assigned through GC–MS analysis showing a clear correlation to the pyrolysis temperature. By-products can be removed by distillation; however, directly employing the crude oils to prepare PMMA through solution, suspension, emulsion, or casting polymerization was investigated to assess the potential for omitting this costly step. It was found that the crude pyrolysis oils could be polymerized efficiently via solution, emulsion, and casting polymerization to produce a polymer similar to the PMMA prepared from a pristine monomer. The impurities in the PMMAs prepared from the crude mixtures were investigated by extraction analyses followed by screening by GC–MS. In the case of casting polymerization, the GC–MS analysis, as expected, revealed various residual by-products, while solution and emulsion polymerization showed only very few impurities, mainly originating from the polymerization and not the feed material. Additional purification of the crude pyrolysis oils would be required for applications in casting polymerization.

Abstract: Since 2000, global plastic waste production and consumption have doubled, escalating from 250 to 500 million tonnes. Merely 9 % of plastic waste undergoes global recycling, leaving the majority either in landfills or poorly managed. This research introduces a new catalyst, GMOF, created by growing Metal-Organic Framework (MOFs) rods on the flaked, carpet-like structure of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanosheets. The aim is to enhance the quality of pyrolysis products derived from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste using this GMOF catalyst. HDPE and LDPE, sourced from post-consumer plastic packaging, underwent specific treatment involving cleaning, drying, and shredding. Morphological and property evaluations of GO nanosheets before and after MOF decoration employed techniques including Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Flash pyrolysis at 500 °C for 1 min using a sample-to-catalyst ratio of 4:1 in a Quartz Wool Matrix (QWM) reactor was conducted via a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Frontier LAB pyrolizers. Thermal stability and characteristics of feedstocks and catalysts were assessed using TGA.

Abstract: This study investigates the pyrolysis of polyethylene waste in a continuous-feed mode to provide novel insights into recycling waste plastics.

The pyrolysis product yields, oil fractions, and gas components have been determined under varying porous media structures, i.e., thickness and pore size, and operating parameters, i.e., temperature and gas-carrying velocity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to investigate the influence of porous media pore size on the thermal decomposition of waste polyolefin in continuous feeding mode. The results reveal that higher thicknesses and smaller pore sizes of porous media can enhance the properties of pyrolysis oil with lower heavy fractions (>C20).

Abstract: Waste plastic mitigation is one of the major concerns for achieving a sustainable environment. The present study reported the conversion of mixed waste plastics into hydrocarbon fuels through catalytic pyrolysis using DOL, SiDOL, ZSM-5, and ZSMDOL catalysts. Doping of Si and ZSM-5 enhanced the surface area as well as improved catalytic activity. The NMR analysis confirmed that pyro-oil contains 8.31–12.61, 17.53–29.12, and 62.38–69.86 (v/v)% of aromatics, olefins, and paraffin's hydrocarbons, respectively.

Abstract: Thermal catalytic and non catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were carried out in a batch reactor at 450°C. The major product obtained from the non-catalytic pyrolysis of PE was 80wt% of wax, while the degradation of PP without any catalyst produced 85.5% of liquid. In catalytic degradation, ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite was used in a ratio of 1:10, with respect to PE and PP. In both cases, polymers were converted to liquid products with high yields (71 and 82wt% respectively) and a low amount of coke deposit has appeared. The liquid fraction derived from the catalytic pyrolysis of PE was a mixture of C5-C39 compounds and that of PP was a mixture of C5-C30.

Abstract: Different wastes are generated by the steel industry, among them the shredder residue (SR).

In this context, the addition of CaO in the pyrolysis process can decrease the release of acid gases, especially HCl. The objective of this work was to evaluate the role of CaO and its influence on Chlorine during the thermochemical conversion of SR. A fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor was used and the following variables were evaluated using a 2k factorial design: temperature, heating rate, inert gas flow (N2) and CaO/SR ratio. The chlorine retention in char was higher in the experiments conducted in the presence of CaO. A decrease of the metals retention in char was verified in the experiments conducted with CaO for the following metals: Co, Cu, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn. Through the removal of chlorine, it would be possible to conduct the pyrolysis process at higher temperatures, increasing its energy efficiency (EE). Therefore, the necessity to remove chlorine from SR before the pyrolysis process is evidenced, since from this the use of CaO would contribute to the EE increase and the metals retention in char, and consequently with the global desirability increase.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on chlorine removal and metal retention during pyrolysis of shredder residue with CaO, with no mention of oil composition or liquid product characterization.",NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: To unveil the nitrogen migration and conversion characteristics, catalytic copyrolysis of biomass pseudo components and polyamide (PA) with different blend ratios (1:0, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 0:1) under an ammonia atmosphere was proposed to boost the yield of N-containing compounds (NCCs) and N-rich biochar. The evolution and distribution of NCCs in liquid, gas and biochar were systematically investigated with a combination of TG-MS, Py-GC/MS and EPR. Synergistic effects and possible reaction pathways were also evaluated. Experimental results showed that PA could obviously boost biomass conversion due to increasing the chance of secondary cleavage, and the comprehensive synergistic effect of biomass-derived H* radicals, acid sites of the catalyst and cracking reactions (-C-N and C-C bonds) that reduced the reaction energy barrier and enhanced the NH3 and HCN yields. NH3 comes from the amino acids that are released from the amino acid pyrolysis and hydrolysis of HCN on the surface of char, while HCN is from the secondary cracking of primary pyrolysis products. Adding biomass increased CO2, CO, CH4, C-O and CO emissions from co-pyrolysis. Additionally, significant synergetic effects were observed when Biomass/PA= 3:1, which improved the NCCs and pyridine yields by 78.58% and 48.23%, respectively, under the HZSM-5 catalyst. A lower proportion of PA addition facilitated the Maillard reaction and amide bond cleavage to enhance the NCCs content and suppressed π-conjugated ring structure compound evolution and coke-derived O-containing compound polymerization, while a higher content of PA was favorable for amine and diaza heterocycle compound formation.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of coke bottle (CB) with sawdust/cellulose/lignin was conducted at 700 °C in this study, aiming to understand the potential influence of interactions of the volatiles of the varied origins on properties of the char. The results indicated that the interaction of volatiles from CB with that from biomass enhanced cross-polymerization of the volatiles, decreasing the formation of gases while enhanced the formation of both char and oil. The cross-interactions of the intermediates also diminished the formation of π-conjugated organics. In addition, the varied volatiles from the pyrolysis of cellulose, lignin, or sawdust interacted with that from CB and affected the properties of char in different ways. The char from the co-pyrolysis of sawdust/CB was more aliphatic, and had a higher oxygen content (7.3%) and higher polarity but lower thermal stability.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new-type three-stage thermochemical conversion process with an auger reactor (AR), fluidized bed gasifier (FBG), and tar-cracking reactor (TCR) to recover HCl and a clean and H2-rich syngas from waste PVC. In the AR heated to approximately 300 and 400 °C, pyrolysis produces HCl through dehydrochlorination. On the other hand, the FBG and TCR produce syngas from the pyrolysis residue.

When the AR was heated to 300 and 400 °C, approximately 70 wt% of the product was generated in the gasification part, and liquids collected in the AR part contained most of the chlorine present in waste PVC. The chlorine content in syngas and total tar yield decreased significantly when the AR was heated. The optimal FBG temperature appeared to be approximately 700 °C.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis with low rank coal is an important way to treat waste plastics and recycle them into valuable materials. Complex interactions between volatiles-feedstock, volatiles-volatiles, and volatiles-char co-exist during co-pyrolysis, which will influence the synergistic effects and have not been extensively understood. In this work, some new feedstock configurations were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor to explore the contribution of these complicated interactions between different sources to the synergy effect observed during co-pyrolysis of Hami coal (HM) and polystyrene (PS). Results show that the interaction between PS-volatiles and HM-volatiles is found to be a dominant contributor to tar lightening in co-pyrolysis, which accounts for 5.67 wt% increase in the content of gasoline fractions (<180 °C) compared to the theoretical calculated value. Meanwhile, the content of gasoline fractions in tar increases with the enhancement of the interaction between volatiles and unreacted-HM. The volatiles and unreacted-HM interaction is the main contributions to synergy in aromatization of char, while the PS-volatiles and HM-char interaction plays an opposite role. The co-pyrolysis of HM-char locating on the top of PS also reveals the catalytic activity of HM-char on PS decomposition. Furthermore, the interaction between unreacted-HM and PS-melt is not conducive to the production of gas, but favorable to the production of char with high aromaticity. These results provide a valuable supplement for the understanding of the interaction mechanisms during co-pyrolysis, and also help to enhance synergistic pathways of the target products while simultaneously reducing inhibitory interactions.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with coal, no pure plastic-only condition with oil composition data.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Producing value-added light aromatics (BTEX) from solid waste streams holds excellent promise for resource recovery. Here we present a thermochemical conversion approach that enhanced BTEX production by coupling CO2 atmosphere and Fe-modified HZSM-5 zeolite to facilitate the Diels-Alder reactions in catalytic pyrolysis of sawdust and polypropylene. The Diels-Alder reactions between sawdust-derived furans and polypropylene-derived olefins could be controlled by tuning CO2 concentration and Fe loading amount. Sufficient CO2 (≥50%) with moderate Fe loading (10 wt%) were observed to produce more BTEX and fewer heavy fractions (C9 +aromatics). To deepen the mechanistic understanding, quantification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and catalyst coke was further conducted. The co-use of CO2 atmosphere and Fe modification suppressed the appearance of low-, medium-, and high-membered ring PAHs by over 40%, decreased pyrolysis oil toxicity from 42.1 to 12.8 μg/goil TEQ, and transformed coke from ""hard"" to ""soft"". Based on the characterization of CO2 adsorption behavior, it was deduced that the introduced CO2 was activated by loaded Fe and reacted in situ with H2 generated during aromatization to expedite H-transfer. Meanwhile, BTEX recondensation was prevented through the Boudouard reactions of CO2 and water-gas reactions between the resulting water and carbon deposits.

Abstract: This research explores the synergistic effects and distribution of liquid products during microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis (MACP) of eucalyptus wood (EW) and polypropylene (PP). Firstly, thermal degradation and kinetics, of co-pyrolysis of EW and PP were investigated. The minimum average activation energy was observed at a mixing ratio of 50 % EW to 50 % PP, measuring 187.98 kJ/mol (KAS) and 189.82 kJ/mol (OFW), respectively. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, material ratio and microwave absorbent amount on the MACP of EW and PP were investigated based on the Orthogonal Design of Experiments (OED) method. The yield of three-phase product and chemical composition of liquid product were analyzed. The results indicated that the MACP of EW and PP significantly enhanced both the yield and quality of bio-oil. Optimal oil yield was achieved through MACP of EW and PP at 550℃ with a ratio of 30 % EW, 70 % PP, and 120 wt% microwave absorbent (SiC).

Abstract: Thermal decomposition of commingled plastics comprising high and low density polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and poly(vinyl chloride) was investigated under vacuum conditions by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range of 25–600°C. The mixtures were representative of the major polymeric materials found in a municipal plastic waste (MPW) stream. The study focused on the role of each polymer in the stabilization or destabilization of other interacting plastics, as well as the fate of chlorine produced from PVC. First, the decomposition of each single plastic was investigated. Then the binary combination of all above polymers and finally the multicomponent mixture similar to a MPW sample were studied. Two approaches have been applied to study the interaction between components in the commingled plastics. The first approach involved a comparison of the experimental curve of the decomposition of the mixture with a calculated non-interacting component decomposition curve based on the behavior of the individual polymers. The second approach involved a comparison of the kinetic parameters of each plastic in the mixture as determined by two different methods: (1) fitting the single polymer decomposition curve and (2) fitting the peak corresponding to the pyrolysis of one particular polymer on the mixture pyrolysis curve. The results obtained indicate that some interactions occurred during MPW pyrolysis, mainly at high temperatures (>375°C).

Abstract: The nature and reactivity of the oxygenates, containing different functional chemical groups, and especially carbonyl compounds, render pyrolysis oil unstable. Alterations in physical and chemical properties of pyrolysis oil during storage and the catalytic stabilization of this oil is therefore critical and is the objective of the current work. In this study, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Rh/Al2O3, Re/Al2O3 and sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were employed in the hydrotreatment (180 °C, 60 bar H2, 4 h) of simulated pyrolysis oil to examine their effect on stabilization and potential polymerization routes. Of all the catalysts used, Pd/Al2O3 with well-dispersed metal particles, and a high char-suppressing potential was the most effective catalyst. It had the highest bio-liquid yield and the highest selectivity to low molecular weight stabilized oxygenates and deoxygenated products. In addition, the acidity in the light fraction was low and a very low solid product formation was found that consisted mainly of soluble polymers composed predominantly of aliphatic compounds and sugars, whereas insoluble polymers were not fully developed char. The solid yield increased in the following order: Pd (3.3 wt%) < Rh (13.3 wt%) < NiMo (13.6 wt%) < Pt (21.5 wt%) < Re (25.8 wt%) < Blank (27.4 wt%). This trend was also accompanied by an enhanced yield of heavy oligomers in the corresponding liquid phase abundant in phenolic compounds compared to carboxylic acids and aliphatic compounds based on GPC and P-NMR analyses. The Pd loading necessary to obtain a high-quality product was also assessed, and the lower carbon loss when using catalysts with smaller contents of metal was revealed. Based on the results a detailed reaction network was proposed regarding the reactions during stabilization of sugars, aldehydes, ketones, furans, acids and phenols present in pyrolysis oil. To delve deeper into the simulated pyrolysis oil properties, it was subjected to accelerated aging. Interestingly as much as 79 % of the feed was converted during aging. According to GC/MS analysis only large oligomers were formed that could not be detected. When removing the most reactive components from the feed, i.e. the sugar and furan, the conversion was lowered to 53 %. Catalytic stabilization was conducted on the aged oil and compared with stabilization followed by aging. The results showed that the solid formation increased from 5.1 to 9.1 % when the pyrolysis oil was first aged, followed by stabilization. A suggested reason for this is the large amount of oligomers that were formed during the aging.

Effects of PET: RH ratio and total mass of co-pyrolysis feed mixture were thoroughly investigated. Mass and energy yields of bio-crude, char, and gas were evaluated. Microwave energy consumption and energy efficiency of pyrolysis were also evaluated. Pyrolysis energy efficiency is higher at 40 g (73–76%) compared to 20 g (53–75%) of co-pyrolysis feed mixture.

We utilized an HZSM-5 catalyst within a unique setup that incorporates a catalyst bed constructed from a quartz fibre membrane filter. This innovative hybrid method, a combination of in-situ and ex-situ modes, was designed to shield the catalyst from direct contact with undesired materials, thereby facilitating easy catalyst separation at the end of the process. Experiments were conducted in a high-pressure batch reactor, heated to 400 °C within a closed thermodynamic system. Parallel runs were performed for both pure and waste LDPE, with and without the catalyst.

Abstract: Food packaging waste-stream is a serious threat for current lifestyle sustainability.

Its composition represents a challenge for waste management due the simultaneous presence of poly(ethylene), paper and aluminum, wrapped together into a multilayered packaging. In this work, we report on the pyrolytic conversion of Tetra Pak® to produce alumina-rich biochar (BC), to be used as a flame retardant for an ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA) copolymer. In particular, the obtained biochar was incorporated either into bulk EVA through compounding or just as a surface coating. For the surface approach, a masterbatch of biochar and EVA was prepared and then applied to the surface of unfilled EVA specimens. Both the strategies turned out to significantly improve the overall flame retardant features of the copolymer: as compared to unfilled EVA, the bulk approach promoted a remarkable decrease of peak of heat release rate (-45 and -65%, for the compounds containing 20 and 40 wt.% of BC, respectively) and of total heat release (-16.9% for the compounds filled with 40 wt.% of BC), combined with a significant increase of the residues at the end of forced combustion tests; conversely, the surface approach was capable of delaying the time to ignition and the time to peak of heat release rate, depending of the BC amount: more specifically, for the surface-coated EVA with the lowest BC loading (i.e. 3 wt.%), the two parameters increased by about 34 and 21%, respectively. The thermal, rheological and mechanical properties were also investigated, as well as the morphology of the BC particles and their dispersion in the copolymer matrix.

Abstract: With the increasing global energy demand and the worsening issue of energy shortages, the energy crisis has become a significant challenge worldwide. Meanwhile, the disposal of medical and agricultural waste is also becoming an increasingly critical issue. Medical waste, such as protective clothing, contains hazardous substances that, if improperly managed, pose threats to the environment and public health. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, not only consume high amounts of energy but also make it difficult to recover energy and materials from the waste. To address these problems, this study proposes a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution, aiming to convert hazardous medical waste into valuable fuel products such as CH4, H2, and CO through pyrolysis technology. In this regard, the study conducted a series of simulation experiments to analyze the pyrolysis of medical protective clothing (MPC), cow dung (CD), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and corn straw (CS) under different temperature and mixing conditions. The results show that the pyrolysis of MPC alone predominantly produces char (accounting for around 50%). Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC enhances the product yield. For example, at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC increases the methane (CH4) yield by 12% compared to the pyrolysis of MPC alone. Additionally, a life cycle assessment and a techno-economic evaluation were conducted from an application perspective. The results indicate that the project is economically feasible with net profits achievable in the second year of operation and has no harmful environmental impacts.

Abstract: As an important component of organic solid wastes, disposal of plastic wastes (PWs) has always been a thorny issue. Thermochemical conversion is an efficient method. In-depth research on the influence of structural differences on their pyrolysis behavior is beneficial to promote the development of thermal treatment and conversion technology of PWs. The differences in the chemical structure of different polyolefin plastics at the molecule level are mainly reflected in their side chains. Herein, a series of typical polyolefin plastics with similar backbone structure and different side chain structures, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), were selected for comprehensive pyrolysis characterization in this work. Advanced experimental analysis methods such as in-situ DRIFT and 2D-PCIS were adopted to investigate the evolution of two weak oxygen-containing side chains during pyrolysis of PVA and EVA, respectively. Besides, typical product distribution of six samples were systematically studied by combining SVUV-PIMS and GC/MS. Spectral analysis showed that OH side chain in macromolecular structure of PVA had the weakest thermal stability, and its oxidation reaction occurred earlier than dissociation and dehydration, while the acetoxy side chain in EVA polymers could not only be directly dissociated via deacetoxylation, but also be transformed into OH side chain via deacetylation that occurred simultaneously with deacetoxylation. Further combined with SVUV-PIMS and GC/MS, the distribution characteristics of pyrolysis products of polyolefin plastics and the rules of generation and release of typical products with temperature were obtained in detail. It was found that the release of typical oxygen-containing products was earlier or slightly earlier than the release of hydrocarbons in pyrolysis of PVA or EVA. However, the release of all hydrocarbons was almost simultaneous during the respective pyrolysis process of HDPE, PP and PS, suggesting that the evolution of oxygen-containing side chains with weak thermal stability occurred earlier under the drive of temperature. Based on the characterization results, the main evolution pathways of different side chains were proposed to explain the influence mechanism of different side chain structures on the pyrolysis behavior of polyolefin plastics.

Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) constitutes an important component of solid waste, and recovering valuable chemicals and resources from it holds a high priority in solid waste management. The various chemical functionalities present in the organic fraction of e-waste can be converted to valuable chemicals and fuel molecules by pyrolysis process. In this study, non-isothermal pyrolysis of waste printed circuit board (PCB), waste keyboard keys (KB), and their equal composition mixture is conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates. The kinetic analysis was carried out using isoconversional method of Vyazovkin and the multi-Gaussian distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The average apparent activation energies of pyrolysis of PCB, PCB: KB, and KB, determined using the Vyazovkin method, were 188.4, 167.6, and 169 kJ mol−1, respectively. The apparent activation energy determined using the DAEM varied in a wide range owing to the decomposition of multiple pseudo-components. Analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) was used to identify the pyrolysates from PCB, KB, and their mixtures at 500 °C. The major pyrolysate functional groups from PCB were phenolic derivatives (36%), oxygenates (26%), and phenyl phosphates (14.4%), while KB pyrolysis yielded aromatics (52%) containing styrene as the major compound. Pyrolysis of mixtures resulted in a net increase in the selectivity to aromatics with a concomitant decrease in oxygenates suggesting dehydration and decarboxylation to be the major reactions.

Abstract: The problem of marine plastic pollution, mainly composed of polyolefin plastics, is becoming increasingly serious, and reducing marine plastic pollution is urgent. Pyrolysis, as a promising technology for treating polyolefin plastics such as polystyrene (PS), has great potential in addressing marine plastic pollution issues. In order to explore the possibility of resource utilization of marine plastics, this article studied the effect of pressure changes on the pyrolysis products of marine plastics. Marine PS was prepared by soaking routine PS in artificial seawater and air drying, and the most significant difference between the two was found to be the salt attached to the surface. The dynamic characteristics of marine PS were analyzed using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods, and the apparent activation energy of marine PS calculated by FWO and KAS methods are 102.94 kJ·mol−1 and 95.76 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The effect of pressure at different temperatures on the pyrolysis products of marine PS was studied. The results indicate that the yield of pyrolysis oil decreases as the pressure is increased, while solid products are obtained from scratch. The increase in pressure will gradually make the composition of the thermolytic gas become monotonous. Under critical pressure, pressurization promotes an increase in CH4 content while reducing H2 content, causing the lower heating value of pyrolysis gas to increase to 4.355 kJ·g−1. Analysis of oil content found that increasing pressure promotes the growth of Benzene Toluene Ethylbenzene & Xylene (BTEX) to 33.61%, but excessive pressure can significantly reduce the higher heating value from 42.116 MJ·kg−1 to 31.825 MJ·kg−1.

Abstract: The catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with aluminosilicate catalysts is a promising method for the direct production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels consisting mainly of aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes). On the other hand, the economic and commercial viability of this process is limited by the low yields of aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, the effects of biomass torrefaction, co-feeding of plastic wastes, their combination, and the catalytic upgrading mode (in-situ vs ex-situ) on the aromatic formation efficiency during the catalytic pyrolysis of yellow poplar were evaluated systematically to maximize the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Two representative catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis (i.e., microporous HZSM-5 and mesoporous Al-MCM-41) were used in this case study. The torrefaction of yellow poplar led to the enhanced production of aromatic hydrocarbons in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene over both catalysts. The experimental yields of aromatic hydrocarbons from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene were also higher than their theoretical yields, highlighting the synergistic aromatic formation by the interaction of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene. Between the two catalysts, microporous HZSM-5 exhibited much higher activity for aromatic production from catalytic co-pyrolysis owing to its strong acidity and appropriate pore structure.

Abstract: Waste plastics pyrolysis oil (WPPO) is currently reprocessed to fuel components and ultimately combusted.

However, little is known about their cracking behavior.

We found that some WPPOs provided deeply reduced yields of the desired products, while others provided yields comparable or superior to typical naphtha (the highest yields were 32 % ethylene and 16 % propylene). Therefore, some WPPOs could replace a part of crude oil-based feedstock.

Abstract: Recycling of waste polymers has become a necessity because huge piles of those polymers represent a threat to the environment. Used polymers are also a source of energy and valuable chemicals. Used low density polyethylenes (LDPE) were catalytically pyrolysed in a home assembled batch reactor under atmospheric pressure. For maximum conversion into chemicals which could be used for feedstock recovery optimum conditions like temperature, catalyst weight and reaction time were optimized. A wide range of acidic and basic catalysts like silica, calcium carbide, alumina, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide and homogeneous mixture of silica and alumina were tried for this purpose. Though CaC2 was better on the basis of reaction time, however the efficiency of conversion into liquid for SiO2 was found to be maximum at optimum conditions. These two catalysts could be picked up as suitable catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene. The results of the column separation using different solvents indicate that the oxide containing catalyst could be best suited for selective conversion into polar and aromatic products while CaC2 catalyst could be adopted for selective conversion into aliphatic products.

From the physical tests it was observed that the results for the liquid fractions are comparable with the standard results of physical tests for gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel oil. From the Bromine water and KMnO4 tests it was observed that liquid obtained is a mixture of olefin and aromatic hydrocarbons. This was further confirmed by Bromine number tests.

Abstract: High impact polystyrene (PS) type plastics constitute an important part of electronic waste. Due to limited recycling, they are disposed of by incineration or landfilling, which leads to environmental problems. Therefore, increasing recycling is of great importance. This study explored the effect of the char (C) and liquid (L) components obtained by recycling PS waste plastic via pyrolysis method on the performance properties of warm mix asphalt (WMA). In the study, modified bitumen were prepared by blending base bitumen (50–70 penetration grade) with pyrolysis char and/or liquid at 0–3–6–10 % ratios (by weight of bitumen). The effects of pyrolysis products on WMA were investigated by binder tests including penetration, softening point, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Rotational Viscometer, Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) as well as mixture tests like Marshall Design, Hamburg Wheel Tracking (HWT), and Thermal Stress Restraint Specimen Test (TSRST). The binder test findings indicated a significant alteration in the characteristics of bitumen while utilizing 6 % of the char and liquid component additions. The incorporation of PS 6 %C-6 %L resulted in an increase in bitumen penetration, accompanied by a drop in softening point and viscosity. The reduction in viscosity culminated in a 15ºC decrease in the mixing-compaction temperature of the mixture. From the DSR and BBR analyses, the addition of PS 6 %C-6 %L decreased the performance grade (PG) high temperature of base bitumen by 1 grade, while the PG low improved by 1 grade. Marshall and HWT tests demonstrated that the stability and rutting resistance of WMA (PS 6 %C-6 %L) was equal to 89 % of that of hot mix asphalt (HMA). TSRST results also indicated that the low-temperature performance of WMA was 29 % and 8 % higher than HMA in terms of fracture temperature and thermal stress, respectively.

Abstract: Microwave pyrolysis is a very effective technique to convert organic waste into energy rich products. In the present work micro porous and carbonaceous OPS char was synthesized by microwave pyrolysis technique. OPS char yield and its BET surface area was investigated as a function of process parameters to make the microwave pyrolysis of OPS more efficient. Both of these quantities were found to be affected by the process parameters. With the rise in microwave power (MWP) and radiation time (RT), OPS char yield was lowered while increase N2 flow rate (NFR) increased the OPS char yield slightly. Extreme values of either of the process parameter was seen to lower the BET surface area of OPS char. Response Surface Methodology (RSM), was used to optimize the process parameters for maximized OPS char yield and its BET surface area. Regression models for the OPS char yield and its BET surface area were also developed in this study. These regression models were having high Fischer test value & lower p-value which ensure its reliability and applicability. ANOVA analysis of the experimental data provided the process parameters to achieve maximized OPS char yield (60.93%) and BET surface area (250.03 m2/g).

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics under nitrogen-rich conditions to produce nitrogenous compounds represents a highly promising technological approach.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is an effective way for clean and efficient use of coal, as well as an important way for efficient conversion of waste plastics. A two-step treatment scheme was proposed for chlorine-containing plastics that are difficult to be treated harmlessly. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Pingshuo (PS) coal were used in this study. The PVC was preheated to remove most of the chlorine, and then the pretreated PVC residue (DPVC) and coal were co-pyrolyzed. GC, simulated distillation, GC-MS, elemental analysis, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze and characterize composition and properties of pyrolysis gas, tar and char. The results show that co-pyrolysis process of DPVC and PS coal has a synergistic effect, and has an obvious positive synergistic effect on formation of char and tar. The experimental value of tar yield is higher than theoretical calculation and the maximum increasing value is 3.35%. There is a negative synergistic effect on formation of pyrolysis water and gas, in which CH4 has the largest decrease in yield, meaning the strongest negative synergy. Co-pyrolysis increases content of light tar, significantly increases content of naphthalenes, and reduces that of asphalt. When DPVC addition is 10%, content of light tar increases by 5 percentage points over the theoretical calculation value.

Abstract: Ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass to aromatics has been extensively investigated, simultaneously, aromatization have been reported to be promoted under pressure, but available research did not discuss the combined effect of catalytic co-pyrolysis and pressure on aromatics production. In this work, ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyethylene and lignin over HZSM-5 under a series of pressure (0.1–0.8 MPa) in a Py-GC/MS system was investigated. We show that pressurized operation during co-pyrolysis of polyethylene and lignin leads to a large increase in BTEX relative yield while maintaining catalyst stability. A very high BTEX relative yield of 70.94% can be achieved at temperature of 650 °C, pressure of 0.5 MPa, polyethylene to lignin ratio of 1:1, and catalyst to raw material ratio of 4:1. Ratio of two raw materials significantly affects efficiency of hydrogen radicals-mass transfer by regulation of hydrogen radical emission and reception. A peak value of BTEX relative yield of 70.27% was obtained at a polyethylene to lignin ratio of 4:3. Among BTEX, benzene and toluene are more prone to alkylate and polycondensate into highly branched and polycyclic aromatics, due to a lower steric hindrance. Hydrogen radicals-mass transfer has a significant effect on BTEX production, and mass transfer efficiency can be regulated by appropriate pressure and raw materials ratios. Meanwhile, pressurized operation has a dual positive effect on coke inhibition via promoting hydrogen radicals-mass transfer and water release, such that catalyst stability and BTEX production are promoted.

Abstract: Paraffin wax and syngas are the major energy products synthesized by pyrolysis of metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW). These pyrolysis products contain a small amount of flammable compounds with negligible economic profit. Within this framework, this work aims to upgrade wax into oil and to increase the yield of flammable gases (e.g., CH4, C2H6, C3H8) in syngas generated during pyrolysis of MFPW using the catalytic pyrolysis process over ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (10, 30, and 50 wt.%). The thermo-chemical experiments were performed in a semi-batch pyrolysis plant at 600°C. N2, O2, CO2, CO, CH4, and H2 gases generated during the entire process were observed with a digital gas analyser, while FTIR and GC measurements were employed to specify the chemical compounds of the obtained energy products (oil or wax and gases). Finally, aluminium (Al) fraction was separated from the obtained solid product of pyrolysis using leaching process. The results showed that addition of 10 and 30 wt.% of ZSM-5 to the reaction contributed to increase in wax yield from 12% to 19% without a significant effect on its structure.

Experiments were performed using a conventional retort tube as a batch reactor. The operating factors considered were temperature and reaction time at constant heating rate. High density polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS), the most common plastic waste in Korea, were used singly and in mixture. The pyrolysis time for maximum oil production from a PE-PS mixture was shorter than in the case of PE alone, showing an enhancement effect from the PS. The maximum gas production time from PE-PS mixtures was shorter than for PE alone at 500° C; above 600° C, this does not occur.

Biochar from intermediate pyrolysis was directly employed as a catalyst, but steam-activated biochars with different activation times from single step activation were also studied as low-cost catalysts.

Abstract: In the present work, a preliminary study of the pyrolysis process of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fluidized bed is investigated in order to determine the influence between the fluidynamic properties of the bed reactor and the amount and composition of the gases produced. As is known, fluidized bed technology is a very interesting option to apply in the pyrolysis field due to i) the lack of moving parts in the hot region that facilitates the maintenance of equipment, ii) the high surface area to volume ratio available in the bed, and iii) the high heat transfer coefficient reached which governs the reaction products.

Abstract: Plastics contribute significantly to the plight of an ideal solid waste management system, and the dilemma of its safe disposal upon harnessing its untapped potential still looms large. An appropriate answer to such a predicament is an energy conversion technology that deems both economically and environmentally profitable. Pyrolysis of plastic wastes has been attempted for commercialisation unsuccessfully throughout the last decade, owing to the substandard economisation of the process and non-compliance of its products to emission standards.

Abstract: The relationship between the structure of zeolites and their performance in 1-octene conversion, a model compound in polyolefin plastic pyrolysis oil, has been elucidated. Zeolite topology determines reaction pathways being possible to direct the reaction to the formation of light olefins or aromatics. Small pore zeolites (≤ 6.1 Å), facilitate octene-cracking reactions. For example, MOR produces 98% of small olefins (54% C5). Large pore size zeolites catalyze aromatizations to BTX, also producing paraffins and hydrogen. Zeolites with pore sizes around 6.1 Å produce BTX with reduced coke formation. Thus, MFI produces 32% of C2-C5 olefins, 27% paraffins, and 23% of BTX. The olefins, paraffins, and BTX are found in an alkylation/dealkylation equilibrium conditioned by the catalyst’s pore size: the larger the pore size, the longer and more branched the products are.

Abstract: The increasing concern over plastic waste disposal has led researchers to explore sustainable methods for converting waste into valuable products. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste (PSW) using SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. SUZ-4 is synthesized from agricultural waste (rice husk), making it a more sustainable option. Results indicate that catalytic pyrolysis with SUZ-4 at a PSW-to-catalyst ratio of 1:0.033 at 350 °C produces an oil yield of 81.60 ± 1.62 %, containing 49.34 % styrene and 21.22 % α-methylstyrene. Under the same conditions, ZSM-5 yields 77.73 ± 1.24 % oil, with 33.18 % styrene and 18.58 % α-methylstyrene. In comparison, non-catalytic pyrolysis at 400 °C results in a 74.23 ± 1.25 % oil yield. These findings demonstrate that the type of catalyst significantly influences product distribution. Both SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolites have 10-membered ring pore systems, but their structural and acidic properties lead to different catalytic behaviors. SUZ-4’s weaker Brønsted acid sites limit excessive secondary cracking, enabling selective cracking. In contrast, ZSM-5 zeolite has stronger Brønsted acid sites and an open, interconnected pore network, which promotes deeper cracking and aromatization, resulting in many types of aromatic compounds in the oil products. Catalytic pyrolysis also reduces the viscosity of the oil compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Differences in chemical composition also affect fuel properties such as heating value, pH, and color.

Thus, this research aimed to comparatively investigate the production of alternative liquid fuels obtained from mixed plastics containing polystyrene (PS)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) at 20/5/35/40 (w/w) via non-catalytic cracking (under N2 atmosphere), non-catalytic hydrocracking (under H2 atmosphere), and catalytic hydrocracking over 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst conducted at an atmospheric pressure and 650 °C for 1 h. The product yields and chemical compositions (paraffins, olefins, aromatics and PAHs) in the liquid products generated from these processes were investigated and also compared to ones obtained from the non-catalytic processes of each plastic. Herein, the characteristics of 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was analyzed by N2-adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The results indicated that the non-catalytic processes of PS provided the highest content of oil and wax product (ca. 92 wt%). Whereas, the non-catalytic hydrocracking of the mixed plastics gave the lowest one (ca. 69 wt%). However, the catalytic hydrocracking over 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst (2.5 – 10.0 wt% based on the mixed plastics) could suppress the cracking and yielded the higher amount of oil and wax to ca. 76–80 wt%. To consider the chemical compositions in the liquid phase, the PAHs formation was relied on the aromatic structure in the feedstocks. The liquid product derived from the non-catalytic processes of PS contained the highest amount of PAHs compounds (2622–2926 ppm) followed by the mixed plastics. When the 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was applied to the catalytic hydrocracking of the mixed plastics, the amount of PAHs in the liquid product decreased from 1621 ppm to ca. 1000 ppm (30 – 40% PAHs reduction) without the reduction of heating value when compared to one obtained from the non-catalytic processes.",YES,NO,"Catalytic hydrocracking with Ni/SBA-15 catalyst focuses on PAH reduction and fuel quality improvement, not on plastic-specific oil fingerprinting.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: A meaningful and advanced method concerning the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) becomes a necessity, mainly due to their increased production, applications and their short life. Thermal methods have been an attractive option and for this reason the investigation of pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis as a potential method for the recycling of polycarbonate (PC) based plastics has been the aim of the current study. Nine different catalysts with variations in properties (such as porosity and acidity/basicity) were introduced in a bench scale pyrolysis system together with the polycarbonate polymeric material and the pyrolysis fractions were collected and analyzed. The liquid product consisted mainly of phenols and substituted phenols as well as the original monomer and, due to the commercial value of these products in the chemical industry, it is expected to enhance the economic viability of the process. Results showed a reduction in the degradation temperature in the presence of all catalytic materials, depending on the pore characteristics and the acidic nature of the solid. It seems that in the presence of the basic catalysts, PC degradation leads to lower molecular weight compounds and high phenolic fractions in the liquid produced. In terms of reduction in the production of the monomer, pore size rather than acidity appears to be the determining factor.",YES,YES,Polycarbonate single-polymer pyrolysis with detailed liquid product composition including phenols and substituted phenols reported via GC-MS or similar analysis.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: Valorization of waste polyolefins by a sequential combination of thermal pyrolysis and catalytic hydroconversion over a bifunctional metal/acid catalyst (e.g. zeolite) is an efficient route to produce transportation fuels. However, the zeolite strong acidity typically causes extensive cracking and loss of liquid fuels. In this work, mild dealumination with oxalic acid of a hierarchical Beta zeolite was used to achieve Ni 7%/h-Beta catalysts with Si/Al ratios within the 25 – 130 range. These catalysts were tested in the hydroconversion of a model mixture of LDPE thermal pyrolysis product (1-dodecene/n-dodecane, 50/50 w/w). The highest share of liquid fuels (∼ 90%) was achieved over 7% Ni/h-Beta (SiAl = 130). Besides, due to its high accessibility and tailored acidity, the product contained a meaningful amount of isoparaffins (12%) and a negligible content of olefins (< 3.5%).

Abstract: Thermal pyrolysis of different types of wastes including LDPE, carton, tire and poplar wood was conducted to investigate the effect of feedstock on the properties of products. The co-pyrolysis of single feedstocks was also the next trial. Zeolite (A4) was the catalyst. The reason for this was to study the influence of the catalyst on the products and also the effect of feedstock type on the structure of coke. The results showed that the type of feedstock could change the quantity and quality of the products significantly. Considering the average of the properties of the products obtained from the single feedstocks pyrolysis, the specification of the products obtained from the pyrolysis of mixture feedstock showed nonlinear changes. This indicated the cross-interaction of volatiles and non-volatiles through the secondary reactions during the co-pyrolysis process. Depending on the feedstock type, zeolite (A4) had different effects on the pyrolysis process. Zeolite (A4) increased the rate of cracking of large species and also their polymerization, but differently for different feedstocks. The nonlinearity of the change of the properties during the catalytic co-pyrolysis was observed.

Abstract: Accumulation of waste of plastic materials, formation of the oil sludge and hydrocarbons spills from household users and petroleum industries processes in nature, constitute a major danger for the environment whence, research of new effective techniques to expand the possibilities of the wastes recycling, is crucial. However, this paper focuses on the synthesis of bimetallic catalyst (BMC) based on Ni-Co supported on Al2O3 for the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and oil sludge (OS) samples in sub and supercritical water (sub- and SCW) for fuels and low carbon syngas production. Experiments were performed in a batch reactor at the temperatures and pressure ranges 350 – 410°C and 213.7 – 268.9 bars for 1 h. Characterization of the BMC and pyrolysis products was done by XRD, XRF, SEM-EDX, TGA, FTIR, GC-MS, GC and EPR methods, respectively. The findings reveal that the yield of the total gases, including unsaturated gases, increase with the pyrolysis temperature, and are composed by C1–C4, C2=C4, H2, CO and CO2. At a temperature of 380°C it is found that, the pyrolysis of the low density PE and that of PET-II, in the absence of BMC significantly generated the C2=C4, CO and CO2 up to 6.2, 33.14 and 48.34 mol.%, through a secondary cracking and decarboxylation of PET, respectively. It is found that, the composition of the resulting liquid product from pyrolysis of PET, is mostly composed of Benzoic acids, Biphenyl and that, the Benzoic acid catalyzes the reaction of CO2 formation itself, in the absence of BMC. Thus, use of BMC reduced the rate of CO and CO2 by 2.80 and 3.5 times while that of C1, H2 and ΣC2-C4 increased to maximal of 45 mol.%, 24.63 mol.% and 44.59 mol.%, respectively. Moreover, a high conversion rate of 58.46 wt% was achieved from the PE-I, and that of liquid hydrocarbons of 47.24 wt% observed for PE-IV, at 380°C in the presence of BMC. The results revealed that most of H2 source is essentially based on the water gas shift reaction and Sabatier's. Around 43–50 wt% of water was involved in the pyrolysis of PE, and that 0.4 % of Dodecadien-1-ol and 5 % of Decanedioic acid were detected only in the liquid product using the BMC.

Abstract: Pyrolysis products of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and municipal plastic waste at different reaction temperatures were predicted in the current study using a newly developed thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) method. The experiments revealed that pyrolysis products of LDPE and PP at 500 °C were almost wax. Above 600 °C, wax formed from LDPE and PP almost disappeared, while the production of light hydrocarbons was enhanced. In the cases of LDPE and PP, the benzene and toluene formations were clearly observed above 800 and 700 °C, respectively. For PS, styrene was observed as the major component at 500–800 °C. With increasing temperature, the formations of alkenes, benzene, and toluene were enhanced at the expense of styrene. Different from other plastics, PET produced a pyrolysis vapor containing mainly CO2 and CO. FT-IR spectra of PET were almost unchanged despite increasing temperature above 600 °C. In the case of municipal plastic waste, the product distribution was similar to those of LDPE and PP.

Abstract: A benign route for hydrogen (H2) production is environmentally desirable. To achieve this, H2 synthesis from polymeric waste was investigated. A new route was sought to maximize H2 production with the least formation of coke during catalytic pyrolysis of fishing net waste (FNW) by using CO2 (as reaction media) and a Ni/SiO2 (as catalyst). The thermolytic characteristics of FNW were also evaluated under the CO2 condition (and N2 as reference environment) both with and without catalysts to assess the full scope of variabilities involved in catalytic pyrolysis of FNW. The use of Ni/SiO2 catalyst in each of the N2 and CO2 conditions improved the reaction kinetics in terms of syngas formation with significant production of H2 (1,543 and 770 mmol g−1 cat h−1) and CO (11 and 1157 mmol g−1 cat h−1), respectively. However, H2 production rate dropped when the catalyst was deactivated due to (hydro)carbon deposition onto the catalyst surface under N2 environment. Under CO2 environment, CO2 served as an oxidant during FNW thermolysis with additional CO formation and prolonged lifetime of catalyst (via suppressed deactivation). H2 production mediated by CO2 increased to ≥1,093 mmol g−1 cat h−1 during five repeated cycles of FNW pyrolysis, coupling with water–gas shift reaction (WGS: CO + H 2 O ⇌ H 2 + CO 2 ). This new approach to H2 production is demonstrated as a practical measure for producing H2 while extending catalyst life.",YES,NO,Main target is hydrogen production with no reported oil composition or meaningful liquid product data.,TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

At optimal conditions of 450W microwave power and 100:1wt./wt. of PP (5g):graphite, nearly 48wt.% of oil with heating value of 44.45MJkg−1 was obtained along with 50wt.% of C3–C6 gaseous hydrocarbons. The scalability of the process was evaluated by pyrolyzing 50g of PP under the above conditions, which resulted in 83% energy recovery in the oil. While alkenes and cycloalkanes constituted a major fraction in the oil, their relative yields varied significantly with different susceptors suggesting that the susceptors also acted as catalysts and interacted with the polymer besides transferring the incident microwave energy.

Abstract: Gasoline-like hydrocarbon products obtained from the distillation of different pyrolysis oils produced from solid wastes of polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and their blends were investigated as these materials together form a good candidate for providing gasoline with properties approaching or fulfilling standard requirements in various countries. A laboratory-scale batch reactor equipped with reflux was used in this research, while the gasoline fractions of pyrolysis oils processed by distillation were further analyzed by GC-MS.

Abstract: Developing continuous-flow pyrolysis reactor systems is essential to meet the increasing demand for plastic pyrolysis oil. Most literature polymer pyrolysis kinetic studies use non-isothermal thermal gravimetric (TG) equipment or batch systems. Most systems are characterized by prolonged heating times. This may lead to significant polymer conversion before reaching the isothermal temperature, affecting the kinetic measurements. We present a novel, affordable, copper-block semi-batch reactor system that reaches the desired reaction temperature in less than four minutes. Through simulation, we demonstrate the superiority of this system over the commonly used stainless-steel reactors. We utilized this system to measure the isothermal kinetics of PE pyrolysis at temperatures between 411 and 449 °C. Employing a discrete lump methodology, we identified a five-lump reaction model: three polymer chains with descending molecular weights (S1, S2, S3), liquid (L), and gas (G), with reactions progressing in series and then in parallel. The initial decomposition steps exhibited similar activation energies of 360 ± 17 and 357 ± 6 kJ/mol, indicating that molecular weight has little effect on the initial PE pyrolysis rate.

Abstract: Recovery of plastic waste is becoming crucial since the amount of such waste increases continuously. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the pyrolysis technique for the recovery of plastic waste. In that frame, the influence of temperature (550°C or 600°C) on the pyrolysis of pure polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was first studied. It is shown that whatever the type of polymer, aromatic compounds are mainly formed and could reach 55wt.-% of the oil fraction for PP and 31wt.-% for PE at 550°C. In a second step, a PP/PE mixture and a model mixture representative of the packaging plastic waste stream were pyrolyzed to investigate the influence of a combination of polymers on the proportions and composition of the different fractions. The pyrolysis of the polymer mixtures shows that, even if the aromatic compounds formed are similar to those obtained for the virgin polymers, the proportion of aromatic compounds is much more important than when the polymers are pyrolyzed alone. Indeed, mixing PE with PP at a 50/50 ratio does not affect the amount of liquid, gas and solid fractions but leads to the formation of a higher quantity of xylene (39 wt-%) at 550°C. The combination of the plastics in the model mixture has also led to a decrease of the amount of waxy compounds. Furthermore, it was shown that a higher amount of aromatics than expected was formed. As a conclusion, this study demonstrates that pyrolysis is an effective technique to recover plastic waste as aromatic compounds for the petroleum industry. In the specific conditions used in this study (proposed model mixture and pyrolysis conditions), it will favor the idea that sorting is not needed to recover plastic waste through pyrolysis since aromatics formation is favored when the stream is composed of a mixture of polymers.",YES,YES,"Single polymer pyrolysis of PP, PE, PS, and PET with detailed GC-MS-derived oil composition data, including aromatic compound distribution and yield at different temperatures.",SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA

The co-pyrolysis of blends was distinguished into three stages, with a negative interaction observed in the first stage and positive interactions found in second and third stages. Besides, in the bubbling fluidized bed experiments, the liquid phase product yield first elevated and then reduced with rising temperature, and a high temperature promoted the degradation of oxygen-containing compounds and enhanced aromatics generation.

Abstract: Chemical upcycling of plastic waste from landfills to value-added products offers both economic and environmental benefits. Reported here is a simple method to convert high-density polyethylene (HDPE) into upcycled waxes in a very high yield (up to 93%). This selectivity is achieved by reducing the degradation temperature of HDPE via the addition of an inexpensive and reusable sodium chloride. These upcycled waxes had performance comparable to those of commercial rheology modifiers. In addition, kraft paper coated with these upcycled waxes exhibited excellent water- and oil resistance. A preliminary revenue analysis showed that this innovation allows plastic-to-wax to conversion with a three-fold revenue benefit over traditional ways of producing pyrolysis waxes from plastics. Also, sodium chloride reduces the pyrolysis temperature, thus reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting cleaner production, a circular economy, and generating less environmental pollution.

Abstract: The application of biochar as microwave absorbers in microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) has been widely studied. It has been reported that coconut husk carbon (CHC) showed good process characteristics and product distribution as microwave absorbers. However, the existing studies did not pay much attention to the reusability of CHC absorbers. In this study, the CHC absorbers prepared from agricultural and forestry wastes were reused in multiple cycles in the MACFP of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Compared with typical microwave absorbers such as spherical silicon carbide (SiC) and granular activated carbon (GAC), CHC demonstrated favorable process characteristics with relatively high heating rate (29 °C/min) and short heating time (within 12 min). In terms of product properties, the highest liquid yield of 51.67 wt% and the highest content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) of 82.82 % were obtained at the appropriate pyrolysis temperature (550 °C). After five consecutive uses, the CHC bed still produced comparable heating profiles and product distributions, compared to that of SiC. At the same time, a positive synergistic effect between PET and LDPE was observed. The co-feeding of PET and LDPE (50L50P) appropriately increased the liquid yield (42.50 wt% vs 38.75 wt%) and the relative content of MAHs (77.11 % vs 72.96 %) in comparison to their theoretical value. Finally, this study supplies a new strategy for utilizing recycled CHC as a microwave absorber for the treatment of hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-deficient mixed plastic wastes to produce MAHs products, which also reduces waste and realizes energy conversion.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis of PET and LDPE with biomass-derived absorber, focused on MAH production rather than plastic-specific oil fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Catalytic upcycling offers a promising route to valorize end-of-life polyolefins as high-value chemicals, yet significant challenges remain. Adjusting the hierarchical porosity and acidity of composites can effectively enhance polyolefins cracking efficiency. Thus, systematically studying their effects on cracking performance is essential. In the presented work, the interconnected NZ@Al-meso-SiO2 composites are synthesized for the efficient tandem catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into light olefins (C2-C4). By adjusting the ZSM-5/meso-SiO2 mass ratio and the Si/Al atomic ratio, the impact of hierarchical porosity and acidity on product distribution was systematically investigated. The results indicated that medium ZSM-5/meso-SiO2 mass ratio (n = 0.3) facilitates the tandem cracking of LDPE and enhances mass transfer. The Al-meso-SiO2 component selectively pre-cracks LDPE into intermediates and subsequently timely diffusion and deep cracking of the intermediates in nanosized ZSM-5, ultimately converting into C2-C4 olefins. The low Si/Al ratio (50) demonstrates a high acid density and the Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) acid ratio, exhibits greater selectivity for light olefins compared to a higher Si/Al ratio. The optimized NZ@Al-meso-SiO2-0.3–50 delivers an impressive performance, achieving ∼50 wt% light olefin yields at 550 °C within just 15 min. This exceptional activity and selectivity significantly surpass conventional single-component catalysts, physical mixtures, as well as exceeding results reported in the literature.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of plastics has gained more attention recently due to the advantages of environmental protection and energy conversion. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied under high heating rate conditions to investigate pyrolysis behaviors and find the most suitable kinetic reaction mechanisms. The TG and DTG curves for LDPE were similar to those for PP, but different from those for PVC. It was found that high heating rate led to the shifting of initial, end and peak temperatures to higher values. The FTIR results showed the main products of LDPE and PP were alkanes and alkenes, and the major products of PVC were HCl, alkenes and a small number of aromatic compounds. A comparative study of model-free methods like Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Friedman method were discussed to calculate activation energy. Kinetic reaction mechanisms were predicted by using model-fitting methods including Coats-Redfern and Criado method.

Abstract: Polymeric-coated aluminium scrap obtained from a local recycling plant in Thailand was used as raw material. The thermal decomposition behavior and evolved gas from the pyrolysis of the polymeric fraction coated on the aluminium surface were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS). Initially, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to study the thermal decomposition of all the coated aluminium scraps (white, black, and brown color). From the TGA results, a major thermal degradation at 300–480 °C associated with the decomposition of the polymeric fraction was found in all the powder-coated samples. The weight loss was 4.57 wt %, 3.56 wt %, and 1.64 wt % in the white-, black-, and brown-coated scraps, respectively. Then, the pyrolysis of the polymeric layer coated on the surface was investigated using a Py-GC/MS. The effect of pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C) and the type of coated aluminium scrap on product selectivity was studied. In terms of pyrolysis, the polymeric materials used in the coating would decompose via scission reaction generating volatile compounds. At a temperature of 600 °C, the carboxylic end groups (40.46–45.62 %) and aliphatic HCs (19.69–25.34 %) were the major pyrolytic products with a small number of aromatic HCs (2.76–7.76 %). In addition, low fractions of N-containing compounds (3.05–8.08 %) produced from the decomposition of cross-link agents were found. The maximum temperature (600°C) promoted high selectivity of hydrocarbons (aromatic and aliphatic) from β-H scission, cracking, and deoxygenation reactions. Aliphatic hydrocarbons consisted of alkenes, alkynes, and cycloalkenes with carbon in the range of C5–C24, while aromatic hydrocarbons with carbon in the range of C6–C20 were composed of mainly toluene, biphenyl, styrene, etc. These organic products can be utilized as chemical raw materials as well as alternative fuel. Additionally, to identify the remaining components after heat treatment at 600 °C, the chemical analysis was performed using the EDX technique. The residue compositions after heat treatment at 600 °C were C, Ti, Ba, Pb, Si, Ca, Fe, and S, chiefly corresponding to TiO2, SiO2, CaO, Fe2O3 as pigments and BaSO4 as a filler.

Abstract: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), commonly used to encapsulate photovoltaic (PV) modules, deteriorates on prolonged exposure to sunlight. In this work, fresh and deteriorated EVA samples prepared by UV irradiation (500 W m−2) over different periods (0–168 h) are characterized by conventional elemental analysis, microscopic observations, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and micro-UV irradiation combined Py-GC/MS (UV/Py-GC/MS) to investigate the deterioration behavior of EVA, using in-situ identification of gases liberated during UV irradiation, such as H2O, CO2, ketones, acetic acid, and lactones. In addition, the deterioration of the thermal stability on aging is confirmed using evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS). UV/Py-GC/MS revealed that acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, γ-butyrolactone, succinic anhydride, and cyclobutanone are produced during UV irradiation. In addition, Py-GC/MS identified cyclopentanone, citraconic anhydride, γ-valerolactone, and cyclobutanone from the UV deteriorated EVA samples, which suggested the presence of ketone and lactone structures in the deteriorated EVA.

Abstract: The rejected fraction of post-consumer plastics collected by mechanical sorting is a source of chemical recycling by processes such as pyrolysis, promoting the circular economy. The char residue produced in this process has been valorized, reinforcing the introduction in the consumption chain, as an adsorbent aimed at the upgrading of a biogas stream. The char was activated with KOH (496 m2 g−1) and the surface of the material was enriched with nitrogen groups (6% wt. by XPS) to raise the CO2 uptake. KOH and urea were used following different strategies, demonstrating that sequential activation and modification is the most efficient approach. Although the surface area was decreased after N insertion, i.e. from 497 to 389 m2 g−1, the CO2 uptake was raised. Specifically, comparing the CO2 uptake per micropore surface was considerably improved after urea functionalization (0.351 vs 0.235 mg m−2).

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising technique for converting waste plastics into oil, but the resulting liquid often contains halogens, particularly chlorine, which pose environmental and corrosion risks when used as fuel or refinery feedstock. These halogens primarily originate from materials such as PVC and other Cl-containing compounds present in the waste. This study evaluates the performance of several zeolites (TNU-9, MCM-22, MCM-49, MCM-56, and MCM-36) in the catalytic dehalogenation and upgrading of a real pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastics with a chlorine content of 290 ppm. Experiments were conducted using a fixed-bed catalytic reactor at 450 °C. All the tested catalysts improved the oil properties, decreasing its paraffin content and favouring the formation of aromatic, cyclic and olefinic hydrocarbons. This is positive regarding the possible use of this oil fraction in the formulation of transportation fuels or as a source of raw chemicals. The deepest modification was observed over MCM-36 zeolite, achieving the highest cracking activity into light olefins (mainly C3 and C4). Its superior performance is attributed to its high external surface area, mesopore volume, and accessible Brønsted acid sites, resulting from its pillarized structure. Moreover, MCM-36 was also the zeolite exhibiting the best oil dechlorination capability, which remained relatively stable along the time on stream in contrast to other zeolite catalysts. Analyses of the spent catalysts indicated that the deposited carbonaceous matter accumulates most of the Cl-containing species removed from the oil; hence, the overall oil upgrading process can be considered a combination of catalytic and adsorption effects.

Abstract: The increasing production of waste plastics poses significant environmental and health risks. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a major component of plastic waste, is a high-quality feedstock for pyrolysis due to its high carbon and hydrogen content. Traditional pyrolysis methods, such as thermal cracking and one-step catalytic pyrolysis, have limitations in yield and selectivity of valuable products like light olefins.

Abstract: An integrated reactor/separation semi-batch catalytic pyrolysis reactor system, based on a distillation approach, was developed to produce gaseous hydrocarbons, to be used as feedstock or fuel in the perspective of a Circular Economy approach. This work intends to be a proof of concept and to test the operating conditions and performance of the reactor to control the molecular weight of the products. For that purpose, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were run using high density polyethylene (HDPE) under several experimental conditions. Different temperatures were used (400, 450 and 500 °C) for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, with 1% (w/w) of HZSM-5. The influence of the temperature of the coolant at the outlet of the reactor was also investigated for the catalytic degradation of the HDPE at 450 °C, providing a way to control the average molecular weight of the recovered products, which increased with increasing coolant temperature. The focus of the study was to develop an integrated reactor/separation system where only the lighter compounds produced could leave the reactor and thus direct the production to chemical feedstock to be reused in petrochemistry, including in the production of new plastics. The analysis of the volatile products indicated that, for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, the products obtained were within the range of C2 to C8. Higher amounts of C3 to C5 were formed, with a particular emphasis on olefins, with very high yields in the case of catalytic pyrolysis. The activity of the catalysts after use was also checked through the ARDT index (Ability to Reduce the Decomposition Temperature), with values for this index above 50% which indicate a good possibility for reuse of the catalyst.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on light olefin production for petrochemical feedstock, with minimal emphasis on liquid oil composition or yield, and no reported detailed oil fingerprint data.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Coprocessing reactions with waste plastics, petroleum residues and coal were performed to determine the individual and blended behavior of these materials using lower pressure and cheaper catalysts.

The thermodegradative behavior of polypropylene (PP) and PP/petroleum residues/coal blends were investigated in the presence of solid hydrocracking (HC) catalysts.

Abstract: The research of pyrolytic thermodegradation of plastic wastes has received much attention. However, detailed combustion behavior and pyrolysis kinetics of microplastics are still absent in the current research. Understanding the characteristics and kinetics of microplastic pyrolysis is vital for designing and optimizing operational conditions. Adding silica to high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastics can effectively avoid the agglomeration of microplastics during pyrolysis, thereby better elucidating their thermodegradation. In the experiment, HDPE microplastics are mixed with SiO2 at different weight ratios (10 %, 20 %, 50 %, 70 %, and 100 %) to observe the dispersion effect on the microplastic thermodegradation. The results suggest that less than 20 % of PE in the mixture can retain microplastic pyrolysis characteristics. In combustion analysis, 10 % PE undergoes a faster thermo-oxidation reaction than pure HDPE. This study applies the independent parallel reaction (IPR) model and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to investigate microplastic pyrolysis kinetics. The pyrolysis activation energy is between 273.89 and 292.90 kJ‧mol−1, with fit quality high than 95 %, and rises with decreasing dispersion degree and increasing heating rate.

Abstract: Thermo-chemical conversion is a promising technology for the recycle of waste plastics, as it can produce high-value products such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen. However, the low yield of CNTs is one of the challenges. In this work, the addition of Mn (0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.%) to Fe-based catalyst to improve the production of CNTs has been investigated. Results show that the increase of Mn content from 0 wt.% to 10 wt.% significantly promotes CNTs yield formed on the catalyst from 23.4 wt.% to 32.9 wt.%. The results show that Fe-particles in the fresh catalysts are between 10−25 nm. And the addition of Mn in the Fe-based catalyst enhanced the metal-support interactions and the dispersion of metal particles, thus leading to the improved catalytic performance in relation to filamentous carbon growth. In addition, the graphitization of CNTs is promoted with the increase of Mn content.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of lignin with representative waste plastics, including polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), was investigated, focusing on radical-mediated reactions, with radical detection via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). During the co-pyrolysis of lignin with PP, favorable synergistic effects were observed, resulting in a significant 17 % enhancement in phenolic compound yields within the fixed-bed reactor, whereas the presence of other plastics led to exacerbated cross-linking carbonization in contrast. Furthermore, TOF-MS and FT-ICR-MS analyses corroborated that the bio-oil derived from lignin/PP exhibited a higher phenolic content and lower carbon number distribution. Additionally, the radical concentrations in bio-oil of lignin/PP were determined to be the lowest (1.07 × 1013 spins/µL), providing compelling evidence of the strong interaction between lignin and PP. Interestingly, EPR spectroscopy detected the resultant lowest spin concentrations (1.28 × 1019 spins/g) in lignin/PP char, in contrast to lignin in isolation or within other plastics, which strongly indicating that hydrogen-rich radicals originating from PP were responsible for inducing more effective quenching reactions with lignin intermediates. Moreover, the lignin/PP char demonstrated the highest carbon content (80.30 %) and the lowest ID/IG ratio (1.98), further affirming a highly effective interaction between lignin and PP.

Abstract: This research investigates the formation mechanism of soot and particulate matter during the pyrolysis and gasification of waste derived from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a laboratory scale drop tube furnace.

High reaction temperatures promote the formation of hydrocarbon gaseous products and their conversion to PAHs, which ultimately leads to the formation of soot particles. The soot particles generated by waste derived from MSW pyrolysis and gasification both have high specific surface area and well-developed pore structure. Compared with pyrolysis, the soot generated by gasification of waste derived from MSW had smaller size and higher proportion of inorganic components. The higher pyrolysis temperature led to the collapse of the mesoporous structure of submicron particles, resulting in a decrease in total pore volume and an increase in specific surface area.

Abstract: In order to close the loop in chemical recycling via pyrolysis, products must meet strict limits for halogen content to be used in conventional petrochemical processes. By integrating dechlorination as an integral part of pyrolysis, results show that the efficiency of dechlorination, both via stepwise pyrolysis and dechlorination agents, is significantly decreased in the presence of PET or cellulose in the feedstock. Product analysis showed that Cl reacts with formed oxygenated substances, some of which remain in the reactor during the 1st step at 350 °C and subsequently pass into the final liquid product. This increases the requirements for applied dechlorinating agents during the 2nd pyrolysis step. Novel agents have to therefore cope with a wide range of chlorinated hydrocarbons. By combining acidic β-zeolite with alkali hydrotalcite in a 1:1 ratio, a synergic effect towards dechlorination was observed, increasing individual efficiency by about 12% and 6%, respectively. Combining stepwise pyrolysis, which removed 38% of Cl on average, with the mentioned mixture of agents, 95% efficiency and 12.2 ± 1.2 ppm of Cl were obtained in the final liquid product.

Abstract: Renewable lignocellulosic biomass is a favorable energy resource since its co-pyrolysis with hydrogen-rich plastics can produce high-yield and high-quality biofuel. In contrast to earlier co-pyrolysis research that concentrated on increasing product yield, this study comprehends the synergistic effects of two distinct feedstocks that were not considered earlier. This work focuses on co-pyrolyzing wheat straw (WS) with non-reusable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for the production of pyrolysis oil. WS and PET were blended in different ratios (100/0, 80/20, 60/40, 40/60, 20/80, and 0/100), and pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor under different temperatures to assess their synergistic effect on oil yield. Synergy rates of up to 7.78 % were achieved on yield for the blends of plastic and biomass at a temperature of 500 °C. In comparison to individual biomass or plastics, co-pyrolyzing PET-biomass blends demonstrated good process interaction and promoted the yields of value-added products. The heating value of the pyrolysis oils was in the range of 16.45–28.64 MJ/kg, which depends on the amount of plastic present in the feedstock. The physical analysis of the oils shows that they can be used for heat production by direct combustion in boilers or furnaces. The correlation between WS and PET was validated with the aid of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The GC-MS result demonstrated the presence of different compounds such as O-H compounds, esters, carbonyl group elements, acids, hydrocarbons, aromatics, and nitrogenated compounds in the pyrolysis oil, which differed based on the proportions of PET in the feedstock. The increased hydrocarbon and reduced oxygen percentages in the pyrolysis oil were implicitly caused by enhanced hydrocarbon pool mechanisms, in which the breakdown of PET may be supplied as a hydrogen donor.

Abstract: This study explores the valorization of pyrolysis waxy residue (PWR), a semi-solid byproduct remaining after the distillation of lighter fractions from paper and plastic waste derived pyrolysis oil, with the aim of optimizing hydrocarbon production. Three strategies were assessed: (1) co-pyrolysis of PWR with sawdust (SD) at varying ratios, (2) catalytic pyrolysis using molecular sieves (MS) and ZSM-5 catalysts, and (3) catalytic co-pyrolysis combining PWR, SD, and catalysts. Thermal decomposition analysis of the PWR revealed maximum volatile release, with complete conversion achieved at 550 °C. Kinetic parameters were estimated using Coats Redfern method and the activation energy was found in the range of 31.3 – 38.9 mol−1 (avg: 35.3 mol−1). Non catalytic fixed-bed co-pyrolysis at the optimum temperature of 550 ˚C showed a 3:1 PWR-to-SD ratio maximizing the hydrocarbon content (79.0 %) but resulted in low oil yields of (∼13 %,). In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis of PWR with MS resulted in a significantly higher hydrocarbon yield with negligible phenolic compounds, while ZSM-5 enhanced the gas production to 32.5 % but slightly reduced hydrocarbon yield to 65.9 %.

Abstract: In this work, the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of different types of plastic waste and a real mixture were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor over different catalysts (CaO, MgO, HY, HZSM-5). Important differences in gas, liquid, and solid yields were found as a function of polymer type. The highest gas yield was obtained with expanded polystyrene (52.3%), and the maximum oil production with high-impact polystyrene (55.5%), while polypropylene film led to the highest char release (17.5%). Regarding the composition of the liquid oil, high-impact polystyrene showed the highest yield of gasoline-range product (426 g per kg of pyrolyzed plastic), mainly composed of aromatics compounds (90%). The addition of catalysts increased the gas yield to the detriment of the oil produced. The effect was more evident for zeolite-type catalysts, i.e., the gas yield raised from 43.3 (non-catalytic) to 51.5% (HZSM-5). Low influence on the oil composition, i.e., gasoline-range product, was detected. This can be explained by the fast deactivation of catalysts because of coke deposition.

Abstract: The thermal degradation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) has been investigated in different gas atmospheres by simultaneous thermogravimetry—mass spectrometry, pyrolysis—gas chromatography, combined gas chromatography—mass spectrometry, and IR analysis. There are no significant differences in the decomposition products of the two polymers in helium or air at a temperature range of 450–790°C; C1 to C8 fluorocarbons and their oxidized products have been identified.

From the traces of the TG-MS in an atmosphere of helium, the FEP clearly decomposes in two stages. The first stage degradation is mostly attributed to the evolution of perfluoropropylene with a small amount of perfluoro-1-butene or perfluoroisobutylene, and possibly traces of perfluorocyclobutane. Tetrafluoroethylene is evolved with these fluorocarbons at the second stage degradation, showing similar characteristics of the degradation mechanisms of FEP at the two stages.

Abstract: This study examined the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate over basic calcium oxide and acid zeolites, such as HY (SiO2/Al2O3: 30), Hβ (25), HZSM-5 (23), to maximize the yields of aromatics using thermogravimetric analysis and tandem μ-reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The maximum decomposition temperature of polyethylene terephthalate on the catalytic thermogravimetric analysis over HZSM-5 (452 °C) was reduced by co-feeding with yellow poplar wood to 444 °C because of its catalytic property and the effective interaction between the catalytic co-pyrolysis intermediates of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate. Non-catalytic co-pyrolysis produced smaller amounts of large molecular polyethylene terephthalate pyrolyzates because of the more effective secondary cracking and deoxygenation. Calcium oxide was effective in the deacidification and acid zeolites were efficient in aromatics production during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate. Among the acid zeolites, HZSM-5 showed the highest efficiency on benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEXs) production, followed by Hβ and HY because of its strong acidity and proper pore size.

Abstract: The resource treatment and recycling of waste wind turbine blades (WWTBs) have become an important challenge globally. Considering mechanical strength during operation, the designed construction of WTBs consists of B1 (balsa-filled part), B2 (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam-filled part) and B3 (pure glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) part), whereas direct mixed treatment can generate low-quality and heterogeneous products. Current studies focused on B3 or the whole blades, but few studied the pyrolysis behavior and energy value of different parts. In this study, the comparative study of the kinetic, product distribution and evolution, and economics of different parts was conducted. Thermogravimetric and kinetic revealed the phase transitions and energy requirements during conversion. Py-GC/MS and fixed-bed experiments confirmed that B1 and B2 generated more oils and gases with more coke in the solids at 600 °C, which was related to carbonization of their core components. High O/C ratios of balsa and PET caused more oxygen-containing groups and products to be produced in the B1 and B2 reaction pathways. The high economics indicated that pyrolysis was suitable for B2 and B3, and the detailed exploration of B1 part should be continued.

Abstract: Polylactic acid has been adopted as a strategic alternative to petroplastics because of its biodegradability. The waste generation rate could be proportional to its use, considering the short lifespan of polylactic acid. However, a practical disposal or recycling protocol for polylactic acid waste has not yet been developed. Thus, this study suggests a promising thermochemical platform for valorizing polylactic acid waste into energy resources (syngas). Specifically, carbon dioxide-assisted pyrolysis has been suggested to impart environmental features to polylactic acid disposal. Before the pyrolysis tests, the polylactic acid waste sample was characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectrometer and thermogravimetric analyses, which showed that polylactic acid contained a substantial amount of additives and impurities (∼13 wt%). The impurity containing polylactic acid was converted into pyrogenic gases and biocrudes through pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis was performed under carbon dioxide condition and led to enhanced carbon monoxide formation from simultaneous homogeneous reactions between CO2 and volatile organic compounds evolved from thermal degradation of polylactic acid. CO2 was reduced and the volatile compounds were oxidized. The evolution of carbon monoxide from pyrolysis under carbon dioxide condition was 2 times higher than that from nitrogen condition. The concentration of carbon monoxide from the pyrolysis of polylactic acid waste with respect to plastics and biomass was considerably higher. This observation indicates that the susceptibility of carbon dioxide to the homogeneous reaction is highly sensitive. To seek a way to hasten the homogeneous reaction, silica supported nickel catalysts were applied.

Abstract: Presently, there is a growing need for handling automobile shredder residues – ASR or “car fluff”. One of the most promising methods of treatment ASR is pyrolysis.

Unfortunately, not much work has been reported providing a solution for treatment the wastes after pyrolysis. This work proposes a new system based on a two-staged process.

Abstract: Iron-modified zeolite catalyst has a good application prospect on recycling the waste plastics into value-added fuels via catalytic pyrolysis. Distinguishing the catalytic activities of varied iron states on catalyst is crucial to catalyst designation and plastic-to-fuel process. In this work, we prepared three Fe/USY catalysts, termed Fe(O-550)/USY, Fe(R-300)/USY and Fe(R-450)/USY, that contain different iron states – Fe2O3, Fe3O4 + Fe (dominantly) and Fe respectively, and investigated their catalytic activities in polyethylene pyrolysis for fuel oils. The results show that loading of the iron species on USY zeolite decreases the catalyst acidity. H2 reduction treatment in catalyst preparation has no significant influence on the total acidity but slightly changes the concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The oil yield after catalysis with different catalysts follows the order: Fe(O-550)/USY (72.5 %) > Fe(R-300)/USY (69.9 %) > Fe(R-450)/USY (66.7 %) > USY (56.5 %). The oil includes a mixture of C6-C34 compounds especially abundant in C6-C10. It is mainly in gasoline and diesel range and consists of alkanes as majority. Generally, loading of the iron species on USY zeolite increases the oil yield and produces lighter oil and more aromatics and alkenes, while the Fe(R-450)/USY shows higher catalytic cracking activity than Fe(O-550)/USY, Fe(R-300)/USY and USY catalysts.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using iron-based metal-acid catalysts is a promising waste-to-energy technology to deliver clean renewable fuels. While these catalysts show valid catalytic activity during pyrolysis, their ability to guide tandem reactions over metal and acid sites remains uncertain. In this study, we employ the Fe2O3/USY catalysts to recycle polyethylene (PE) into liquid fuels, and demonstrate the tandem catalysis of the Fe2O3/USY catalysts during PE depolymerization. The highest fuel oil yield obtained was 78.1 % after Fe2O3/USY catalysis (5 % Fe loading, Si/Al ratio = 80). The resulting oil predominantly falls within the gasoline range, with a carbon number distribution rich in C5–C9 range. The oil composition comprises 71.3 % olefins and 16.7 % paraffins, mostly isomeric, while few aromatics were obtained. Comparative experiments confirm that PE depolymerization over the metal and acid sites of Fe2O3/USY catalysts involves an olefin-intermediate tandem pathway: the Fe2O3 enhances olefin-intermediate generation through its dehydrogenation activity, while the USY allows these olefin-intermediates to undergo further cleavage over the acid sites. Although the Fe2O3 loading on USY enhances PE cracking by facilitating olefin-intermediate generation in tandem catalysis, the reduced acidity inhibits PE cracking. Therefore, when aiming for oil production via PE pyrolysis, the delicate balance between reduced acidity and increased dehydrogenation activity after Fe2O3 loading must be taken into account.",YES,YES,Pure polyethylene pyrolysis with detailed oil composition (GC-based olefin/paraffin distribution) and yield data reported.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Overall, the study aims at progressing towards the fine-tuning of the pyrolysis-reforming technology by co-feeding O2. Thus, a multi-point O2 injection system has been developed to ensure a suitable O2 distribution in the reforming reactor and avoid the formation of hot spots, as they may cause catalyst deactivation by metal sintering. Moreover, as O2 is directly supplied into the catalytic bed, pre-combustion of the volatile stream before contacting the catalyst is avoided and in-situ coke combustion is promoted.

Abstract: Globally increasing concern related to municipal solid waste generation is encouraging research efforts on developing alternative routes to valorize mixed refused wastes. In this way, catalytic pyrolysis is emerging as an interesting and efficient technology due to its great flexibility in terms of feedstock. In the current work, upgrading of a Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) has been investigated by catalytic pyrolysis over nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolite (n-ZSM-5), paying special attention to dechlorination effects due to the high Cl content of the raw waste. Thus, pretreatment of the SRF by water washing and mild thermal processing allows for a significant reduction of the Cl concentration. Regarding the catalytic pyrolysis step, the best conditions correspond with a temperature of 400 °C in the catalyst bed and 0.50 catalyst/SRF mass ratio, which lead to ca. 30 wt% oil yield (rich in aromatic hydrocarbons) together with about 40 wt% gas yield (rich in C3–C4 olefins).

Abstract: Steam cracking in fluidized beds is an alternative method for producing valuable petrochemicals from plastic waste. Previous studies on the conversion of plastics in fluidized beds have revolved around non-catalytic cracking using silica sand as the bed material. On the other hand, studies on catalytic cracking have focused on the use of active materials such as olivine, bauxite, feldspar, and zeolites. The potential influence of the above-mentioned materials, in their natural or inactive state, on fluidized bed hydrocarbon cracking, is not well-documented in the literature. In this paper, steam cracking of polyethylene in a bubbling fluidized bed at 750 °C is investigated in the presence of four different natural ores: olivine, bauxite, silica sand, and feldspar. The paper compares the performance of the steam cracking process in terms of cracking severity, conversion, and product distribution among different hydrocarbon groups. The results show that there is only a marginal difference in cracking severity among the different bed materials, while the conversion remain relatively consistent, ranging from 93% to 95% (carbon.%). The yields of paraffins and carbon oxides are narrow, ranging from 15% to 16% and 3–4%, respectively, while the yields of light olefins and aromatics show a slightly wider range. The yield of olefins is in the range of 52–57%, and for aromatics, it ranges from 16% to 21%.

Abstract: A series of hydrotalcites with various Mg/Al contents were prepared by a solid state reaction. They were then calcined at 450℃ to form a series of Mgx-Aly-O catalysts with different Mg/Al ratios for use in the depolymerization of polystyrene (PS) in a batch reactor. The prepared catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), induced coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) measurements. The characterization results showed that the Mgx-Aly-O mixed metal oxide catalysts were successfully synthesized as attempted in this work. Basicity of Mgx-Aly-O catalysts was determined by CO2-TPD measurement to elucidate the catalytic performance in the depolymerization of PS. It was found that basicity and catalytic performance (PS conversion, oil yield, and styrene monomer (SM) yield) showed volcano-shaped trends with respect to the Mg/Al ratio of Mgx-Aly-O catalysts. Correlations between basicity and catalytic performance revealed that all of PS conversion, oil yield, and SM yield were improved with the increasing basicity. Among the catalysts tested, the Mg1-Al2-O (Mg/Al = 0.5) catalyst with the largest basicity showed the best catalytic performance.

Abstract: Compared to nitrogen (N2) as an inert medium, the weak oxidation characteristics of carbon dioxide (CO2) can induce the pre-depolymerization of macromolecular chains in waste tires (WTs) and waste plastics (WPs), simultaneously reducing pyrolysis energy consumption and increasing pyrolysis oil yield. In this paper, a comparative experimental system utilizing N2 and CO2 as carrier gases was constructed. A primary investigation was conducted on the co-pyrolysis process of WTs and WPs resulting from differences in carrier gases, and the targeted conversion of light products was systematically investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic analyses revealed that the CO2 medium reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier, driving a decrease in the initial pyrolysis temperature and activation energy. Notably, WPs (6.6 ℃, 36.3 kJ/mol) exhibited the most pronounced sensitivity to the carrier gas effect. The activation energy of the co-pyrolysis system showed a positive synergistic effect, decreasing by 3.9 kJ/mol in CO2 and 17.1 kJ/mol in N2 medium, respectively. The shifts of theoretical TG-DTG curves further confirmed that the N2-mediated synergistic strength was higher, but CO2 exhibited superior performance in reducing the kinetic energy barrier. Product characterization results indicated that the CO2 medium increased the C5-C12 fraction in the pyrolysis oil by 18.7 wt%, with the selectivity of aromatics and olefins increasing by 14.4 wt% and 13.5 wt%, respectively.

This research explores a transition metal free zeolite-based hierarchical composite, synthesized by incorporating SBA-15 in ZSM-5 framework, for efficient thermos-catalytic upcycling of polypropylene (PP).

Abstract: Pyrolysis is widely used as a waste treatment technology (thermal recycling), which can be an alternative to disposal in landfills. To investigate the applicability of pyrolysis of plastic solid waste (PSW) to recovery energy from plastic solid waste (PSW), the pyrolysis of PSW was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer under an inert condition. The PSW samples were heated under dynamic conditions from 25 °C to 1000 °C at four low heating rates (5, 10, 20, and 30 °C min−1). The decomposition behavior of pseudo-components was characterized by the deconvolution method using the asymmetric double sigmoidal function (Asym2Sig), and the data obtained were used to determine the kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by isoconversional methods, the compensation effect factor and master plot. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH and ΔS) and lifetime were estimated based on the thermogravimetric and kinetic data. In addition, a fixed-bed reactor and GC–MS were employed to identify some valuable products in pyrolytic oil. Three pseudo-components were identified, which had the main influence on pyrolytic performance. The kinetic parameters suggested the suitability of PSW pyrolysis, where the reaction models were found to be suitable for describing the thermal behavior of PSW pyrolysis.

Abstract: Three types of acrylonitrile copolymers (acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer (ABS 1 1 Acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer. ), acrylonitrile-styrene random copolymer (SAN 2 2 Acrylonitrile-styrene random copolymer. ) and acrylonitrile-butadiene random copolymer (BAN 3 3 Acrylonitrile-butadiene random copolymer. ) were studied by thermogravimetry (TG/DTG 4 4 Thermogravimetry. ) and by pyrolysis in a semi-batch process at 450 °C in order to find structure–thermal behaviour relationships. The overlapped thermo-oxidative degradation processes were separated and the corresponding kinetic parameters were calculated. The TG/DTG studies have evidenced that the styrene-acrylonitrile interactions stabilize the nitrile groups reacting by chain scission rather than cyclization and destabilize the styrene units. Also, the cyclization of the acrylonitrile units in ABS is favoured by interactions with the styrene and butadiene units. The pyrolysis behaviour evidenced that the styrene-acrylonitrile interactions in SAN and ABS lead to the formation of 4-phenylbutyronitrile as the most important decomposition compound.

Abstract: Thermal and catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using a screw kiln reactor provided with two zones of reaction temperature. Thermal degradation experiments carried out at different temperatures and screw speeds have shown that this continuous system is suitable for the LDPE degradation, product outputs up to c.a. 100 g/h being obtained. Compared to a conventional batch reactor, the screw kiln system leads to a lower formation of gaseous products, whereas overcracking of the heavy fractions is also reduced. These differences are probably originated by the intimate contact and the same residence times for all the product fractions that exist within the screw reactor, which is in contrast with the selective and fast withdrawal of volatile products taking place in the batch system. In the catalytic experiments, a mesoporous MCM-41 type aluminosilicate has been used as catalyst, being continuously fed to the screw reactor mixed with the raw plastic material. In these conditions, yields up to 80% towards hydrocarbons within the gasoline range (C5C12) have been obtained.

Abstract: In accordance with global economic prosperity, the frequencies of food delivery and takeout orders have been increasing. The pandemic life, specifically arising from COVID-19, rapidly expanded the food delivery service. Thus, the massive generation of disposable plastic food containers has become significant environmental problems. Establishing a sustainable disposal platform for plastic packaging waste (PPW) of food delivery containers has intrigued particular interest. To comprise this grand challenge, a reliable thermal disposable platform has been suggested in this study. From the pyrolysis process, a heterogeneous plastic mixture of PPW was converted into syngas and value-added hydrocarbons (HCs). PPW collected from five different restaurants consisted of polypropylene (36.9 wt%), polyethylene (10.5 wt%), polyethylene terephthalate (18.1 wt%), polystyrene (13.5 wt%), polyvinyl chloride (4.2 wt%), and other composites (16.8 wt%). Due to these compositional complexities, pyrolysis of PPW led to formations of a variety of benzene derivatives and aliphatic HCs. Adapting multi-stage pyrolysis, the different chemicals were converted into industrial chemicals (benzene, toluene, styrene, etc.). To selectively convert HCs into syngas (H2 and CO), catalytic pyrolysis was adapted using supported Ni catalyst (5 wt% Ni/SiO2). Over Ni catalyst, H2 was produced as a main product due to CH bond scission of HCs. When CO2 was used as a co-reactant, HCs were further transformed to H2 and CO through the chemical reactions of CO2 with gas phase HCs. CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis also retarded catalyst deactivation inhibiting coke deposition on Ni catalyst.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on syngas production and catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons to syngas using CO2, with no reported detailed oil composition or focus on liquid product fingerprinting.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

The experiments started with fabrication of membranes loaded with 0.04 wt% of CNTs and graphene (GNs). The elemental analysis and proximate analysis of the fabricated membranes were studied. Subsequently, thermogravimetric coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) system was used to study the thermal and chemical decomposition of the membranes at different heating rates (5-30˚C/min). The volatile products released from the pyrolysis process of the membranes were analyzed using TG coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) unit. Finally, pyrolysis kinetic parameters of PES membrane and its nanocomposites were studied using model-free models. Also, thermogravimetry and differential thermal gravimetry (TG/DTG) experimental data were simulated using the distributed activation energy model and the independent parallel reactions kinetic model with high predictability.

Abstract: A two-stage reaction process was used to convert polypropylene (PP) into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and hydrogen-rich gas.

The resultant gas mainly consisted of hydrogen and methane. SEM and TEM images revealed that carbon products in the moving-bed reactor were in the form of MWCNTs.

The influence of pyrolysis temperature (550–750 °C) and decomposition temperature (500–800 °C) on the performances of the two-stage reaction system were investigated.

The effect of ex-situ application of HZSM-5 and its metal modified versions (MZSM-5s) on organic liquid product (OP) upgradation was explored. MZSM-5s were synthesized by adding metal (Co, Ni, Zn, and Fe) oxides to parent HZSM-5 catalyst through wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, and N2 physisorption. In the first phase, the effect of co-pyrolysis temperature (500–650 °C) on product distribution was evaluated. The liquid yield varied in the range of 49–55 wt%, with a maximum at 550 °C. In the second phase, results obtained from vapor catalyzed co-pyrolysis conducted at 550 °C showed that impregnation of HZSM-5 with metals resulted in relatively higher OP oil yield as compared to parent HZSM-5.

Abstract: Converting waste plastics directly into valuable aromatic chemicals is a promising, cost-effective recycling strategy. Traditional zeolite-catalyzed cracking of polyolefins to produce aromatics often needs high temperatures and faces issues like low selectivity for liquid aromatics, separation difficulties, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. To address this, a multifunctional Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was developed to efficiently upgrade various polyolefins—including polyvinyl chloride—into gaseous alkanes (C1–C5) and easily separable liquid aromatics (C6–C12) at 400 °C, without added solvents or hydrogen. Aromatic products make up 57.1 wt% of total output, with more than 97.8 % selectivity for the liquid phase and a BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity of 76.1 %. The high activity and selectivity for aromatics stem from synergistic interactions between Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and acid sites in the zeolite, which promote selective C–C bond breaking and control hydrogenolysis and aromatization pathways. This synergy allows precise control over the distribution of products by carbon number and favors the formation of separable aromatics. Notably, the catalyst also prevents coking by hydrogenolyzing and hydrogenating reactive intermediates before they form stable graphite-like deposits. Consequently, Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates excellent stability, maintaining consistent aromatics yield over 13 consecutive cycles and processing over 30 times its weight in plastics without regeneration. After regeneration, the activity of the catalyst was fully restored, highlighting its potential for industrial use.

Abstract: The catalytic cracking of polyolefin pyrolysis waxes has been studied under conditions that mimic the operation of a catalytic cracking unit (FCC). Two commercial catalysts of different properties were used. Yields and compositions of the lumps (dry gases, LPG, gasoline and coke) were compared with those corresponding to the actual feed in the refinery (vacuum gas-oil). The effect of process operating conditions (temperature and contact time) is significant. Catalyst acidity has a significant effect on conversion (at a temperature around 525°C) and on yields and compositions of lumps (in the 500–550°C range). The main effect of increasing catalyst acidity is an increase in coke content on the catalyst by decreasing the yield to dry gases. Due to the higher hydrogen transfer capacity, the gasoline obtained using the catalyst with higher acidity has a higher aromatic (especially C6–C8) and paraffinic content, and lower olefin content, being these two latter fractions less branched.

Abstract: The utilization of plastic solid wastes for sustainable energy production is a crucial aspect of the circular economy. This study focuses on pyrolysis as an effective method to convert this feedstock into renewable drop-in fuel. To achieve this, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of feedstock composition, pyrolysis process parameters, and the physicochemical characteristics of the resulting fuel, all correlated with engine combustion parameters. Considering this full value chain, this study provides the first unbiased and up-to-date benchmark of polypropylene and polystyrene pyrolysis oils (PPO and PSO) produced in an industrial-grade batch reactor. The pyrolysis process was optimized to achieve ultra-high liquid yield levels of 92% for PPO and 98% for PSO with minimum energy consumption. After post-processing, blending with diesel, and normative fuel analytics, combustion/emission tests involving 20 species preceded under fully controllable conditions using a state-of-the-art single-cylinder research engine. The fuel analysis results revealed significant disparities between the properties of PPO and PSO. PPO exhibited a diverse carbon structure, resulting in very low density and high volatility. On the other hand, PSO was predominantly composed of aromatics, leading to low viscosity and poor auto-ignition properties. Engine tests showed that PPO blends exhibited combustion characteristics similar to diesel, while PSO blends exhibited significant differences, particularly during the premixed combustion stage attributed to pilot injection. Following the combustion response, the addition of PPO had minimal impact on emissions, while PSO acted as an emission enhancer, resulting in over twofold increase in particulate matter at high loads. Consequently, PSO showed elevated carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions due to the higher contribution of aromatics. Ultimately, this study challenges the prevailing perception of plastic-derived fuels as “dirty”. By implementing feedstock segregation to minimize polystyrene content, it is possible to achieve a fossil substitute level of 40% while meeting all emission and safety regulations for diesel engines with a minimum economic burden.",YES,YES,PP and PS single-polymer pyrolysis with detailed oil composition and fuel property data from GC-MS and engine testing.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and low-rank coal is an effective way to realize resource recycling, while the chlorides released during the co-pyrolysis process would corrode the equipment and affect the product quality. Therefore, the synergistic effect and chlorine migration behavior of co-pyrolysis for Hami (HM) coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied through in situ pyrolysis time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-TOF-MS) and fix-bed experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC polymer (PVC-PO)/PVC pipes (PVC-P) and HM coal exhibits different synergistic effects on the co-pyrolysis products. The results of Py-TOF-MS suggested that co-pyrolysis promotes the reactions between small molecular fragments and the secondary reactions between volatiles, which accelerates the generation of MAHs and PAHs. However, the addition of HM coal inhibits the generation of polyene fragments and aromatics. These two effects are competitive for the aromatization reactions. Moreover, the additives in PVC-P improve the tar quality and lead to more than 0.86–1.82 % of the chlorine being fixed in co-pyrolysis char.

Abstract: The effects of pretreatment and structure of zeolite on aromatization of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) over different Ga-promoted zeolites (HZSM-5, hierarchical HZSM-5, HY, Hβ, and USY) were investigated. Hydrogen reduction of Ga-promoted HZSM-5 resulted in a higher yield of alkenes during HDPE pyrolysis but did not lead to increased production of total aromatic hydrocarbons. The reduction and subsequent oxidation of Ga/Z5 led to the formation of GaO+ species with high dehydrogenation activity. This resulted in a remarkable 65% yield of aromatics, with a BTEX (benzene, toluene ethylbenzene and xylene) overall yield of 60% and a selectivity of 90% of the liquid product. Increasing the Ga loading decreased the BTEX yield due to pore blockage and a decrease in the amount of Brønsted acid sites. The BTEX yield over Ga-promoted zeolites was found to be strongly related to the pore size of the zeolite, whereas its yield over the parent zeolite was not strongly dependent on the pore size.

We observed the following effects of PET on the pyrolysis of PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br mixed plastics: (i) the yield of liquid product decreased and the formation of gaseous products increased; (ii) a waxy residue was formed in addition to the solid carbon residue; (iii) the formation of SbBr3 was not detected in liquid products; (iv) the yield of chlorinated branched alkanes increased as well as vinyl bromide and ethyl bromide were formed. The use of calcium carbonate carbon composite (Ca-C) completely removed the chlorine and bromine content from the liquid products during PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br pyrolysis, however in the presence of PET, the catalytic experiment (Ca-C, 8g) yielded liquid products containing 310ppm of Br and 20ppm of Cl. In addition, the Ca-C increased the yield of liquid products about 3–6wt.%, as well as enhanced the gaseous product evolution and decreased the yield of residue.

Abstract: The release of chlorine during the pyrolysis of actual municipal plastic waste (MPW) was studied. Firstly, thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) was analyzed to investigate the chlorine release behavior. Then, the effect of temperature on chlorine migrations was investigated by fast pyrolysis experiments in a fixed bed reactor. Results showed that chlorine released mainly between 241 and 353 °C in the form of HCl or chloroesters during MPW pyrolysis. After pyrolysis, chlorine was mainly distributed in the pyrolytic gas (74.34–82.89 %) and char (10.17–21.29 %). However, the release of chlorine was inhibited due to the melting behavior of MPW at <350 °C. Besides, the relative contents and types of organic chlorinated compounds in liquid products were both decreased with temperature. It was observed that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the greatest contributor to the formation of organic chlorinated compounds during MPW pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the pyrolysis of PET was significantly promoted by the HCl released from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Subsequently, the pathways for the formation of organic chlorinated compounds through the co-pyrolysis of PVC and PET were proposed, including the initial degradation and subsequent chlorination of PET.

These diffuse sources of pollution must be processed in an appropriate way, once they are collected. Among such processes, pyrolysis or combustion are to be explored. In the present study, five different masks were characterized before being submitted to pyrolysis and combustion experiments performed in a thermobalance under temperature ramps of 5, 10, 15, or 20 °C/min. Kinetic modeling of these pyrolysis or combustion processes was performed using the EIPR model because each mask contains different layers or components. The optimal values of the kinetic parameters were compared for the five masks and compared with that of their components.

Abstract: Red mud samples were used to catalyse in-situ co-pyrolysis of pinewood and low-density polyethylene for the production of high-quality bio-oil. The sodium cation in the crude red-mud was exchanged with barium and calcium cations and further tested to explore their role in oil upgrading. The relationship between red-mud catalytic activity and its constituents was explored using synthetic sodalite. The red-mud catalysts exhibited a considerable aromatisation capacity compared to the thermal co-pyrolysis, as the selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 12.7 to 19.6%, respectively. Long-chain molecules cracking was more significant in synthetic sodalite associated with their acidic active sites. The addition of barium and calcium cations to the red-mud largely improved oxygen elimination as a result of the enhanced catalyst basicity. In contrast, the aromatisation ability of red-mud significantly impeded by the large cation size (Ba2+ and Ca2+) due to the limited diffusion of pyrolysis vapours to the active sites. Ba-exchanged red-mud catalysts reduced the content of carboxylic acids in the bio-oil to 1.8 % while maintained a high yield of the organic fraction (34 %). Ca-exchanged red-mud catalysts produced the lowest fraction of oxygenated compounds (35.1 %); however, the organic phase yield was as low as 23.6 %.

Abstract: The formation of chloride products in the process for pyrolysis of municipal solid wastes (MSW) with key model components was investigated by Py-GC/MS method. HCl and CH3Cl are identified as the most abundant chloride products for the individual pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or corn straw (CS) in the range of 200–600 °C. For the pyrolysis of CS, a higher temperature is more favorable for the generation of HCl than that of CH3Cl. In the PVC pyrolytic products, chlorobenzene (Ph-Cl), benzyl chloride (Ph-CH2Cl), and 1-(chloroethyl)benzene (Ph-CHClCH3) are also detected but in extremely low amounts. For the co-pyrolysis of PVC/CS, the formation of CH3Cl is significantly promoted. The synergistic effect in the PVC/CS co-pyrolysis process is mainly attributed to the reaction between the HCl derived from PVC and the decomposition products of lignin. The products of Ph-Cl and Ph-CH2Cl are mainly generated from the cyclization of Cl-containing chain species. CH3Cl and Ph-CHClCH3 are mainly generated from secondary reactions between HCl and other pyrolytic products.

Abstract: Difficulty in separating natural and synthetic fibers in blended textiles challenges the resourcing of waste textiles. Pyrolysis is an essential process for energy conversion of waste, but the mechanism of co-pyrolysis from blended textiles to syngas production is not clear. For this, the impact of synergistic effects on product distribution in the co-pyrolysis of cellulose (CE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from waste textiles was investigated. The composition and distribution of the gaseous products with different ratios of CE/PET blends were focused on, and the optimized blending ratios were determined in association with thermogravimetric analyses. Then, the contribution of catalytic co-pyrolysis to the fuel gas (a summary of H2, CH4, and CO) production was tested. Bio-calcium-based MgO-CaO from oyster shells was used as a catalyst for the co-pyrolysis of CE/PET blends. The enhancement of fuel gas production by synergistic effect during the co-pyrolysis of cellulose and polyethylene terephthalate was revealed. The CE/PET blends with a mass ratio of 3.5:6.5 exhibited the highest fuel gas yield due to the strongest synergistic effect during the co-pyrolysis process. The distribution of small molecular gases has been enhanced due to the impact of synergistic effects, leading to a notable increase in CO yield.

Abstract: This study explores the use of waste plastic oil (WPO) as a potential substitute for gasoline in gasoline direct injection (GDi) spark-ignition (SI) engines. WPO was blended with gasoline in various ratios to assess its feasibility for reducing crude oil dependency and addressing global plastic waste management challenges. The WPO was extracted using a thermal-catalytic pyrolysis process in a batch reactor, utilizing a novel catalyst and discarded plastic chairs (comprising polycarbonate and high/low-density polyethylene) sourced from the university. The chemical and physical properties of the WPO were analyzed and compared with gasoline to evaluate its compatibility as a blend component, supported by GC–MS and FTIR analyses. Experimental tests were conducted on a GDi-based SI engine with WPO/gasoline blends at different engine speeds (2000, 2500, and 3000 rpm) and load conditions (low, partial, and high). Key parameters such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), and Cylinder Pressure (CP) were measured, with fixed spark timing at 18° bTDC and injection pressure at 180 bars. The experimental design employed the Taguchi method (L18 orthogonal array) with input variables including WPO/gasoline blend ratio, engine load, and engine speed, aiming to optimize output responses such as BTE, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke, and carbon monoxide (CO).

Abstract: The valorization of the plastic part from waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) is of significant importance for the upcycling of this waste stream with pyrolysis proposed as an appropriate, environmentally friendly, thermo-chemical recycling technique. The subject of this study is to investigate the distribution of the products obtained after the addition of certain catalysts in the pyrolysis of polymer blends with a composition similar to that of plastics in WEEE. Specifically, blends of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene (PP) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were examined in experiments taking place in a lab scale pyrolyser coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) for the on-line recording of the products obtained. Six different catalysts (CaO, γ-Al2O3, Fe2O3, ZSM-5, Silicalite, Al-MCM41) were used and the optimum pyrolysis temperatures were selected for each system based on evolved gas analysis. The results from catalytic cracking were compared and evaluated in terms of the number of compounds produced, the ratio between aromatic and aliphatic products, and the intensity of the peaks. It was found that the best choice for the decomposition of ABS is Fe2O3 and for HIPS the Al-MCM41. γ-Al2O3 affects PC degradation and CaO exhibits specific selectivity to this polymer. Pyrolysis of blends results in the production of a mixture of hydrocarbons together with other aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Polymer blends including chlorinated compounds such as PVC start degrading at relatively low temperatures, slightly over 200 °C. Degradation occurs in two steps with peaks around 300 and 465 °C, respectively. The first is attributed to the removal of halogenated compounds and the second to the scission of the main carbon chain. PVC degradation produces chlorine radicals that affect the degradation mechanism. The presence of the catalysts did not significantly change the temperatures of degradation. However, they do change the type of the products obtained. Pyrolysis of the styrenic polymers, i.e. ABS or HIPS resulted in mainly aromatic compounds with one, two or even three aromatic rings, whereas PC results in several phenols.

Abstract: Thermochemical conversion of plastic wastes is a promising approach to produce alternative energy-based fuels. Herein, we conducted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of polycarbonate (PC) and polystyrene (PS) to generate aromatic hydrocarbons using HZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil-5, hydrogen, Aluminosilicate) as a catalyst. The results indicated that employing HZSM-5 in the catalytic conversion of PC facilitated the synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons in comparison to the non-catalytic run. A competitive reaction between aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic oxygenates was observed within the studied temperature region, and catalytic degradation temperature of 700 °C maximized the competing reaction towards the formation of targeted aromatic hydrocarbons at the expense of phenolic products. Catalyst type also played a vital role in the catalytic decomposition of PC wastes, and HZSM-5 with different Si/Al molar ratios produced more aromatic hydrocarbons than HY (Zeolite Y, hydrogen, Faujasite). Regarding the effect of Si/Al molar ration in HZSM-5 on the distribution of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), a Si/Al molar ratio of 38 maximized benzene formation with an advanced factor of 5.1. Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of PC with hydrogen-rich plastic wastes including polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polystyrene (PS) favored the production of MAHs, and PS was the most effective hydrogen donor with a ∼2.5-fold increase.

Abstract: Energy shortages and rapid increase in its demand are amongst the major problems facing the world today. In response to the rapid depletion of fossils fuels, other alternative energy sources have been explored. One of the methods of generating energy is converting plastics into usable fuel. Two major problems facing the world today prompting to pyrolysis are disposal of plastic waste due to their non -biodegradable nature and depletion of fossil fuels as a result of the continuously rising demand. The feedstock for the pyrolysis plant was selected to be Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) in the form of flakes ranging from 8 – 12 mm and were supplied by PETRECO. The binary dominance matrix was used to examine the optimal heat exchanger. The helical heat exchanger was designed to reduce cost by elimination of a water pump as the heat transfer fluid lost heat to the atmosphere. It was easier to obtain liquid paraffin from the chosen raw materials since it was already in the paraffin chemical structure. In the pyrolysis plant, the temperature in the reactor increased at a maximum rate of 6˚C/min regulated by a temperature controller and each batch took 60 minutes. The percentage weight of paraffin yield was a maximum of 40% weight of the feedstock. Therefore, 1 kg of plastic waste was converted to 286 ml of paraffin fuel. The presence of oxygen in the PET structure enhanced the solid residue of the product. The properties of the solid residue left in the reactor were sufficient to recommend for PET bricks. The solid residue had a maximum compressive strength of 10 N/mm2 which was within the standard range and had less water absorbing tendencies and hence a longer lifespan.

Abstract: In this work, acid-washing corn stover (ACS) impregnated with various concentrations of potassium was co-pyrolyzed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fixed bed reactor. The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 zeolite on product yields and mono-aromatic selectivity was studied. As the concentration of potassium increased, a reduction in liquid and an increase in gas and char yields were observed in both catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis. Potassium enhanced alkenes production with a maximum value of 54.2 % obtained from 0.8 wt%K-ACS/HDPE, indicating that potassium dispersed in char exerted catalytic effect on promoting the degradation of HDPE. Compared to ACS/HDPE, the catalytic co-pyrolysis of K-ACS/HDPE over HZSM-5 produced higher yield of mono-aromatics in the range of 77.3–82.5 % due to the fact that potassium optimized the co-pyrolysis intermediates diffused into HZSM-5 zeolite. The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 also favored the selectivity of toluene and xylene while suppressed the selectivity of alkylnaphthalene.

Abstract: Polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis is an essential process for converting plastic waste into valuable products, but the interplay between chemical kinetics and physical phenomena, such as bubble formation, heat transfer, and devolatilization, remains a challenge for reactor-scale design. While the influence of transport limitations under fast heating is recognized, their quantitative integration into predictive models is still lacking. This study investigates PE pyrolysis using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Pyroprobe experiments over a wide range of heating rates (5 °C/min to 20,000 °C/s). TGA results show that heat transfer resistance delays degradation onset, with apparent activation energies ranging from 338 to 385 kJ/mol (non-isothermal) and 65–155 kJ/mol (isothermal). Pyroprobe data reveal diffusion-controlled behavior, bubble entrapment, and incomplete devolatilization. To evaluate the timing between melting and pyrolysis, we introduce the dimensionless “H number,” which compares melting time to reaction time and identifies whether pyrolysis begins before the polymer is fully molten. Together with the Biot and internal pyrolysis numbers, it helps distinguish kinetic from transport-limited regimes and predict the onset of physical constraints.

Abstract: As the world's ability to cope with the fast-rising output of disposable plastic products is limited, plastic pollution has emerged as one of the most important environmental challenges. Catalytic solvothermal conversion (SolvX) could potentially utilize mixed waste plastics (MWPs) for sustainable fuels and chemical production. In this study, the effect of SolvX reaction time (1 – 5 h), Pd/C catalyst loading (0 – 10 wt%), and hydrogen loading (0–75 bar) on MWPs were investigated using supercritical toluene as solvent at temperature 350 °C. Four major waste plastics including low-density polyethylene (#4), polypropylene (#5), polystyrene (#6), and polyurethane (#7) were used as feedstock for this study. Along with SolvX conversion, the liquid products (crude oils) were characterized for elemental composition changes using ultimate analysis, boiling point distribution via thermogravimetric analysis, functional groups alteration using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and product identification via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the addition of catalyst and hydrogen have positive effects on the SolvX conversion. According to the elemental analysis, the SolvX crude oils' higher heating values (HHV) range from 32 to 38 MJ/Kg. The range of boiling points demonstrates that Pd/C increases the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. Additionally, a proposed catalytic SolvX reaction mechanism shows that the aromaticity raised with the increment of residence time and Pd/C enhances hydrodenitrogenation and deoxygenation at higher hydrogen loading.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics with supercritical toluene and Pd/C catalyst, focusing on hydrogenation and deoxygenation mechanisms rather than pure plastic oil fingerprints.",CO_PYROLYSIS;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;TARGET_HYDROGEN

Abstract: Low-density polyethylene and polypropylene were thermally decomposed individually in a batch reactor at temperatures up to 450°C as a recycling route from the aspect of the production of petrochemical feedstock. More detailed separation of polyalkenes splitting compounds was achieved using high resolution GC (efficiencies up to 490,000 plates) than before. The GC–MS as well as the dependence of homomorphy factors and isopropyl group increments on the number of carbon atoms of alk-1-enes, alk-2-enes, alka-α,ω-dienes and alkanes were used for identification of separated analytes. Thermal cracking of LDPE products in the range C5–C23 were characterized by quintets of peaks in the chromatogram which were assigned to n-alkanes, alk-1-enes, (E)-alk-2-enes, (Z)-alk-2-enes and alka-α,ω-dienes with average quantitative ratio 1:1.2:0.07:0.05:0.08. In fraction up to n-C8 140 GC peaks were separated and identified, including around 30 acyclic octenes. In contrast to the polyethylene thermal cracking which yields products with straight-chain hydrocarbon structure, polypropylene cracking is characterized by the formation of compounds with branched and high prevailingly unsaturated hydrocarbon structure.

Abstract: The deactivation mechanism of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO) was investigated. The accelerated deactivation experiment of catalyst was performed with model oil containing different impurities, and results indicated that the deactivation of catalyst was related to chlorides, nitrides, and sulfides in WPPO. By changing the concentration of chloride, the interactions between the three impurities were studied. Combined with the characterization results of fresh and spent catalysts, chloride was the direct cause of the deactivation of the catalyst. Chlorine atoms in chlorides were converted into HCl gas in hydrotreating, which reacted with Ni active sites, resulting in the sintering of the average Ni particle size from 52.62 nm to 139.63 nm, and the loss of Ni active components by 3–8 wt%, especially inhibiting the hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalyst. In addition, HCl reacted with NH3 (byproduct of nitride hydrogenation) to generate NH4Cl. The high concentration of HCl in the reaction system increased the crystallization temperature of NH4Cl from 210 °C to 294 °C, which led to the crystallization of ammonium salts in the catalyst bed. NH4Cl crystals adsorbed on the catalyst surface, resulting in a decrease in specific surface area and pore volume, and an increase in the average pore diameter of the catalyst, which was the main reason for the rapid deactivation of the catalyst.

Abstract: The present study focuses on the recovery of superior-quality pyrolytic oil (PO) from the pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (WPP). The optimum heating rate, temperature and catalyst dosing were identified from experimental pyrolysis runs in a batch pyrolyzer. The thermal pyrolysis at 550 0C at 20 0C/min produced 83.5% PO, the maximum yield. The activated zeolite and kaolin catalyst prepared from the low-cost natural zeolite and kaolin clay were used for catalytic pyrolysis. The specific surface areas were determined to be 16.45 and 13.62 m2/g, with pore sizes 18.5 and 20.6 nm for zeolite and kaolin, respectively. The catalytic dosing of 12% zeolite and 10% kaolin was found to be the most optimum towards maximum PO yield. The FTIR and GC-MS analysis provided the qualitative and quantitative identification of various hydrocarbons (HCs) in PO.

Abstract: Plastic valorization has received particular attention as an environmentally benign approach to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, contaminated plastic and biomass waste mixtures suffer from single-stream recycling. Waste mixtures are currently discarded through landfilling and incineration. As a sustainable disposal and valorization method for converting plastic and biomass waste mixtures into energy-intensive products, especially syngas (H2 and CO), this study utilizes catalytic pyrolysis and a CO2 flow gas. A plastic container contaminated with a food waste mixture (PFW) was used as the model waste. The major products of the pyrolysis of PFW were liquid hydrocarbons (HC) (C7–30) and wax-like HCs with negligible formation of oxygen-containing HCs. However, the high production of wax-like HCs becomes a problem. Catalytic pyrolysis was employed to convert HCs into simpler product streams such as syngas. Although syngas formation tripled with the Ni catalyst, catalyst deactivation was observed. To suppress catalyst deactivation and promote CO formation, CO2 was introduced instead of N2. During the CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, the syngas yield from PFW increased to 95.5 % because the chemical reactions between CO2 and liquid/wax-like HCs produced additional H2 and CO. The catalytic reaction with CO2 suppressed carbon deposition because long-chain HCs were converted to CO rather than coke.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on syngas production from co-pyrolysis of contaminated plastic and food waste, with oil as a minor intermediate and no detailed oil composition reported.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The disposal of waste tires (WT) presents significant environmental challenges, and microwave fluidized-bed pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution, though research remains limited.

Co-pyrolysis between WT and two types of biomass (peanut shell (PS), Ascophyllum (AS)) was investigated, using a microwave fluidized-bed reactor, focusing on the in-situ sulfur fixation mechanism. The results show that co-pyrolysis led to higher char yield and lower gas yield than expected, with less sulfur released into the pyrolysis oil and more sulfur retained in the char. The interaction between the products of WT and biomass promoted the formation of macromolecular organic compounds, leading to an increase in aromatic hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil and inhibiting the release of sulfur-containing organic compounds. Sulfur in WT was oxidized by -OH radicals from biomass, forming solid oxygenated organic sulfur and reducing the catalytic decomposition of sulfur. Additionally, the retention of alkaline metals in biomass ash enhanced sulfur fixation. These findings suggest that microwave fluidized-bed co-pyrolysis of WT and biomass is effective in capturing sulfur and generating valuable hydrocarbons, providing a promising solution for managing urban and agricultural solid wastes sustainably.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass, no pure plastic/waste tire oil composition data reported and no focus on oil fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The performance of both fluidized and spouted bed reactors in the pyrolysis of waste plastics is conditioned by particle agglomeration phenomena, which worsens the quality of the gas–solid contact and eventually lead to defluidization. The objective of this work is to determine the optimum conditions for stable operation (without defluidization) in a bench scale plant fitted with a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor and equipped with a nonporous draft tube, which operates in continuous mode. The insertion of these devices enhances the gas–solid contact, especially in the fountain region, and leads to a highly stable hydrodynamic regime, with these features being of especial relevance for the in situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics. This paper deals with the effect different variables have on the minimum temperature for stable operation by avoiding defluidization. The variables analyzed are as follows: plastic type (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET and PMMA), plastic feed rate, mass of inert material in the bed, spouting velocity and use of catalyst. The results show that polymers whose chains decompose at low temperatures or have high degrees of branching require low operating temperatures. Besides, as the ratio of bed mass to plastic feed rate (Wbed/Qplastic) and/or spouting velocity were increased, the temperature required to avoid defluidization was also reduced.

Abstract: The catalytic upcycling of polyethylene (PE) remains a major challenge in sustainable waste management. This study demonstrates that water promotes PE hydrocracking over Ru/zeolite catalysts only when the support framework is strongly hydrophilic, as in HY and HMOR. Systematic characterization reveals that this promotional effect is governed by surface wettability, rather than acidity or metal dispersion. Thermodynamic analysis confirms that water and PE are immiscible under reaction conditions, ruling out direct water–polymer interactions. Instead, water preferentially associates with hydrophilic catalyst surfaces, promoting Brønsted acid activity through confined hydration. Controlled experiments show that direct contact between water and the catalyst is essential for enhanced reactivity; spatial separation between the two leads to suppressed conversion, likely due to unfavorable interactions between water and the molten polymer. These findings highlight the mechanistic role of interfacial water–catalyst accessibility and establish catalyst hydrophilicity as a key design parameter for reliable and efficient water-assisted hydrocracking.

Abstract: Aiming at controlling the selective depolymerization via the thermal route, we investigated a two-stage process, where volatiles are produced in a low temperature (800°C, residence time <1.3s). Splitting the process allows to control the reaction times independently and circumvent limitations of a multiphase reacting system, where melting contrasts a rapid heating. The two-stage process with independent melting can dramatically improve the olefins yield, and particularly that of ethene. A proper heating policy in the 1st thermal decomposition affects the species distribution in the intermediate product (oils and waxes). The following gas phase, short contact time thermal cracking takes advantage of a ‘tailored’ feedstock, to drive the products distribution towards a larger amount of ethene.

Abstract: This study investigated the pyrolysis of automotive plastic wastes (APW) for the production of diesel-grade oil products using a modified calcium bentonite clay catalyst. The research aimed to optimize the process for maximum oil yield and diesel range organics yield. The APW was characterized by its chemical composition and physical properties and the optimal temperature and catalyst amount were determined for maximum oil yield and diesel range hydrocarbons. The results showed that the APW contained mixed Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), High/Low Density Polyethylene (H/LDPE), Polypropylene (PP), Polystrene (PS) and fiberglass, with a large quantity of volatiles and ash. The average oil yield was higher in the catalytic process compared to that in the thermal process. Generally, higher temperature above 450 °C produced waxy oil, thus lower temperature favoured more Diesel Range Organics (DRO). Both processes yield similar yields of C8–C24 DRO, and in both cases, lower temperature favoured high yield of C8-C24 hydrocarbons. The catalyst significantly increased the yield of oil, but did not significantly increase C8–C24 DRO yield. The optimal conditions for a maximum oil yield of 78.6 % and DRO yield of 79.5 % was a temperature of 416 °C and 24.3 wt% clay. Thus, the modified calcium bentonite clay can be used to improve oil yield from pyrolysis of APW. The oil produced had properties such as calorific value (49.85 MJ/kg), flash point (113 °C ) and total aromatics 3.55 area%, similar to those of commercial diesel, and comprised mostly of 2,4-Dimethyl-1-heptene (25.37 ± 2.01 %) of thermal and 2, 4 – Dimethyl – 1 – heptane (23.44 ± 2.42) in the catalytic process.

Abstract: Polycarbonate (PC) is an engineering thermoplastic that is widely used in electrical and electronic equipment. This plastic often contains tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), the most common brominated flame retardant. Thermal degradation of the PC-TBBA leads to generation of numerous bromo-organic products in the pyrolytic oil, hindering its appropriate utilization, as well as corrosive hydrogen bromide gas. The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate and compare the pyrolysis products of PC-TBBA and PC-TBBA + Cu2O at various temperatures, with an emphasis on the yield and distribution of brominated compounds. In pyrolysis of PC-TBBA + Cu2O, at the maximum degradation temperature (600 °C), as much as 86% of total Br was trapped in the residue, while 3% and 11% were distributed in the condensate and gas fractions, respectively. In contrast, the distribution of Br from non-catalytic pyrolysis of PC-TBBA (600 °C) was 0.5% residue, 40% condensate, and 60% gas. The results of this study revealed that in the presence of Cu2O, organo-bromine products were most likely involved in Ullman-type coupling reactions, leading to early cross-linking of the polymer network that efficiently hinders their vaporization.

A two-stage catalytic pyrolysis process was employed to convert common plastic wastes— high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate—into graphitic nanomaterials and hydrogen-rich gases. To enhance efficiency, bimetallic catalysts (Fe–Ni, Co–Fe, Co–Ni) supported on MgO were synthesized using impregnation and coprecipitation methods. Among these, Fe–Ni–Mg prepared via coprecipitation exhibited the highest catalytic activity, yielding carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen.

Abstract: Medical waste, posing pathogen and toxin risks, endangers the environment and public health. Staged pyrolysis, segmenting pyrolysis with distinct conditions to release components stepwise, offers a viable solution for its safe disposal and the synergistic production of clean fuels and high-value chemicals. However, a limited understanding of how pyrolysis parameters influence chlorine removal and product formation hampers the practical implementation of medical waste thermochemical conversion. Based on response surface methodology, the impacts of key conditions during the low-temperature dechlorination stage (Stage I) on product yields and chlorine migration pathway were firstly analyzed. The optimal conditions for dechlorinated semi-char production were 309.5 °C, 8.5 °C/min, and 39.2 min, under which 83.2 % of chlorine underwent dechlorination and migrated to the gas phase in the form of HCl, enabling its removal via water washing. HCl released from infusion tubes catalyzed the dehydration of medical gauze, while the hydroxyl groups of medical gauze promoted the dehydrochlorination of PVC. In the dechlorinated semi-char re-pyrolysis stage (Stage II), for chlorine migration, high heating rates favored HCl (HCl reacted with NH3 to form NH4Cl, which dissolved in oil.), while low rates increased CH3Cl (Over 99 % of total chlorine-containing gas.).

Abstract: Different chemical modifications were performed to the natural aluminosilicate Montanit300® in order to improve its catalytic activity in PE depolymerization.

Abstract: Printed circuit boards (PCB) are one of the most challenging fractions of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in terms of recycling due to their complexity and diversity. Pyrolysis seems to be a promising alternative for production of energy carriers from its organic fraction with simultaneous recovery of metals. Reaction atmosphere is among the process parameters that affects the thermal decomposition as well as the products’ formation and distribution. In this study, the decomposition of two different PCB fractions in inert and steam atmospheres has been investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and lab scale fixed bed reactor experiments. It was found that the decomposition of the tested materials in steam atmosphere starts at lower temperatures and proceeds slower compared to the N2 atmosphere. Moreover, a two-step decomposition has been observed on the PCB sockets fraction due to the fact that high amount of antimony oxide was present, a common additive for improving the flame retardancy, which have been also observed on previous studies (Wu et al., 2014). The presence of steam influence the pyrolysis gas composition and promotes additional vaporisation of antimony as verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Abstract: Pyrolysis of waste plastics to recycle valuable hydrocarbons represents an attractive technology for reducing waste and providing feedstocks for petrochemical products and fuels. Via the simultaneous processing of heavy petroleum residue fractions, synergies can be harnessed by converting bottom-of-the-barrel refining products into lighter fractions with higher value while improving processability of plastic waste materials. To investigate the effect of reactor pressure, a continuous laboratory co-pyrolysis plant was operated. The setup consisted of two consecutive tubular zones to convert a mixture of LDPE and a heavy petroleum residue to a final temperature of 450 °C at different pressures between 2 and 10 bar. The products were evaluated regarding obtained mass yields and their boiling range. Gaseous and liquid products increased with enhanced pressure, resulting in nearly tripled gas and light liquid formation, whereas more unconverted feed was consumed. Because the reactor pressure also affects the residence time by suppressing evaporation, which subsequently varies between 360 and 440 s, further investigations considering the dependence of product yields on the residence time over a range of 280 to 480 s were necessary. The comparison resulted in the conclusion that the enhancing effect of increased reactor pressure is not only caused by a retention time elongation in the hot reactor zone. Other physical effects also play a role, such as promoted heat transmission and a direct intervention of reactor pressure with the chemical reactions. In the tested range, an enhancing effect of higher reactor pressures on the cracking of the reaction mixture was observed.

Abstract: Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is a representative copolymer widely adopted across various sectors owing to its superior physiochemical properties; however, an environmentally benign protocol for the disposal of EVA waste has not yet been established owing to the various ratios of acetate to polyethylene. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an innovative thermochemical technique for converting EVA waste into energy resources, specifically syngas. CO2 was used to enhance the environmental sustainability of pyrolysis. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that most of the EVA (approximately 99 wt%) was converted into pyrolytic oil and gases. However, the mechanistic features of CO2 in the pyrolysis of EVA could not be fully elucidated through single- or double-stage pyrolysis owing to the slow kinetics of the homogeneous reaction between CO2 and volatiles. To expedite the reaction kinetics, we used a cobalt (Co)-based catalyst (Co/SiO2). In the presence of Co/SiO2, the concentration of CO produced under CO2 was approximately 30-fold higher than that under N2. Furthermore, the homogeneous reactions resulted in fewer benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the pyrolytic oil under CO2 conditions.

The results showed that the activities of nickel catalysts decreased in the order of Ni/La > Ni/Sr > Ni/Mg, which strongly depended on the degree of metal–support interaction. The strong metal–support interaction in Ni/Mg catalyst was not favorable for the exsolution of large amount of metallic Ni, resulting in the lowest yield of CNTs.

The kinetic parameters for the GFRP were derived from the Freedman method with resultant activation energy ranging from 41.4kJ/mol to 78.4kJ/mol. The main components of the product gases were carbon monoxide from the ether and carbonyl decomposition of polymer and hydrogen from the aromatic ring breakage. The structural variations in the GFRP char were determined using BET, SEM, and FT-IR techniques. The surface area of GFRP char exhibited its maximum value at 600°C, decreasing at higher temperatures with the collapsing macro-pore structure. The decomposed portion of the polymers attached to the glass fiber increased when increasing the temperature from SEM image.

Abstract: This study explores the novel integration of ternary fuel blends comprising diesel, biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil, and pyrolysis oil obtained from waste plastics in a single-cylinder direct injection compression ignition (CI) engine. A major innovation lies in the simultaneous utilization of two waste-derived fuels—biodiesel and plastic pyrolysis oil—to create a sustainable, low-emission alternative to conventional diesel. Engine tests were conducted under varying injection pressures (170, 200, and 230 bar) and load conditions to evaluate brake thermal efficiency (BTE), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and key emissions such as NOx, CO, UHC, and smoke opacity. The results indicate that blends such as P10B220D70 and P15B215D70 offer optimal engine performance and combustion stability at 230 bar injection pressure. Notably, a Python-based statistical correlation analysis was employed to determine the influence of input variables (fuel blend, injection pressure, and load) on engine performance and emissions, identifying injection pressure as the most significant factor.

Abstract: The co-reaction synergy of wheat straw (WS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic waste with varying mass ratios were evaluated at 550 °C in a fixed bed pyrolyzer reactor. Ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of WS and HDPE feed mix (3:1) at a high feed to catalyst ratio (10:1) was performed over Mn, Ni, and Zn (1, 5, and 10 wt%) metal-modified HZSM-5 at 550 °C to study the effect of metal promotors variations on the production of aromatics and light olefins. The prepared catalysts were characterized by employing XRD, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and UV-Vis analytical techniques. The results obtained in the present work indicated that 1%-Zn modified HZSM-5 produced a more relative proportion of aromatics (25.12%) in the co-pyrolysis oil organic phase, followed by 5% Ni and 5%-Zn-loaded HZSM-5 at 16.22% and 15.76% respectively. Furthermore, 5% Ni-HZSM-5 has shown higher deoxygenation ability (58.43%) in reducing the oxygenates formed, followed by 5% Mn (40.96%) and 1% Zn (35.37%) respectively. While, 5% Mn-HZSM-5 generated pyrolytic gases with higher volumetric compositions of (C2-C4) light olefins at 15.84%, followed by 1% Mn (13.97%) and 10% Ni (13.61%) respectively and these volumetric yields were strongly correlated with intermediate acidity of catalysts.

Abstract: The aim of this work was the valorisation of rice crop wastes mixtures by pyrolysis to produce liquids to be used as bio-fuels or as raw bio-materials. The effect of waste mixtures composition on liquids yield and composition was studied. Rice husk (RH) and straw (RS) were pyrolysed with polyethylene (PE), the main plastic used in rice production process. Polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) were also studied, due to their presence in great amounts in solid wastes. The rise of rice husk amount in PE blends led to a decrease in the conversion of co-pyrolysis (pyrolysis of blends of biomass rice and plastic wastes) and to a reduction of liquid yields. Thus, the blend with 20% (w/w) of rice wastes was selected for further studies. No great changes were observed in the results when husk was replaced by straw, which is advantageous for the pyrolysis process. However, the same was not observed for the type of plastic waste. PS decreased total conversion and the formation of gases and liquids and increased aromatic compounds content in liquids. Some tests were done using hydrogen (hydropyrolysis) instead of nitrogen (pyrolysis) with the aim of improving liquids quality due to the presence of hydrogen in the reaction medium. Different pathways were analysed: (I) co-pyrolysis; (II) co-hydropyrolysis; (III) co-pyrolysis followed by hydropyrolysis and (IV) hydropyrolysis of co-pyrolysis liquids.

Abstract: The compositions of the pyrolysis products of pure low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) and their mixtures have been investigated over a temperature range from 300 to 500°C. The pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a closed batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere to study the effects of reaction temperature and residence time. LDPE was thermally degraded to oil at 425°C however, beyond this temperature the proportion of oil product decreased as a result of its conversion to char and hydrocarbon gas. Compositional analysis of the oil products showed that aliphatic hydrocarbons were the major components, but the proportion of aromatic compounds increased at higher temperatures and residence times. On the other hand, PS degraded at around 350°C, mainly into a viscous dark-coloured oil. The formation of char only increased marginally until 425°C, but was dramatically enhanced at 450 and 500°C, reaching up to 30wt.%. The oil product from PS even at 350°C consisted almost entirely of aromatic compounds especially toluene, ethylbenzene and styrene. Under increasing temperatures and residence times, the oil product from PS was preferentially converted to char, while gas formation was preferred for the oil from LDPE. For instance at 500°C, PS produced about twice the amount of char obtained from LDPE indicating the role of aromatic compounds in char formation via condensation of the aromatic ring structure. During the co-pyrolysis of a 7:3 mixture of LDPE and PS, wax product was observed at 350°C leading to oil at 400°C, indicating that the presence of PS influenced the conversion of LDPE by lowering its degradation temperature.

Abstract: The industrial recycling of spent electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries is severely overlooked due to low economic viability, leading to significant environmental pollution and resource waste. To simultaneously achieve green and high-value-added utilization, an advanced upcycling strategy is innovatively proposed. It involves the deep detoxification and selectively directional conversion to alkene of spent electrolyte through vacuum co-pyrolysis catalyzed by in-situ generated alkyl lithium-synergized ZSM-5. The feasibility of the detoxification and selective conversion of spent electrolyte has been first validated, followed by the optimization of temperature and pressure parameters. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the alkene yield in the pyrolysis gas can reache up to 81.16 % under the optimal conditions of 530 °C and an initial pressure of 100 Pa.

First-order mass loss rate constants obtained at 500 °C were circa 0.5 and 1.3 s−1 for HDPE and LDPE, respectively, which are significantly higher than the majority of the values reported in the literature.

Additionally, we have observed that the interplay between mass transfer and the depolymerization reactions can be used to steer the product distribution. For instance, in a 50 g scale batch reactor, the product obtained at 420 °C (only oil) is much lighter than at 500 °C (mixture of oil and wax), which can be attributed to the much lower evaporation rate of larger cracking products at 420 °C as a result of which these fragments crack further in the reacting liquid phase.",YES,NO,The study focuses on intrinsic kinetics and mass transfer effects rather than providing detailed oil composition or fingerprint data.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Plastics are widely used in daily life and industry. However, the natural degradation of waste plastics is very slow, causing considerable environmental problems. Catalytic cracking is able to convert waste plastics into fuels and chemicals, being an efficient and sustainable utilization route for waste plastics. Zeolites are commonly used as catalysts for this process, with the performance mainly affected by diffusion and acidity properties. It is necessary to elucidate the combinatorial effect of these two factors. Herein, zeolite Beta was used as the model catalyst for the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The synergistic effect of diffusion and acidity on the catalytic performance was explored by systematically controlling the Si/Al ratio (SAR) and particle size of zeolite Beta. By correlating the acidity and pore structure of Beta zeolites with the catalytic performance, a gasoline yield descriptor − gasoline factor (GF) was proposed, and GF fitted well with the gasoline yields of LDPE cracking by Beta zeolites, demonstrating that GF may provide theoretical guidance for the optimized design of zeolite catalysts in the LDPE cracking. Through fine analysis of the gasoline composition with M4 multi-dimensional chromatography, for the first time, a high proportion of cyclo-olefins was discovered in the gasoline products of all zeolite catalysts, which was ascribed to the unique long hydrocarbon chains of LDPE.

Abstract: Fast co-pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution for upcycling polymer waste, including scrap tyre and plastics.

This research explored fast co-pyrolysis of scrap tyre with polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polystyrene (PS) to understand synergistic effects and sulphur transformation mechanisms. A pronounced synergy was observed between scrap tyre and plastics, with the nature of the synergy being plastic-type dependent.

Abstract: A global goal is to call for common solutions to the challenge of environmental conservation. The cheap, clean and green energy and processes help to beat the hazardous pollution of plastics. An action of the STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process) on the polymer is to create a novel vision of the depolymerization of plastics to generate valuable fuels plus abundant hydrogen. In this paper, a solar thermo-coupled electrochemical system was first designed and employed to realize the plastics depolymerization to useful fuels for enhanced the solar utilization and the chemical polymer conversion. Exemplified by polypropylene (PP), the plastics were efficiently converted to light fuel and hydrogen via the solar-driven electrolysis coupled with pyrolysis. The results demonstrated that the depolymerization temperature was greatly lowered compared to conventional pyrolysis. The STEP conversion rates increased with a lift of the temperature and current. The high total conversion rate was significantly achieved by reaching 68.48% at 350 °C, including the solid phase of 31.52%, the liquid phase of 7.85% and the gas phase of 60.63% (w/w), which was compared to the 28.39% of the sole pyrolysis. The hydrogen was evolved during the process in the final volume of 72.5 ml, which was about 9.3 times more than that of the pyrolysis at 400 °C. In the outdoor experiments, the total conversion reached 66.64% at 350 °C, which was compared to 26.37% of the pyrolysis only. The light hydrocarbons were richly produced in the distribution of C1–C5 hydrocarbons while only tiny amounts of methane and ethane were probed in the pyrolysis.

Abstract: Municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal through landfill and incineration represents a costly and hazardous challenge to global health, and loss of underutilised resource for the circular economy. Thermal pyrolysis of the organic components of MSW offers a scalable route to liquid fuels, but process optimisation requires deep insight into the associated thermochemistry and kinetics. Here we apply thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and kinetic modelling to the (catalytic) pyrolysis of a model MSW feedstock comprising cellulose, sucrose, sugarcane bagasse and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, with or without Al-SBA-15, MM-Al-SBA-15 or HZSM-5 catalysts, occurs in three main stages, namely the melting and concomitant evaporation of volatiles, and subsequent decomposition of carbohydrate, then LDPE and finally lignin components. The rate of non-catalytic MSW pyrolysis increased with sample heating rates (from 20 to 120 °C /min) but had little impact on the temperature or mass loss during each stage. Catalytic pyrolysis is sensitive to the catalyst:feedstock mass ratio; increasing this ratio from 1 to 5 increased mass losses during the removal of volatiles and three subsequent decomposition stages, while lowering the temperature of LDPE decomposition. Kinetic analysis by Friedman’s isoconversional method reveals a monotonic increase in activation energy for each stage of (non-catalytic and catalytic) MSW pyrolysis. However, energy barriers for individual stages decreased with increasing catalyst:feedstock ratio and were sensitive to the catalyst type: Al-SBA-15 offers the largest decrease in barriers for carbohydrate (−86 kJ/mol) and LDPE decomposition (−92 kJ/mol), and similar promotion to HZSM-5 for lignin decomposition (∼100 kJ/mol), at the highest catalyst content.

Abstract: In Bangladesh, approximately 24,000 tonnes of general wastes are produced per day which creates environmental pollution due to lack of their proper disposal. Hence, a unique utilization of three types of wastes named rice husk (RH), scrap tire (ST) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using a fixed bed co-pyrolysis reactor for bio-oil extraction. Pyrolysis is selected because it produces more liquid (bio-oil) than other thermochemical treatments. The extracted bio-oil has been characterized by elemental analysis, calorific value, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography (GC-MS). During co-pyrolysis it is observed that higher process temperature produces more gaseous product and comparatively less char and liquid products (above 400 °C). In terms of a mixing ratio, higher percentage of LDPE produces more liquid and gaseous products on the contrary less amount of char product. The optimum operating conditions to produce maximum amount of bio-oil were 400 °C temperature for particle size of 1.18–2.36 mm, feed mixing ratio of 40:40:20 (ST/RH/LDPE), and running time of 120 min. The elemental analysis of the extracted bio-oil showed higher carbon and hydrogen content and lower oxygen content with a higher calorific value than that of the studied individual biomass-derived oil, leading to upgraded bio-oil. FTIR and GC-MS analysis clarifies the presence of mainly aliphatic compound in the co-pyrolytic oil.

Abstract: The conversion of plastic waste to high value-added aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) through catalytic pyrolysis offers huge untapped opportunities for resource recovery and plastic pollution control. Economical equipment configuration, operation and maintenance, high safety factor, high efficiency, stability, low-cost catalyst synthesis design, high yield, high selectivity of products are the key to the practical application of catalytic pyrolysis. In present study, low-cost kieselguhr based ZSM-5 was synthesized by one-pot in situ hydrothermal method using kieselguhr as silicon-aluminum source. During the depolymerization-recrystallization process, the selective growth and self-assembly of crystals on the a, c axis formed large-grain of ZSM-5 with extended straight channels and maximized sinusoidal channels. Native transition and alkaline-earth metals were coordinated to the acidic sites of the silica-aluminum skeleton, achieving tunability of the catalyst acidity. Catalytic pyrolysis of mask waste at 550 °C in a fixed bed reactor achieved the highest pyrolysis oil yield (44.3 wt%) and BTEX selectivity (77.1 %) with p-xylene as the dominant xylene product (78.2 %). After 3 cycles of long-life experiments, the BTEX selectivity of the catalyst remained at 65.1 %, which is higher than that of commercial ZSM-5 (54.9 %), indicating the superior use stability. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the excellent shape-selectivity of the catalyst is based on its unique pore structure, which facilitates the diffusion and transport of appropriately sized intermediates/products within the structure, resulting in products with advantageous distributions.

Abstract: Yogurt plastic containers made of polystyrene (PS), olive stone, and mixtures of both have been converted into activated carbon materials transforming them firstly into char via pyrolysis and secondly with activation using either KOH or H2SO4. The pyrolysis of the olive stone gave a higher yield of material than the plastic PS. However, the activation of the PS char with KOH was more effective, reaching surface areas of 508 vs 194 m2 g−1 of the corresponding prepared with olive stone. The prepared materials were tested as CO2 adsorbent in thermobalance and fixed-be column assays. The materials activated with H2SO4 slightly enhanced the adsorption ability of the original char but were far from the performance obtained with KOH activation. The CO2 isotherms showed high synergy of CO2 uptake and selectivity when using activated chars prepared with the char from the mixture of raw materials, specially at a 1:1 mass ratio. The isosteric heat of adsorption values were those expected for a physisorption process. Further experiments in a fixed-bed column were also studied at atmospheric pressure at different inlet CO2 concentrations (10–50%). The CO2 retention increased as the partial CO2 pressure rose.

Abstract: This work systematically assessed the effects of pyrolysis parameters, such as sample weight, particle size, carrier gas flow rate, and temperature, on product speciation and distribution in the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) for intrinsic kinetics. This study employed a Box-Behnken design (BBD), along with the analysis of BBD boundary conditions, as well as conditions beyond the BBD to validate the pyrolysis conditions in the primary decomposition of PP using a micropyrolyzer coupled to two-dimensional chromatography with flame ionization and time-of-flight spectrometer detectors (Py–GC × GC–FID/TOF–MS). Statistical differences and similarities in the product distribution of the experiments were determined using principal component analysis (PCA). Characteristic time analysis indicated that the sample weights employed in the study were within the isothermal kinetically controlled region, with film thickness ranging from 4.85 to 14.46 µm. The analysis of 600 pyrolysis products identified and quantified in the pyrolysis of PP for the condition combinations evaluated in BBD resulted in statistical differences at temperatures of 460, 530, and 600 oC, with C3 to C35 yields ranging from 39.88 ± 2.08 to 66.61 ± 3.26 wt%.

Abstract: The need for sustainable fuel sources and efficient waste management has led researchers to explore innovative methods for converting waste into fuel.

This method involves hydrolysing WTPO with the metallic catalyst, assessing the physical-chemical properties, formulation efficiency compared to petroleum products, and diesel engine performance like the impact on fuel consumption, combustion, and emissions. The synthetic HWTPO's chemical and physical properties were found to be comparable to European diesel specifications (European standard 590). Under hydroprocessing conditions (80 bar and 375 °C), the Co/SBA-15 catalyst produced isoalkanes, n-alkanes, and aromatics in quantities nearly equivalent to 100 % diesel.

Abstract: Wheat cultivation represents about 42 % of the total cereal cultivation area in the Baltic Sea region, generating huge amounts of wheat straw (WS) that needs to be optimally managed. In this context, this research aims to investigate the extent of using pyrolysis process in WS valorization. The experiments were performed using a thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer on WS and its mixtures with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags at different mixing ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4). The released TG vapours were monitored using TG-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The thermochemical activation energy (Ea) were studied by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Friedman, and Vyazovkin models. The pyrolysis results showed that WS and LDPE could be completely decomposed as a single reaction up to 600 °C and 520 °C, respectively. Aromatic-carbonyl and CO2 were the main FTIR functional group for WS vapour versus -CH2- for LEDP vapour. The GC/MS analysis of WS showed various compounds such as sec-Butylamine (11.88 %), acetic acid (10.68 %), etc., while LDPE showed many compounds without specific trend even when the heating rate was changed. While the co-pyrolysis results showed that WS/LDPE could be decomposed individually in two successive reactions at 335 °C (WS) and 495 °C (LDPE). These results were confirmed by FTIR and GC/MS which showed that the functional groups and chemical compounds of vapour generated at these decomposition zones have similar characteristics to those obtained from pyrolysis of WS and LDPE. Finally, kinetic analysis showed that WS-Baltic (227–250 kJ/mol) is more complex compared to WS-Asian (163–217 kJ/mol) due to its higher ash content. While Ea of WS/LDPE was increases upto 274–291 kJ/mol (1:1), 266–297 kJ/mol (2:1), 268–289 kJ/mol (3:1), and 278–299 kJ/mol (1:4).

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising technique to achieve the sustainable utilization of heavy metal hyperaccumulator derived from phytoremediation of contaminated soils. To investigate the feasibility of synergistic treatment of hyperaccumulator and plastic waste (i.e. polyvinyl chloride, PVC), co-pyrolysis of Sedum alfredii and different mass percentages of PVC (5–25 wt%) was conducted at 300–900 °C in the present study. High pyrolysis temperature and low PVC addition amount (5 wt%) effectively promoted the volatilization of Cd and Zn from S. alfredii, while high PVC addition amount (15 wt% and 25 wt%) caused a significant suppression effect at insufficient pyrolysis temperatures. After PVC addition, the yields of biochar increased by 5.18–37.19% as compared with the theoretical values. However, the concentrations of Cd and Zn leached from biochar significantly elevated with increasing PVC addition amount, indicating that the addition of PVC improved the mobility of Cd and Zn in biochar. Moreover, S. alfredii derived biochars showed considerable sorption capacity for Cd (87.6–198.3 mg/g).

High-density polyethylene (HDPE), two-component mixture (LDPE/PP) and three-component mixture (HDPE/LDPE/PP) were thermally decomposed in a batch reactor at 450°C, thus forming oil/wax products. Subsequently, these products were dissolved in heavy naphtha in the amount of 10 mass% to obtain steam cracking feedstock.

The obtained results were compared with the product composition from steam cracking of naphtha at identical experimental conditions. The decomposition of polyalkene oils/waxes during copyrolysis was confirmed on the basis of analysis of liquid products. It was shown that more ethene and propene was formed during copyrolysis of oil/wax from HDPE in comparison with naphtha and both mixtures and so oil/wax from HDPE seems to be favourable component of steam cracking feedstock. There were slight differences between product compositions from copyrolysis of two- and three-component mixtures. The presence of HDPE in three-component mixture supported formation of gas and ethene. The presence of oil/wax form PP enhanced formation of propene and branched alkenes.

Abstract: The complete disposal of waste plastics (WPs) is a serious challenge in today’s world. One of their streams originates in growing number of end-of-life vehicles, where these materials are often mixed, and their mechanical recycling is practically impossible. However, their complete neutralization can be achieved by the process of thermochemical conversion. The obtained pyrolytic oil can enter into the supply chain after the cracking process in the petrochemical industry. The paper draws attention to the prospects of using various fractions obtained after distillation of oil from the pyrolysis process of mixed waste plastics from end-of-life cars, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), which are currently difficult to process in a traditional way. Four types of waste were tested: polyolefin waste (POW) in the form of a 1:1 PE:PP blend, ABS and POW-ABS blends in the ratios of 4:1 and 3:2. Their physicochemical properties were investigated and thermogravimetric analyses (TG/DTG/DSC) coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were performed. As a result of pyrolysis, a broad hydrocarbon fraction (BHF) was isolated, which was subjected to atmospheric distillation leading to wax, naphtha and gasoline fractions. Their properties were determined and some applications indicated. Mixing polyolefin waste with ABS in a 4:1 ratio in the pyrolysis process increased the yield of liquid products (BHF) by approximately 18 % and reduced the amount of pyrolysis gas by approximately 64 % compared to the amount from POW pyrolysis; in the case of a 3:2 ratio, the effects were much smaller – 4 % and 25 %, respectively.

The results revealed that the silicon pillars contributed to the catalyst’s excellent thermal stability to withstand temperatures of up to 1000 °C, while the transition-metallic species (e.g., Co/Ni/Fe) contributed to the fine-tuning of the catalyst’s acidity and porosity.

Abstract: Pyrolysis offers the possibility to convert waste tires into liquid and gaseous fractions as well as a carbon-rich solid (CBp), which contains the original carbon black (CB) and the inorganic compounds used in tire manufacture. Whilst both liquid and gaseous fractions can be valorized without further processing, there is a general consensus that CBp needs to be improved before it can be considered a commercial product, seriously penalizing the pyrolysis process profitability. In this work, the CBp produced in a continuous pyrolysis process was demineralized (chemical leaching) with the aim of recovering the CB trapped into the CBp and thus, producing a standardized CB product for commercial purposes. The demineralization process was conducted by using cheap and common reagents (HCl and NaOH). In this sense, the acid treatment removed most of the mineral matter contained in the CBp and concentration was the main parameter controlling the demineralization process.

Abstract: The co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic with Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts were studied to improve the aromatic production. The Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method and characterized by BET, XRD, NH3-TPD and SEM methods. The effects of Si/Al ratios of ZSM-5, Zn loadings, catalytic temperatures, and mass ratios of feedstock-to-catalyst on the selectivity and composition of aromatics in the liquid products were investigated. It was found that under the optimal conditions of 5 % Zn loading, Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 of 120, catalytic temperature of 500 ℃, and mass ratio of feedstock-to-catalyst of 1/2, the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics hydrocarbons (MAHs) can reach 86.02 %, and the selectivity of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) can reach 59.10 %. Furthermore, the stability experiments demonstrated that the 5 % Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst maintained the aromatic selectivity of MAHs above 85 % after 10 cycles. The mechanism of co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic with Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts was also proposed, which indicates that the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst promoted the formation of aromatics via Diels-Alder and dehydration reactions between furan derived from biomass pyrolysis and alkenes produced from plastic pyrolysis.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass, no pure plastic oil composition data and no oil focus.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Nanosized ZSM-2 zeolite with crystal size of ∼100nm was synthesized and ion exchanged in order to characterize its behaviour in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) in a semi-batch reactor. The starting ZSM-2 allowed a reduction in the PE degradation temperature of more than 80°C as quantified by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). By either proton or Lanthanum exchanges, the nanozeolite increased the acidity improving even more these degradation processes. The starting nanometric catalyst was dramatically more active than a micrometric Y-zeolite displaying lower onset temperatures of PE degradation due to its higher external surface area. These differences nevertheless were reduced by ion-exchanging the Y-catalysts. Our results confirm the relevance of both the zeolite acidity and other parameters, such as crystal size and crystallinity of the zeolite framework, on the catalytic efficiency. Regarding the degradation products during the catalytic process, both zeolites increased the production of low boiling compounds being more efficient the ZSM-2 based catalysts reaching a yield about 90%. Higher amount of accessible sites active for cracking on the external surface of the nanosized crystals would be responsible of this high gas yield. Furthermore, ZSM-2-based zeolites were highly selective to propylene and C4 compounds compared with Y-based zeolites.

Abstract: To address the challenging issues of waste plastic pollution and petroleum shortage, we report herein a pulse pressurized catalytic pyrolysis process where polyethylene is continuously converted into aromatics using HZSM-5 catalyst incorporated with hydrated SiO2. Pressurization improves the activity of single-pulse pyrolysis of polyethylene by 14.42%. In contrast to the linear decrease of BTEXS relative yield with a K value of − 0.23 under non-pressurized conditions, pressurization results in a notable stability in the latter stage, characterized by a K value of only − 0.063. Comprehensive catalyst characterization demonstrates that pressurization promotes the release of water from hydrated SiO2, enabling HZSM-5 to effectively undergo dealumination and obtain suitable acidity and pore structure, and ultimately enhancing the resistance to carbon deposition.

Abstract: Although significant effort has been made to develop separation and sorting strategies for recycling mixed plastic waste in recent decades, these processes are often complex, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, and may not be efficient when scaled up. This research aims to evaluate the potential of a homogenization and dechlorination algorithm based on a remelting-restabilization technique to improve the homogeneity of heterogeneous mixed plastic waste through high-shear pulverization. The effectiveness of this method for chemical recycling in the presence of a synthesized clay catalyst was evaluated and modeled using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and kinetic studies. The results showed a significant increase in the homogeneity level of mixed plastic in terms of physical, thermal, and rheological behavior after two runs of extrusions. Additionally, the amount of chlorine in the mixed waste samples was reduced from 18.3 mg/kg to 1.45 mg/kg after thermal treatment at 300 °C for 2 hours. The inclusion of a modified clay catalyst resulted in a reduction in activation energy and initial degradation temperature by approximately 13% and 31%, respectively. The modeled kinetics results showed that the reaction rate in the presence of the catalyst increased at both low and high conversions over a wide range of temperatures. However, an increase in the number of extrusions only increased the degradation rate at high temperatures due to induced thermal history. Py-GC-MS test results revealed that the use of clay catalyst in homogenized samples enhanced the amount of low carbon atom products (C5 to C12) by 7.5% and 27% at 450 °C and 550 °C, respectively.

Abstract: Metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW) is the most complex part of plastic waste ever with poor recyclability. In order to close the circle loop of MFPWs and to increase their economic and environmental benefits according to the zero waste principle, this research aims to convert MFPWs into energy products (Microcrystalline paraffin wax and biogas) and raw materials (carbon particles and aluminum) using three combined approaches: pyrolysis, mechanical and chemical treatments. The thermal treatment using mini-pyrolysis plant (capacity of 250 g) was applied as the main treatment to convert MFPWs into three main energy products: biooil, biogas, and char mixed with aluminum flakes (Al/char) at 25 °C/min up to 500, 600, and 700 °C, while the mechanical treatment using milling process was used to break the bonds between char and Al flakes, thus liberating Al flakes after sieving process. Finally, the leaching process using hydrochloric acid was employed to extract the remaining Al particles from the milled Al/char and to recover the carbon particles simultaneously, using a density separation method. The experiments were performed on a mixture of five types of equal shares of packages (potato chips, chocolate, bakery, coffee, and biscuits). The obtained energy products and recovered materials were analyzed by GC, FTIR, ICP, and SEM-EDS. The results showed that MFPWs can be decomposed thermally into Al/char (99.4%) only up to 500 °C, while in case of 600 and 700 °C, they can be converted into microcrystalline paraffin wax (19.5%), biogas (63%), and Al/char (17.8%). Also, the mechanical and chemical treatments were succeeded by leaching >90 wt% of Al and extraction of carbon particles on a micro-scale (10–50 μm).

Abstract: Fe2O3–Al2O3 catalysts applied for conversion of polyolefin plastic waste into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and H2 are typically produced by impregnation, co-precipitation or sol-gel synthesis at atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 100 °C. This study utilized hydrothermal conditions and established the role of precipitating agents (urea, N-methylurea and N,N′-dimethylurea) on properties and catalytic activity of Fe2O3–Al2O3 catalysts (Fe-u, Fe-mu and Fe-dmu, respectively). The precipitating agent played a key role in tailoring the properties, such as crystallization degree, surface area and reducibility. The precipitating agents influenced the yield and outer diameters of MWCNTs but did not affect graphitization degree. Among the synthesized catalysts, Fe-u had the largest surface area and preferential formation of the highly reducible α-Fe2O3 crystalline phase. As a result, Fe-u had the highest activity during conversion of pyrolysis gas from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into MWCNTs, yielding 0.91 g·g−1-catalyst MWCNTs at 800 °C as compared to 0.42 and 0.14 g·g−1-catalyst using Fe-dmu and Fe-mu, respectively. Fe-dmu favored the growth of MWCNTs with smaller outer diameters. Fe-u demonstrated high efficiency during operation using a continuous flow of pyrolysis gas from a mixture of polyolefins (70 wt% polypropylene, 6 wt% LDPE and 24 wt% high density polyethylene) producing 4.28 g·g−1-catalyst MWCNTs at 3.2% plastic conversion efficiency and a stable H2 flow for 155 min (25–32 vol%).

Abstract: Pyrolysis and in-line catalytic decomposition of plastic waste were performed for the production of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) and hydrogen. A new catalyst, Ni-UGSO (Nickel-UpGraded Slug Oxide), was used in a continuous mode, and its activity was compared to that of a typical Fe/Al2O3 catalytic formulation. Moreover, the pyrolysis-catalysis of different plastics (virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE), used HDPE, and mixed plastics) was studied to investigate the effect of the plastic type on the quantity and quality of the produced CNMs. Ni-UGSO exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the production of CNMs and H2 of the two formulations tested, with yields of 56.6 kg/100 kgplastic and 13.2 kmol/100 kgplastic, respectively. The high activity and performance of Ni-UGSO were attributed to the synergistic effect of the Ni and Fe in Ni-UGSO. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results revealed that most of the produced carbon was in the form of carbon nanofilaments (CNFs) of different diameters, ranging from 8 to 90 nm. The use of mixed plastics as a feedstock decreased the yield of CNMs by 10 wt%, and a layer of amorphous carbon covered the CNFs.

The influence of performing the pyrolysis process under N2 atmosphere and vacuum environment was investigated with emphasis on the temperature profile, heating rate, and the yield and properties of the liquid oil obtained. Different ratios of WP to WCO (1:2, 1:1.5, 1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1) were also investigated.

The high heating rate resulted in shorter reaction time and lower power consumption, leading to lower energy consumption by the pyrolysis process. The liquid oil comprised C13–C24 hydrocarbons (aliphatics, aromatics) within the hydrocarbon range of diesel fuel.

Abstract: Both thermal and catalytic cracking of mixtures consisting of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a lubricating oil base have been investigated in a continuous screw kiln reactor, provided with two reaction zones operating at different temperatures (T 1/T 2). The incorporation of the lubricating oil into the plastic leads to a significant decrease in its viscosity which favors the mixture flow through the reactor. Thermal cracking at 450/500°C of LDPE–lubricating oil base mixtures with compositions ranging from 40/60–70/30 (%, w/w) led in all cases to their almost complete conversion (∼90%) towards a broad spectrum of C1–C40 hydrocarbons.

This result is related to both the lower reactivity of the oil compared to the pure polyolefin and to the poisoning of the catalyst acid sites by sulfur/nitrogen-containing compounds present in the lubricant oil base.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes is a promising recycling alternative to the disposal methods currently used for this type of residues (i.e. land filling or energetic valorisation). In order to optimize the yields of compounds obtained with this treatment, the knowledge of the parameters’ influence on the degradation process is of great interest. Pyrolysis temperature and volatiles residence time are the most influential variables in the process, since they affect the primary as well as the secondary reactions. In this work, the pyrolysis temperature effect on the primary and secondary reactions of the thermal and HZSM-5 catalyzed pyrolysis of HDPE is reported and evaluated, in the range 500–800°C. For this purpose, two different equipments have been used, i.e. a flash coil pyrolyzer (pyroprobe 1000), that allows us to study the primary products, since the extent of secondary reactions can be neglected, and a fluidized bed reactor, where the extent of the secondary reactions is significant. The results of the present study show that 1-hexene is the major product obtained when primary thermal cracking reactions are mainly taking place. However, the major compounds obtained when thermal secondary reactions are present in larger extension are propene at low temperatures and ethene at high temperatures. In catalytic pyrolysis, the effect of HZSM-5 is clearly evident at all temperatures evaluated, increasing the volatile yields in both equipments used. The influence of this catalyst is more significant in the primary cracking reactions showing an increase of the volatile compounds with the degradation temperature. In this case, propene is the main volatile product obtained reaching a yield of 30.6% at the highest temperature evaluated. When the presence of the secondary reactions is evident, using a fluidized bed reactor, the combined effect of generation and possible cracking reactions leads to a low-dependent product distribution on the degradation temperature, propene being the main volatile compound in the range of temperatures studied.

The BTEX production (245.33 mg/g) was considerably improved as compared to ex-situ catalysis of HZSM-5 (185.30 mg/g) and MCM-41/HZSM-5 (209.14 mg/g). Moreover, the total coke amount of tandem catalysis decreased to 14.25 mg/g than that of ex-situ catalysis of HZSM-5 (30.72 mg/g). The mechanisms analysis revealed that the pre-reforming effect of MCM-41 suppressed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation and coke deposition on the following HZSM-5 and meanwhile improved the utilization of internal acid sites for obtaining high-yield BTEX.",YES,NO,The study focuses on BTEX production and catalyst mechanism rather than oil composition or plastic fingerprinting.,TARGET_AROMATICS;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The current methods of disposing of plastic waste, such as dumping or burning, create significant ecological problems and cause irreparable damage to valuable resources. This is especially true for plastics with complex structures, like polyethylene foams (PEF). This study focuses on how the plastic composition affects the interactions, kinetics, thermodynamics, yield of pyrolysis products, and their characterization during the co-pyrolysis of date palm waste (DPW) and PEF. Co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted at three different heating rates (10, 20, and 30 °C/min) and with varying biomass ratios to plastic. The kinetic parameters were evaluated using different isoconversional techniques such as Kissinger Akahira Sunose (KAS), Vyazovkin (VZK), Ozawa Flynn Wall (OFW), and Friedman (FM). The average value of activation energy based on the Vyazovkin model is 96.31, 216.33, 232.85, 382.69, and 206.47 kJ/mol for DPW, PEF, 75PEF25DPW, 25PEF75DPW, and 50PEF50DPW, respectively. The thermodynamic results showed that the average difference between activation energy and enthalpy is 4.89, 6.02, 5.81, 5.36, and 5.61 kJ/mol for the DPW, PEF, 75PEF25DPW, 25PEF75DPW, and 50PEF50DPW, respectively. It is lowest for the DPW and highest for the PEF, whereas it is significantly lower for the mixes, indicating that the mixes consume less energy. Criado’s master plot suggested that the co-pyrolysis of DPW and PEF followed D1 (one-dimensional) and D3 (three-dimensional) reaction mechanisms. Further, co-pyrolysis results from the fixed bed reactor confirmed maximum bio-oil yield (38.85 wt%) was achieved at 50PEF50DPW ratio.

Experiments with various catalysts gave good yields of valuable hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions.

Abstract: Industrial plastic wastes (PE and PP) were pyrolysed in a novel industrial prototype, with and without a zeolite catalyst, in the range 390–430 °C. Notably, the operating temperature range was set after preliminary characterization of the feedstock by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis tests in a lab scale reactor. The liquid products collected from the prototype unit looked like oil and were collected in cooled traps. These oils were characterized for their chemical composition and their potential application and commerciality. TGA of the oils was carried out as a preliminary screening, providing indication on the volatility ranges of the sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to provide a more detailed indication on the chemical composition of the samples, in particular on the content and length of alkanes and alkenes as well as on the presence of trace compounds. Notably, prior to GC-MS analysis, the sample had to be dissolved in an organic solvent and dichloromethane (DCM) was selected as the best solvent, after an accurate screening process. Both the TGA and the chromatographic analysis of the samples highlighted a good quality of the pyrolysis liquid products obtained at 390 °C, with modest effects of the catalyst, despite, unfortunately, rather low yields. On the contrary, the quality of the products obtained at 430 °C was lower, but the yields adequate (about 70 %). The analysis of the condensed liquids produced has also shown that the effects of the catalyst at 430 °C appear not to be negligible. Indeed, it can be observed that the catalyst causes a decrease in the concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons with a number of C atoms greater than 25, but favors dehydrogenation, increasing alkenes concentration. These two factors are contrasting, therefore it cannot be considered that the catalyst improves the quality of the liquid products, making them more similar to a typical diesel oil. In order to test the commercial applications for the pyrolysis oils, additional analyses were conducted in independent labs, showing that, through mild chemico-physical treatments, the oil produced at 390 °C with catalyst is suitable as additive (20 %) for diesel fuel, while the lower-quality oils, as produced, can be mixed with heavy fuel oil (up to very high percentage) or with diesel oils in amounts as high as 5 %.",YES,YES,PE and PP single-polymer pyrolysis with detailed GC-MS oil composition data and oil yield information at varying temperatures.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

The modified catalysts can enhanced the reaction rate of the pyrolysis process and resulting in high syngas in the product yields. Especially cerium, lanthanum promoted catalysts can enhance the yield of syngas. The effect of the reaction temperature and nitrogen/oxygen ratio of the carrier gas was also investigated. The maximum syngas production was obtained with lanthanum catalyst (112.2 mmol/g (95%N2 and 5%O2), and 130.7 mmol/g (90%N2 and 10%O2) at 850 °C. Less carbon depositions was found at 850 °C or even by the using of catalyst and more oxygen in the carrier gas. The oxygen content of the pyrolysis-gasification atmosphere had a key role to the syngas yield and affects significantly the carbon-monoxide/carbon-dioxide ratio.

Abstract: An integrated process that includes catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic wastes and in-line catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis gas were conducted to simultaneously produce aromatics-rich bio-oil and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The influences of feedstocks blending ratio on the characteristics of bio-oil and CNTs were established. The reaction mechanism of carbon deposition during the system was also probed. The results showed that co-feeding plastic to biomass siginificantly enhanced the selectivity of monoaromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) from 5.6% for pure biomass to the maximum yield of 44.4% for 75.0% plastic ratio, and decreased naphthalene and its derivates from 85.9 to 41.7% correspondingly. The most synergistic effect on BTX selectivity occurred at 25% of plastic ratio. The multi-walled CNTs were successfully synethsized on Ni catalyst by utilizing prolysis gas as feedstocks. For pure biomass, the least CNTs yield with ultrafine diameters of 3.9–8.5 nm was generated via disproportionation reaction of CO which was derived from decarboxylation and decarbonylation of oxygenates on the ZSM-5 acid sites. With the rise of plastic ratio, sufficient hydrocarbons were produced for CNTs growth, endowing CNTs with long and straight tube walls, along with uniform diameters (~16 nm). The CNTs yield increased as high as 139 mg/g-cata. In addition, the decreased CO2 inhibited dry reforming with C1-C4 hydrocarbons and deposited carbon, avoiding excessive etching of CNTs. Thereby, high-purity CNTs with less defects were fabricated when plastic ratio was beyond 50% in the feedstock.

Abstract: The waste polyolefin composition varies regionally due to different sorting technologies, emphasizing the necessity for a robust catalyst capable of selectively converting pyrolysis vapors into valuable light olefins while maintaining stability. HZSM-5, a microporous catalyst, efficiently cracks polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis vapors rich in linear aliphatics. However, polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis typically yields branched olefins, potentially hindering effectiveness of HZSM-5 due to mass transfer constraints and coke blockage in micropores. This study modifies HZSM-5 through phosphorus impregnation, mesopore introduction, and steam treatment to evaluate the impact of acidity, pore size, and surface modifications on catalyst stability and light olefin selectivity during PP pyrolysis vapor cracking. Subsequent experiments reveal the superior stability of modified catalysts. Phosphorus-modified (P-HZSM-5ss) and mesoporous phosphorus-modified (P-mesoHZSM-5ss) catalysts retain 72 % and 80 % of their initial activity after 150 runs, respectively, while the parent HZSM-5 experiences a rapid 44 % activity loss. P-mesoHZSM-5ss demonstrates the highest light olefin selectivity (63 wt%) after 150 runs, attributed to improved accessibility of branched olefinic products to active sites within catalyst pores. Further optimization achieves exceptional light olefin selectivity of 84 wt% at 117 ms contact time and 550 °C, surpassing maximum selectivity of the parent catalyst. Comparative analyses of PP, PE, and mixed polyolefinic waste pyrolysis vapor cracking revealed the influence of polyolefin type on optimal operational conditions, stressing the need for flexibility in operating conditions to scale up the proposed polyolefin recycling method.

Abstract: The co-pyrolysis of agricultural waste, specifically biogas residue (BR), and plastic mulch film (MF) faces significant challenges in product selectivity control due to the unclear mechanisms by which heating rates influence reaction pathways. This study systematically investigates the synergistic effects of heating rates and blending ratios during BR-MF co-pyrolysis by comparing slow pyrolysis (20 °C·min−1, tubular furnace) and flash pyrolysis (instantaneous heating to 600 °C, Py-GC/MS). Flash pyrolysis at a 1:1 mass ratio substantially increases the total hydrocarbon yield to 79.93 %, exceeding the theoretical value by 50.99 %, driven by alkyl radicals (·CH3, ·C2H5) from MF cracking that selectively cleave C-O/C-N bonds in BR.

Unlike previous co-pyrolysis studies which had focused on the improvement of product yield or cumulative weight loss, herein, we present the synergistic effects on the mass decomposition rate or rate of generation of products during co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of temperature, and biomass-to-plastic ratio on rate synergy during co-pyrolysis. Rate synergy values up to 10% per min were obtained for biomass and plastic blends. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reactions in the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated using the Coats-Redfern method. Activation energies for agricultural waste and plastics blends ranged from 45 to 82 kJ mol−1 while that for wood wastes and plastic blends ranged from 53 to 112 kJ mol−1. Interestingly, the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of plastic was found to be lower during co-pyrolysis with biomass than in pure form. Moreover, biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis followed a two-stage degradation: biomass degradation from 200 to 400 °C and thereafter plastic degradation from 400 to 500 °C.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis is an attractive approach to chemical recycling of waste plastics, but the feasibility of this technology is challenged by a lack of viable technical catalysts that could perform properly in a large-scale operation. This calls for the scaling up of the catalyst from powders into shaped catalyst bodies with both the necessary physical properties and minimal mass transport limitations. A structured catalyst of ZSM-5/SiC foam was developed in this study to address this issue. The activity and stability of 4 differently shaped ZSM-5 catalysts were evaluated in a continuous process of the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene. The structured catalyst exhibited a stable selectivity to gasoline-range aromatic hydrocarbons of above 22% for 6 h under catalysis temperature of 450 °C and WHSV of 40 h−1, outperforming conventionally shaped ZSM-5 catalysts by up to 37 times. The superior stability was attributed to the enhanced mass transport associated with (1) the short diffusion path of the zeolite coating and (2) the tortuous channel geometry of the foam structure. The influence of important factors on the catalytic performance was also investigated, including coating layer thickness, ZSM-5 silica-to-alumina ratio, catalysis temperature, space velocity, and catalyst regeneration. The structured catalyst demonstrated excellent stability in all conditions and great potential to adjust product yield and composition by manipulating these factors, making it a promising catalyst for large scale operation of catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics.",YES,NO,The study focuses on catalyst performance and mechanism rather than plastic-specific oil composition or fingerprint data.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the main plastics used in food packaging products, which have a very short life and are rapidly transformed into waste, and accounts for 7 wt% of the total plastic waste generated. Current PET waste management, mainly via mechanical recycling and glycolysis, have encountered a number of issues: negative impact on the environment, segregation of waste and product separation/purification. Therefore other versatile alternatives such as pyrolysis should be employed to recover value-added products from waste. Benzoic acid a precursor in the food and beverage industry, derived from PET via thermochemical conversion opposed to the current manufacturing process from fossil fuel-based feedstock is considered as a promising approach. In this study, the effect of operating conditions i.e. temperature, catalyst to plastic mass ratio and volatiles residence time and their interactions on product yields and properties were studied. Sulphated zirconia (SZ) was first time used for catalytic pyrolysis of PET due to its high acidity and environmentally friendly synthesis. Results showed that up to 27–32 wt% benzoic acid could be recovered through PET pyrolysis at 450–600 °C at 20 s residence time.

Abstract: Scrap tires are the source of renewable energy and raw chemical products for the refinery, petrochemical and rubber industry. The results of thermal degradation of waste rubber performed in a new type of a tubular reactor with the molten metal bed are presented in the paper. The melting and degradation processes were carried out in one apparatus at the temperature 390–420°C. The time of the described conversion process is shorter than the time of catalytic cracking or pyrolysis performed in classical batch or continuous flow reactors. The process was carried out in the inside of the molten metal bed and on its surface. The problems encountered with: the disintegration of wastes, the heat transfer from the wall to the particles, cooking at the walls of the reactor, and mixing of the molten volume of wastes are significantly reduced. Three products: the gaseous (below 14wt.%), liquid (over 41wt.%) product and solid residue were obtained during the degradation of waste rubber. The streams of gaseous and liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography. The gaseous stream contained hydrocarbons from C2 to C8 and the liquid product consisted of hydrocarbons C4–C24.

Abstract: Plastic waste has become a major hurdle in achieving a pollution-free environment for humans to live in. So, recycling used plastic is essential to protect the environment from degrading further. High-density polyethylene is a widely available plastic among the several types of plastics used every day. In the present study, waste HDPE was catalytically pyrolyzed utilizing different acids and alkali-activated kaolin catalysts in batch pyrolysis studies to screen the catalyst and optimize temperature for greater condensable oil output. The HNO3-treated kaolin gives comparably highest oil output with the least reaction time among all catalysts used in the experiment. Kinetics and thermodynamics of HNO3-catalysed pyrolysis of waste HDPE were analyzed from the thermogravimetric data at three heating rates.

Abstract: Due to the complexity and diversity of polyolefinic plastic waste streams and the inherent non-selective nature of the pyrolysis chemistry, the chemical decomposition of plastic waste is still not fully understood. Accurate data of feedstock and products that also consider impurities is, in this context, quite scarce. Therefore this work focuses on the thermochemical recycling via pyrolysis of different virgin and contaminated waste-derived polyolefin feedstocks (i.e., low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) as main components), along with an investigation of the decomposition mechanisms based on the detailed composition of the pyrolysis oils. Crucial in this work is the detailed chemical analysis of the resulting pyrolysis oils by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) and ICP-OES, among others. Different feedstocks were pyrolyzed at a temperature range of 430–490 °C and at pressures between 0.1 and 2 bar in a continuous pilot-scale pyrolysis unit. At the lowest pressure, the pyrolysis oil yield of the studied polyolefins reached up to 95 wt%.

The post-consumer waste feedstocks led to significantly less pyrolysis oil yields and more char formation compared to their virgin equivalents.

Abstract: Three types of plastics—polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and PC/ABS blend—were studied in this work. Kinetic analyses were performed using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) methods. The evolved volatiles during the pyrolysis of each material were analyzed, and the pyrolysis behavior was proposed using in-situ tools such as thermogravimetric analyzer-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (TG-FTIR) and gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection (Py-GC/MS). The three samples were also pyrolysed in a fixed bed reactor to elucidate the impact of secondary reaction. For PC, the activation energy increases as the reaction progresses. PC primarily generated CO2 and oxygenated compounds. For ABS, the activation energy experienced a slight decrease once the depolymerization reaction initiates, while a reversed trend can be observed at higher conversion rates. ABS pyrolysis mainly produced nitrogen-containing compounds and mono-aromatics. In the case of PC/ABS blend, a distinctive two-stage decomposition mechanism was observed. The interaction between PC and ABS in the blend promoted the formation of N/O-containing compounds. Additionally, this interaction enhanced the production of lighter phenols at the expense of bisphenol A, while ABS was not affected markedly. Stronger re-condensation and cracking reactions in the fixed bed system, facilitated the formation of poly-aromatics and lighter phenols (p-cresol and 4-ethylphenol) at the expense of bisphenol A during the pyrolysis of PC.

Abstract: Upcycling of waste plastic is an emerging topic in environmental chemical and process engineering. In this work, we investigated the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) over Fe-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of external H2 to produce hydrocarbon fuels at a mild condition (330℃). The critical interest is to achieve the mild conversion of PE by using the bimetallic catalyst to generate in-situ H instead of external H2 for hydrogenolysis. Results show that a slight impregnation of Fe on Pt/Al2O3 (Fe/Pt = 0.25) can improve the oil yield and light oil selectivity as well as promote the formation of aromatics and alkenes in oil after PE pyrolysis in a batch reactor. Multiple active sites including Pt, Fe and Lewis acid site of Al2O3 work systematically to drive the tandem catalysis without H2. The Pt plays the major role in PE pyrolysis via hydrogenolysis assisted by in-situ generated H, but shows the mutual inhibition with the acid site of Al2O3 that is contributive to PE cracking via a traditional carbocation chemistry. Fe modification on Pt/Al2O3 plays multiple roles in catalysis: promotes cyclization reaction, benefits the hydrogenolysis activity of Pt by providing active H during aromatic formation, and decreases catalyst acidity to reduce gas production. However, an over-impregnation of Fe (Fe/Pt = 1) partially covers the Pt sites, resulting in the decrease of fuel oil production but an increase in residue yield due to the deactivation of Pt sites.

Abstract: Plastic waste is a major environmental challenge globally as it can hazard the soil, groundwater, marine, and land creatures. It also emits several toxic gases in open environment when heated up. The ceaseless demands for plastic materials due to wide applications generated a high volume of plastic waste which can impact sustainability development. The present study reports synergism in co-pyrolysis of mixed waste plastic for production of value-added products with economic analysis and health risk assessment. The characterization results of mass spectroscopy and NMR revealed that the product contains different types of hydrocarbons such as paraffins, aromatic, cyclic olefins, and lower hydrocarbons. The physicochemical characterization of pyro-oil showed similar fuel properties to that of commercial diesel (CD). Blending of pyro-oil obtained from HDPE:PP (20:80) improved the fuel quality that results in high brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and reduced brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). At the maximum load condition, ∼19.17% and 29.43% enhancement in BTE were observed with 10% and 20% PO blending, respectively. Also, ∼23.4% of fuel consumption was reduced when 20% PO blend was used with CD. The results showed that the maximum CO emission of 30.93% could be reduced by blending 10% PO. The engine performance and combustion characteristics revealed that PO blended fuels emit low percentage of CO, NOx, CO2, and HC – which essentially suggest a better life style by minimizing the health risks via reduction in greenhouse gas emission that may cause cardiovascular collapse, seizures, coma, and sometimes death. Thus, the present study will help in valorization and mitigation of generated waste plastics through energy conservation and boost the circular economy.

Abstract: Chlorine (Cl)-containing chemicals, including hydrogen chloride, generated during thermal degradation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and corresponding mixture impede the chemical recycling of PVC-containing plastic wastes. While upgrading plastic-derived vapors, the presence of Cl-containing chemicals may deactivate the catalysts. Accordingly, herein, catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapor prepared from a mixture of PVC and polyolefins is performed using a fixed-bed reactor comprising zeolites. Among the H-forms of zeolites (namely, ZSM-5, Y, β, and chabazite) used in this study, a higher yield of gas products composed of hydrocarbons with lower carbon numbers is obtained using H-ZSM-5, thus indicating further decomposition of the pyrolysis vapor to C1–C4 hydrocarbons on it. Although the formation of aromatic compounds is better on H-ZSM-5, product distributions can be adjusted by further modifying the acidic properties via the alteration of the Si/Al molar ratio, and maximum yields of C1–C4 compounds (60.8%) and olefins (64.7%) are achieved using a Si/Al molar ratio of 50. Additionally, metal ion exchange on H-ZSM-5 is conducted, and upgrading of PVC-containing waste-derived vapor to aromatic chemicals and small hydrocarbon molecules was successfully performed using Co-substituted H-ZSM-5. It reveals that the highest yield of gas products on 1.74 wt% cobalt (Co)-substituted H-ZSM-5 is acquired via the selection of an appropriate metal and metal ion concentration adjustment. Nevertheless, introduction of excess Co into the H-ZSM-5 surface decreases the cracking activity, thereby implying that highly distributed Co is required to achieve excellent cracking activity. The addition of Co also adjusted the acid types of H-ZSM-5, and more Lewis acid sites compared to Brønsted acid sites selectively produced olefins and naphthenes over paraffins and aromatics.

The results showed that the presence of impurities (e.g., adhesive labels) reduced the initial activation energy of the pyrolysis reaction, and the pyrolysis process was extended and could be divided into two stages.

Abstract: Though catalytic pyrolysis through HZSM-5 has shown great potential to convert waste plastics, it is urgent to modify the catalyst to improve its catalytic performance due to the low liquid product yields and inferior selectivity to high value-added monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). During the study, two main modification methods, desilication via alkali treatment and Ga metal doping, were applied on HZSM-5 to reach simultaneous regulation of pore structure and acid site. It showed that selectivity to MAHs rose from 45.37 % to 58.45 % and 59.54 %, respectively, when 0.1 M and 0.4 M NaOH solutions were used for desilication.

Abstract: The resource utilization of waste polyolefin plastics is expected to be achieved through upgrading and reconstruction processes, but the primary scientific challenge lies in the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts. In this paper, we present Ni nanoparticles supported on Nb₂O₅ with tunable acid sites (Ni/Nb2O5-T) as noble-metal-free catalysts for the upcycling of waste plastics. These catalysts efficiently facilitate a one-pot, solvent-free catalytic hydrogenolysis of waste plastics, converting them into aromatic-free, highly branched alkane aviation fuels under mild conditions. Notably, the bifunctional Ni/Nb2O5-400 catalyst, characterized by highly dispersed metallic Ni sites and strong Brønsted acid sites, promotes key reactions such as hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, skeletal rearrangements, and β-scission of linear low-density polyethylene. This process achieves 100 % conversion with a yield of over 80 % for liquid products at 250 °C and 3 MPa H₂ for 4 h. The carbon distribution of the resulting liquid fuels primarily ranges from C6 to C18, with 71 % composed of isoparaffins, highlighting them as promising candidates for aviation fuels. Additionally, the Ni/Nb2O5-400 catalyst exhibits versatile activity, delivering high yields of highly branched alkane aviation fuels through the chemical upcycling of various types of waste polyolefin plastics.

Results suggested PU facilitated highly selective production of few-walled CNTs with small diameters and narrow size distribution while EVA tended to yield multi-walled CNTs. The synergistic interactions between pyrolysis gases components from PU and EVA allowed facile tailoring of CNT size distribution by using either sorted PU and EVA or mixture (EVA/PU) in appropriate ratios.

The effects of catalysts and their average grain size on the properties of main degradation products (gases, gasoline, diesel oil) are discussed.

Abstract: The directional pyrolysis of waste plastics into chemicals is limited by the poor access of long-chain paraffin primary vapors to the acid-sites in zeolite micropores during the reaction. We propose enhancing light aromatics (BTEX) production in polypropylene catalytic pyrolysis using encapsulated ZSM-5@SBA-15 composites. The SBA-15 silica encapsulation pre-cracks the bulky paraffins into light aliphatics, enriches these intermediates, and facilitates their diffusion into the ZSM-5 core micropores via the interconnected meso-micro interface, improving the accessibility of internal acid-sites. Through this designed structure, the plastic is sequentially cracked and aromatized into BTEX. Compared to conventional ZSM-5, the composite increases BTEX yield by 49.1 %, reduces heavy hydrocarbons by 42.2 %, and doubles the light-to-heavy hydrocarbon ratio. Acidity analyses and DFT calculations confirm that the encapsulation passivates the external acid-sites of ZSM-5 core, suppressing oligomerization and hard coke formation.

Abstract: The heating rate would significantly impact the pyrolysis process, especially for the reactions containing synergistic effects between two different feedstocks. Co-pyrolysis of two widely available biomass (CC–corncob and PS–peanut shell) with plastic (PET–polyethylene terephthalate and PVC–polyvinyl chloride) was studied in a concentrating photothermal thermogravimetric analysis (CP-TGA) system at three heating rates (100, 500, 1000℃/min). The TG and DTG curves of CC and PS differ due to their polymeric components (holocellulose and lignin); two pronounced levels at 100 and 500 ℃/min heating rates were present in PVC. With increasing heating rate, the lateral shift towards higher temperature regions in the TG and DTG curves exceeded 100 °C. The synergistic effects on the blend samples were concentrated in the main decomposition region (250–580℃) due to rapid volatiles release, and the discrepancy values further stabilized at the final decomposition stages. The activation energy (Ea) was assessed using a comparative study of isoconversional methods, namely Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and Starink. The isoconversional methods demonstrated that the co-pyrolysis process required about 30 % less activation energy than the pyrolysis of plastic (PET/PVC) alone. Coats-Redfern's (CR) model-fitting approach was used to identify the kinetic triplet of the devolatilization stage. The CR models revealed that biomass–PET blends belong to two to four-dimensional diffusion models, whereas biomass–PVC blends are dominated by chemical reactions of 1.5 and 2 orders.

The behaviour of LDPE and HDPE has been compared, and no differences in the quantity and weight fraction of the gaseous products obtained have been found. For both polymers, n-paraffins are the major products at the very beginning of the process, while as the decomposition proceeds 1-olefins are more abundant. The condensed fraction is much larger than the gaseous fraction and its analysis reveals some differences between the behaviour of LDPE and HDPE at the beginning of the degradation process.

The formation of 1-olefins and n-paraffins begins at slightly lower temperatures than for dienes and olefins.

Abstract: Pyrolysis oil can be used as a precursor to synthesize value-added biochemicals. Co-pyrolysis of two or more feedstocks generally improves the selectivity and yield of the target compounds. In this work, oil palm trunk (OPT) was subjected to single-feed pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis with polypropylene (PP) from 500 to 700 °C. The highest pyrolysis oil yield of 26.33 wt.% was obtained from OPT at 700 °C, which mainly contributed by the lignin decomposition in OPT. Phenolics (51.77–57.78%) and oxygenates (36.31–46.99%) were the major compounds detected in the OPT-derived pyrolysis oil. The addition of PP enhanced the formation of hydrocarbons (5.19–10.22%) and decreased the contents of phenolics (34.01–41.85%) in the co-pyrolysis oil. In the case of co-pyrolysis, the intermolecular reactions between PP and OPT-derived radicals led to the formation of ketones and alcohols, which contributed to the increase of oxygenates content. The highest oil yield of 16.17 wt.% was obtained at 600 °C from co-pyrolysis, the oil of which contained mainly phenolic compounds, oxygenated compounds (i.e., ketones and furans), and hydrocarbons.

Abstract: Reverse polymerization of waste polystyrene (PS) was exploited to produce styrene and other aromatics through microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP), due to the benefits associated with microwave (MW) heating.

A clear and low viscosity liquid containing styrene was always collected as the major product, together with low amount of char and gas. Using a MW power of 3kW and 100g of PS together with 47.3g of carbon gave a liquid (yield 86.5%) containing higher amount of single ring aromatic compounds, as evaluated by GC–MS (aromatics C6–C10 93.9%, styrene 66.0%) a char (yield 9.8%) and a gas (yield 3.7%). Improvements in residence time, by using low MW power or a fractionating system directly inserted over the oven and before the collecting system, allowed us to obtain a liquid with low viscosity and density even if the char yield was 10.0%.

Abstract: Automobile shredder residues (ASR) are the rejection of the present processes of metal recovery of end-of-life vehicles. They are composed of several plastics, foams, glasses, rubbers, textiles, remaining metals, soils, etc., and have no clear recycling alternative. In the pyrolysis process (heating to moderate temperatures without oxygen), the organic volatile matter of the waste (plastics, rubber, etc.) is decomposed to gases and liquids, which can be useful as fuels and/or chemicals source. The inorganic components (fillers, metals, glasses, etc.) can be recovered and reused. Therefore, pyrolysis is especially appropriate for recycling complex wastes, such as ASR. In this paper an experimental study of pyrolysis of real ASR samples coming from an automotibile shredder plant (light and heavy ASR) have been studied. The pyrolysis experiments have been carried out in a non-stirred batch 3.5dm3 autoclave at 400, 500 and 700°C for 30min. The raw samples, as well as the solid, liquid and gaseous pyrolysis products have been thoroughly characterized. It is concluded that pyrolysis appears to be an appropriate technique for recycling the heavy ASR, since valuable solids (38–39%), liquids (20–29%) and gases (31–41%) are obtained, while this is not the case for the light ASR, which does not yield valuable products. Concerning temperature 500°C is enough to produce total decomposition of the ASR organic matter.

Abstract: The safe and efficient utilization of waste medical masks has attracted worldwide attention. Fast pyrolysis with the catalysis of zeolites can provide a promising route for the production of value-added aromatic hydrocarbons from waste medical masks. Herein, HZSM-5 was employed and modified by metal loading (Ga, Mo) and alkali treatment for the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of mask filters. The non-catalytic pyrolysis of mask filters only led to a low yield of aromatics. When HZSM-5 catalysts were employed, the liquid long-chain olefins, cycloalkanes, and alcohols, as well as gaseous light hydrocarbons were mainly converted into aromatics. According to the micro-scale pyrolysis experiments, the alkali treatment as well as Ga and Mo loading further promoted the generation of aromatics, with aromatic yields of 52.8 wt%, 54.1 wt%, and 46.3 wt%, respectively. For alkali treatment, the NaOH concentration of 0.3 mol/L was most effective for aromatic production, due to the moderate change in the pore size. For metal loading, Ga loading had better performance than Mo loading because the former resulted in a higher specific surface area while the two modified catalysts possessed similar acid activity. When the two modification methods were combined, the yields of aromatics increased to 56.7 wt% and 60.3 wt% under the catalysis of Mo/Na-HZSM-5 and Ga/Na-HZSM-5. Based on the lab-scale experiments, the aromatic yield could reach 63.0 wt% with the catalysis of Ga/Na-HZSM-5, accompanied by a high selectivity of 87.6% for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs).

Abstract: The recycling and upcycling of waste plastics into high-value products by pyrolysis is a critical challenge caused by its time/energy-consuming problems, which can be overcome by employing microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis due to its rapid pyrolysis rates and high product yields. This study presents a facile method for the synthesis of catalysts for microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics, utilizing the pyrolytic products as raw materials. In this case, a microwave thermal shock strategy is developed to efficiently anchor iron nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This method recycles a portion of pyrolysis products back into the catalyst pool for plastic transformation into new CNTs, reducing the consumption for preparing additional catalysts. The precursors exposed to 50 W microwave irradiation reaches above 2000 °C within seconds, allowing Fe nanoparticles to be uniformly impregnated within the carbon nanotube matrix. The formed iron-doped CNTs shows high activity for microwave-assisted pyrolysis, generating CNTs with D/G ratios at 0.31. The recycling and reconstruction of CNTs after multiple pyrolysis form a cross-lined network structure, which facilitates electron transition and can be utilized for fabricating electrocatalysts. Nitrogen doping further improves the onset potential to 0.923 V vs. RHE, making them viable candidates for electrocatalytic applications in oxygen reduction reactions.

Abstract: Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) as an emerging engineering plastic has shown a big potential in recent years to produce Hydrogen (H2) for clean energy through high-temperature pyrolysis. This paper investigates the H2 production capacity and mechanism due to the pyrolysis of PEEK at high temperatures. The results revealed that PEEK has two pyrolysis stages in the temperature ranges of 783–905 K and 905–1173 K respectively. In the first stage, approximately 45 % mass loss was observed with an activation energy of 210.55 kJ/mol. However, only 0.93 mg/g of H2 was produced. According to fourier transform infrared, the main source which generated that H2 is the small amount of H atoms caused by the C-H bonds cracking. The H atoms were then recombined into H2 in the gas phase. The second stage of pyrolysis predominates the productions of H2, with around 11 % mass loss and an activation energy of 411.47 kJ/mol occurred. The H2 yield reaches 9.84 mg/g at 1073 K in this stage. The H2 is mainly generated by dehydrogenation of benzene rings and a small amount of -CH3 and -OH bonds. As the temperature raised, free radicals released by the breakdown of PEEK network recombined, suggesting three potential pathways for H2 production: (1) the dehydrogenation recombination of phenoxybenzene radicals to form dibenzofuran, (2) the recombination of benzene radicals to form biphenyl and naphthalene, and (3) the reaction of phenol and benzene at high temperature to form dibenzofuran, leading to recombination of H atoms into H2.

Abstract: Plastics are extensively employed in agriculture, generating an enormous volume of plastic waste. This study investigated the pyrolysis of silage film waste (SFW) to enable its conversion into energy/value-added chemicals. CO2 was chosen as the reactive medium to provide green pyrolysis. Nevertheless, the results showed that most of the carbon in the SFW was assigned to wax-like oil formed by thermal cracking. It was presumed that the reactivity of CO2 was effective only under certain optimal temperature conditions. To this end, the test setup was modified to increase the residence time of the reactants (CO2 and volatiles from SFW). With respect to inert gas conditions, syngas formation was observed under CO2 conditions. The enhanced formation of syngas was realised by the simultaneous reduction of CO2 into CO and the oxidation of volatiles into CO. CO2 also enhances the thermal cracking of volatiles, leading to enhanced formation of C2-hydrocarbons. These features provide an effective means of decreasing the aromaticity of oil from SFW pyrolysis.

Abstract: Thermosetting polymers are used in a wide range of applications due to their robust mechanical strength and superior flame retardancy. Despite these technical benefits, recycling of thermosetting polymers has been challenging because of their crosslinking nature. Moreover, their disposal through conventional methods (landfill and combustion) poses environmental concerns, such as microplastics and air pollutants. To address these issues, this study introduces a thermo-chemical disposal platform for thermosetting polymer wastes that employs carbon dioxide (CO2) as a reactive medium. In this work, melamine-formaldehyde was used as model compound of thermosetting polymers. In single-stage pyrolysis, it was revealed that CO2 plays a crucial role in controlling in the compositional matrices of pyrolytic gases, liquid products, and wax. These compositional changes were attributed to the homogeneous reactions between CO2 and the volatile compounds released from the thermolysis of MF. To enhance the thermal cracking of the MF, a double-stage pyrolysis process was tested, which increased the production of pyrolytic gases and eliminated wax formation. However, the slow kinetics governing the reactivity of CO2 limits the occurrence of homogeneous reactions. A nickel-based catalyst was used to accelerate reaction kinetics. The catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 conditions led to substantial increases in syngas (H2 and CO) production of 880% and 460%, respectively, compared with double-stage pyrolysis.

Abstract: The discarded bakelite cannot be easily recycled into useful products as it gets charred upon heating.

Abstract: Thermal pyrolysis offers a promising chemical recycling strategy for plastic waste, facilitating the transformation of polymers into valuable hydrocarbons with minimal pre-treatment and low operational costs. Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms and detailed characterization of initial pyrolysis products remain insufficiently explored. In this work, two advanced in-situ photoionization mass spectrometry techniques—Synchrotron Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoionization Mass Spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) and Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (APPI-HRMS)—were synergistically employed to comprehensively investigate the primary products and key intermediates of polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis under controlled conditions. Utilizing a SiC microreactor with short residence time of <1 ms, SVUV-PIMS identified 43 pyrolysis products, encompassing monomers, dimers, trimers, and some secondary aromatic hydrocarbons. Photoionization Efficiency (PIE) curve analysis further enabled the structural determination of 10 key intermediates. Concurrently, APPI-HRMS provided high-resolution mass spectrometric data over an extensive mass range (mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 50–600), uncovering additional secondary products such as naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and anthracene. Building upon these experimental findings, this study proposed detailed reaction mechanisms governing PS pyrolysis, delineating pathways for the formation of primary monomers, dimers, and secondary aromatic compounds.

Abstract: Novel proposal for the developed highly graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) over Co–Mo/MgO which served as a secondary support toward hydrogen production from low-density polyethylene waste (PE) was presented using two-stage system. Doping of Co3O4 with MoO3 into MgO exposed extra dispersion function through MoO3 and Co, Mo and MgO mixed oxides as well as further distribution of the active cobalt nano particles over the well graphitized thinner MWCNTs. Both of fresh and used Co/MgO and CoMo/MgO catalysts were characterized by XRD, TPR, Raman, TEM and TGA. Furthermore, the concentrations of released hydrogen through the reaction period were detected via online gas chromatography within 150 min. It was found that Mo improved the overall catalyst reducibility to be easier and distributed the active species in different forms of mixed species. Moreover, the catalytic performance toward hydrogen production from low density polyethylene waste was jumped from 51% to 81% after Mo addition within the reaction end. Also, full catalytically action was noticed for CoMo/MgO toward whole the charged hydrocarbon gases from the first decomposition stage without any deactivation.

Abstract: This study evaluated and compared the bio-oil yield produced from the co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch (EFB) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) feedstock using four calcium oxide (CaO)-based catalysts. Three catalysts were derived from waste sources, namely, clamshell (CS), eggshell (ES), and chicken bone (CB), whereas Malaysia dolomite (MD) was extracted from limestone.

Abstract: A one-pot approach was used to convert polyethylene (PE) with different chain structures into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) under the combined catalysis of CuBr and NiO at 700°C, including linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). The effect of chain structure of PE on the yield, morphology, microstructure, phase structure and thermal stability of CNMs, including cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CS-CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), were investigated by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. In addition, the degradation products from different chain structures of PE under the catalysis of CuBr were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. It was demonstrated that the branched structure played an important effect in the degradation products of PE. The dehydrogenation and aromatization of LLDPE were remarkably promoted by Br radicals from the decomposition of CuBr to form a large amount of light hydrocarbons and a relatively small amount of aromatics, favoring the formation of long and straight CS-CNTs. However, the degradation of LDPE was not obviously influenced by Br radicals due to its high extent of branched structure, while the random cleavage of HDPE was accelerated with the formation of a lot of olefins with long chains, resulting in the formation of short and winding CNFs.

Abstract: The effects of temperature and pressure on product distribution were investigated by catalytic slow pyrolysis of polystyrene in a fixed bed. Simultaneously, the catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene was carried out in a fixed-fluidized bed to study the effects of temperature and reaction time on the product distribution. The slow and fast pyrolysis experiments of polystyrene were conducted using γ- Al2O3 (basic) as catalyst and silica sand as control group.

We extracted pyrolysis oil, rich in hydrocarbons spanning a broad range of chain lengths (C7 to C32), from household plastic waste and employed a genetically engineered β-oxidation-blocked Candida tropicalis strain to convert this oil into α,ω-diacids of various chain lengths. Simple distillation at 200 °C enabled the extraction of medium-chain hydrocarbons from the pyrolysis oil. However, an increased ratio of medium-chain alkenes posed a toxicity challenge to the cells. Through hydrogenation, these medium-chain alkenes were fully converted to alkanes. Remarkably, cell growth was maintained even with an 8% concentration of hydrogenates. The subsequent biotransformation yielded medium-chain diacids, with 94.3% of the produced α,ω-diacids being of medium-chain length (C7 to C14).

Abstract: Undeniably, non-sanitary landfills existing worldwide pose considerable environmental risks related to air, water and soil pollution. Despite that, the landfill mining concept does not spread swiftly around the world. To prevent its fading into oblivion, it is necessary to transform the perception of landfills as waste to seeing them as stocks of valuable materials. Guided by this idea, this novel study investigates the possibility of producing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen-rich gas, materials crucial for our transition towards a more sustainable future, from excavated waste as these. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on catalytic pyrolysis of excavated waste. For this purpose, excavated waste was subjected to pyrolysis followed by in-line catalytic decomposition of the produced pyrovapours. The impact of the catalyst type and catalyst bed temperature on the process performance was analysed. Six types of monometallic and bimetallic Ni- and Fe- based catalysts, synthesised using two methods (the sol–gel and the impregnation method), were considered. Three catalyst bed temperatures were taken into account, namely 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C. The results showed that the bimetallic catalyst prepared by using the sol–gel method (FeNi/Al_Sg) outperformed the other analysed catalysts, yielding 9 mmol/gsample_daf of H2 and 76 mg/gsample_daf of CNTs at 800 °C.

Abstract: Plastic waste can be regarded as potentially cheap source of chemicals and energy.

Though acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking reactions involve a large number of compounds, reactions and catalyst deactivation and are very complex, the model gives a good representation of experimental results from the degradation of post-consumer plastic waste. This model provides the benefits of lumping product selectivity, in each reaction step, in relation to the performance of the catalyst used and particle size selected as well as the effect of operation conditions, such as rate of fluidizing gas and reaction temperature.

Abstract: Pyrolysis technology, as a key method of waste resource utilization, its pyrolysis efficiency directly affects the feasibility of circular economy. However, conventional pyrolysis processes often rely on higher pyrolysis temperatures, which not only increase energy consumption but also lead to a more complex distribution of pyrolysis products. Therefore, developing a pyrolysis process that is low in energy consumption and high in added value is particularly important. This paper uses polyethylene, the plastic with the largest global production, as the experimental material, and systematically analyzes the evolution of multidimensional parameters (pyrolysis characteristics, pyrolysis function models, apparent activation energy, and conversion rate) during its pyrolysis process. Based on the evolution of the multidimensional parameters, the “threshold temperature pyrolysis process” for polyethylene was developed, and its feasibility was verified through experiments and ANSYS Workbench simulation. The research results indicate that the threshold temperature pyrolysis process has a lower pyrolysis temperature and forms a stable thermal field distribution during the isothermal stage. This stable thermal field distribution not only reduced energy consumption by 6.1 % through regulating the reaction pathways of free radicals, but also increased the pyrolysis oil yield by 11.5 %. Furthermore, the lower pyrolysis temperature and stable thermal field distribution under the threshold temperature pyrolysis process regulate the migration of pyrolysis oil components towards lighter fractions by slowing down the reaction rate and extending the residence time of long-chain hydrocarbons.

Abstract: Plastic pollution compromises the environment and human well-being, and a global transition to a circular economy of plastics is vital to address this challenge. Pyrolysis is a key technology for the end-of-life recycling of plastics, although high energy consumption limits the economic feasibility of the process. Various research has shown that the application of induction heating in biomass pyrolysis reduces energy consumption when compared to conventional heating. Nevertheless, the potential of induction heating in plastic pyrolysis is rarely explored. This paper presents an exploratory study on the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene in a fixed bed reactor through induction heating. An MFI-type HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 23) and an FAU-type spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst with distinctive Brønsted acidity and textural properties were used. A complete conversion of the plastic feedstocks was achieved within 10 min, even without a catalyst. Thermal pyrolysis produced wax (72.4–73.9 wt%) and gas products, indicating a limited degree of polymer cracking. Catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 and FCC catalyst significantly improved polymer cracking, leading to higher gas (up to 75.2 wt%) and liquid product (up to 35.9 wt%) yields at the expense of wax yield (up to 25.4 wt%). In general, the gas products were rich in C3 and C4 compounds. The liquid product composition was highly dependent on the catalyst properties, for example, the HZSM-5 produced high aromatics, while the FCC catalyst produced high alkenes in the liquid products. The catalyst acidity and textural properties played an essential role in plastic pyrolysis within the short reaction time.

In comparison with PE, the presence of PLA showed a more profound facilitation effect on the thermal degradation of wheat straw according to the thermogravimetry results. Compared with single wheat straw pyrolysis, the composite biochar derived from co-pyrolysis had a lower yield, a higher pH value and a lower ash content, which was further affected by the type and addition dose of plastic. The addition of PE and PLA promoted the transformation of organic P to inorganic P and low pyrolysis temperature and low-dose of plastic are beneficial to the retention of P in the composite biochar.

Abstract: Wax is a detrimental byproduct of plastic waste pyrolysis causing challenges upon its release into the environment owing to persistence and potential toxicity. In this study, the valorization of wax materials through conversion into BTEX (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) was achieved via catalytic pyrolysis using zeolite-based catalysts. The potential of two types of waxes, spent wax (SW), derived from the pyrolysis of plastic waste, and commercial paraffin wax (PW), for BTEX generation, was investigated. Using HZSM-5, higher yields of oil (54.9 wt%) and BTEX (18.2 wt%) were produced from the pyrolysis of SW compared to PW (32.3 and 14.1 wt%, respectively). This is due to the improved accessibility of lighter hydrocarbons in SW to Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in HZSM-5 micropores, promoting cracking, isomerization, cyclization, Diels-Alder, and dehydrogenation reactions. Further, the use of HZSM-5 resulted in significantly larger yields of oil and BTEX from SW pyrolysis compared to Hbeta and HY. This phenomenon is ascribed to the well-balanced distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites and the identical geometric structure of HZSM-5 micropores and BTEX molecules. The addition of Ga to HZSM-5 further led to 2.24% and 28.30% enhancements in oil and BTEX yields, respectively, by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst through the introduction of new Lewis acid sites. The regeneration of the Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst by removing deposited coke on the spent catalyst under air partially recovered catalytic activity.

The redox catalysts of Fe/Co/Ni oxide supported with Al2O3 were synthesized by the co-precipitation method with the molar ratio of 2:1 for the conversion of FMs. Results showed that the pyrolysis and in-line chemical looping cracking-gasification method could efficiently convert White FM into syngas with the H2 productivity of 93.84 mmol/g with Fe2Al.

Abstract: The catalytic pyrolysis of commercial wood plastic composite (WPC) over microporous catalysts was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and tandem micro reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TMR-GC/MS).

TMR-GC/MS indicated that the formation efficiency of aromatic hydrocarbons during the catalytic pyrolysis of WPC was affected not only by the catalyst properties, but also by the contact mode between the WPC and catalyst. The in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of WPC showed a higher aromatic formation efficiency than the ex-situ reaction because of the sufficient likelihood of a reaction between the reactant molecules and catalysts during the in-situ reaction. Among the catalysts, HBeta produced the largest amount of aromatics followed by HZSM-5 and HY. Diffusion hindering of the reactant molecules to the small pores of HZSM-5 and the large amount of coke inside the large pores of HY were the main reasons for the lower aromatic formation efficiency over HZSM-5 and HY than over HBeta.

The reaction temperatures were 500, 525 and 550°C, the mass catalyst to oil relationship was 6.35 and the contact times were from 3 to 30s. The study included the effect of the concentration of LDPE over conversion, the various product (dry gas, LPG, gasoline, LCO and coke) yields and selectivities. Results were very similar for the two concentrations. At typical conversions of 70wt.%, dry gas and gasoline yields increased about 10wt.%, LPG yields between 9 and 13wt.%, LCO yields decreased more than 15wt.% and coke yields were lower than 7.7wt.% The RON index of gasoline was improved slightly (up to one point), mainly due to significant increases in olefin concentrations, while the fuel quality of the LCO cut was not affected. LDPE is easily converted and seems to be subjected to primary reactions of catalytic cracking, thus increasing the yields of olefins in the LPG and gasoline boiling ranges. It was concluded that recycling waste LDPE by co-processing it as part of conventional feeds to the FCC would not interfere with the standard operation.",NO,NO,"The study focuses on co-processing LDPE with vacuum gas oil in an FCC unit, not on plastic pyrolysis, and reports only gas and liquid product yields without detailed oil composition data.",NO_PYROLYSIS;NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA

Abstract: The nature and mechanisms of synergistic effects observed during the co-pyrolysis of cellulose and low density polyethylene (LDPE), two major components in municipal solid wastes, were investigated at milligram and gram-scales. Pyrolysis of a mixture of LDPE and cellulose increased the yield of the liquid product, with an 83% increase in the energy recovery, compared to a mixture of the liquid products from pyrolysis of the individual components. Further experiments distinguished the synergistic effects during devolatilization and condensation, respectively. Synergism during devolatilization was investigated by mixing cellulose char (prepared at 400°C) with LDPE, and resulted in an increase in liquid yield, indicating an interaction between char and LDPE to promote liquid production. Solid-gas and/or gas-gas interactions occurred, where in the former the char acted as a catalyst rather than a reactant. For synergistic effects during the condensation process, LDPE was pyrolysed and the hot volatiles were condensed while the liquid products of cellulose pyrolysis were present in the condensation system, which also increased the liquid yield. Gas-gas and/or gas-liquid interactions occurred during condensation which enhanced the formation of the liquid phase. Moreover, the sum of the synergisms during devolatilization and condensation was similar to the overall synergistic effects observed during co-pyrolysis of the mixture, confirming the contribution of both to the overall positive synergistic effect on the liquid yield.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with biomass (cellulose) without separate pure plastic-only conditions and no focus on oil composition as a fingerprint.,CO_PYROLYSIS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: In this study, co-pyrolysis of low-lipid Nannochloropsis sp. (NS) and waste polystyrene (PS) was deeply investigated using TG-MS-FTIR and Fixed bed reactor to characterize their thermal behaviors, kinetics, evolved gases, and products distribution. The (D)TG investigation of the co-pyrolysis process revealed two distinct stages of thermal decomposition: the first stage (150–420 °C) was mostly caused by NS decomposition, whereas the second stage (420–550 °C) was attributed to NS-PS decomposition. The difference between experimental and theoretical mass loss (ΔW) was lower than zero when the proportion of NS was 75% and 65%. In addition, the average activation energy of the blends containing 75% and 65% of NS was less than sole NS. Thus, based on thermal behaviors and activation energies, the blends with an NS content of 75% and 65% exhibited the strongest synergistic effect. The results of TG-MS, TG-FTIR, and GC-MS analyses revealed that the co-pyrolysis considerably boosted the production of hydrocarbons, notably aromatic hydrocarbons, while concurrently restricting the production of nitrogenous and oxygenous compounds.

Abstract: The thermal pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a fixed bed reactor has been studied in the temperature range of 450–550 °C with two different nitrogen carrier gas flowrates, 2 and 4nullLnullmin−1, to study the effect of these process parameters as well as the resultant vapour residence times on the formation of wax and its chemical and thermal properties. The technology had a high selectivity to waxes, with a yield of up to 91.87% wax from high-density polyethylene at 500 °C using a nitrogen carrier gas flowrate of 4nullLnullmin−1 and subsequent 1.76 second vapour residence time, calculated using the ideal gas law. The waxes were characterised using techniques including gas-chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The process operating temperature especially and its subsequent effect on vapour residence times within the reactor had a considerable impact on both the chemical and thermal properties of the waxes. Higher operating temperatures yielded more olefinic waxes due to the promotion of degradation radical mechanisms such as β-scission. They were observed to have higher melting points and thermal stability. An investigation was conducted to assess the thermal properties and ageing performance of the waxes. Thermal conditioning in an ashing oven at 170 °C for 0–6 hours was conducted with a detailed analysis of GC-MS and FTIR at each stage of thermal exposure to further support thermal characterisation results. The changes in chemical composition were attributed mainly to oxidation and polymerization ageing reactions and were seen to be more prominent in the more unsaturated waxes produced at higher pyrolysis temperatures.

Abstract: The recycling and processing of plastic waste to promote resource sustainability has emerged as a global concern. Selectivily upcycling polyolefins into valuable monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) is a promising strategy to promote a circular economy but limited by low yield and selectivity. In this study, one-step microwave-triggered tandem pyrolysis coupling ZSM-5 catalytic reforming technology was explored, which is efficient for selectively transforming plastic into benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) riched oil products. Pyrolysis and catalytic processes were achieved by mixing plastic and ZSM-5 with graphite, respectively, and placing them in the bottom and top layers of the reactor. Results indicate the mass ratio of plastic or ZSM-5 to graphite and microwave irradiation power would influence the selectivity and yield of MAHs. After careful investigation, the optimum reaction conditions are deemed to be 600 W, and the mass ratio of LDPE and ZSM-5 to graphite is 3:1 and 1:1, respectively, and delightful selectivity and yield of MAHs of 82.06% and 28.12 wt% are obtained under the above conditions. More importantly, the BTEX accounted for a significant amount in the MAHs with the selectivity and yield of 70.53% and 24.17 wt%, demonstrating a strong ability to produce high-value BTEX, which is attributed to the ZSM-5 providing a sufficient active site for reforming the pyrolysis vapors and promote the formation of BTEX by cracking, aromatization and Diels-Alder reactions. Additionally, gas products are rich in C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 olefin monomers accounting for around 60% of the gas products, which also manifest high value. Besides, the ZSM-5 can be stabilized by exceeding three successive cycles, and this strategy is also suitable for the catalytic upcycling of PP and mixed plastics to produce MAHs selectively.

Abstract: The selective catalytic cracking of polyethylene (PE) into light olefins offers a sustainable route for plastic upcycling. Here, we demonstrate that controlling the strength and distribution of Brønsted (BAS) and Lewis (LAS) acid sites in FAU-type zeolites via kinetic regulation can dramatically influence activity and selectivity in PE cracking. Increasing crystallization time and temperature promoted the dislodging of framework Al, weakening BAS while enriching LAS, as confirmed by 27Al/29Si MAS NMR, XRD, NH3-TPD, and pyridine-FTIR analysis. The optimized HY-48h catalyst achieved ∼39 % yield of light olefins (C2 =-C4 =) and only ∼4.5 % coke, effectively doubling olefin output and reducing coke to one-fourth compared to conventional HY zeolite. Acidic properties-product distribution analysis revealed that weak BAS and increased LAS content promotes monomolecular β-scission over bimolecular cracking pathways, thereby enhancing light olefins production. Notably, the catalytic activity of the zeolites in PE degradation was closely linked to the strength of BAS. Furthermore, HY-48h maintained its performance in the cracking of HDPE and real post-consumer plastic waste, presenting strong catalytic resilience even in the presence of inorganic impurities.

Abstract: This paper presents an alternative approach for plastic waste valorization in a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor. The study evaluates the application of an upgraded spouted bed design for the steam cracking of polypropylene (PP) at 750 °C, focusing on high value added products. The highly efficient cracking process results in a high gas yield of 80.9 wt%. This stream is composed of H2, CO, CO2, C1-C4 paraffins and C2-C4 olefins, with the latter reaching a total yield of 49.2 wt%. Among the light olefins, propylene (21.8 wt%) and ethylene (16.5 wt%) are the most relevant. Interestingly, a remarkable yield of the valuable BTX fraction was obtained, 14.0 wt%, with benzene being the predominant compound.

Abstract: The widespread use and disposal of disposable masks have raised significant environmental and social concerns. In response to this issue, recent studies have explored resource recovery through the pyrolysis of discarded masks. However, limited research has been conducted on tuning the content ratios of active metal and applying various catalyst supports for targeting hydrogen (H2) and carbon nanomaterials. To address this gap, we implemented a two-zone catalytic pyrolysis system.

Impregnated catalysts (Ni(25)/Al2O3, Ni(25)/Zeolite 4 A) and LaNiO3 demonstrated comparable results in terms of hydrogen concentration up to 64.6 vol% and the structural purity of carbon nanomaterial by Raman Spectroscopy, suggesting that the nickel content ratio on the catalyst plays a critical role in hydrogen production during catalytic pyrolysis.

Abstract: The additional use of red mud (RM) on the catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (CFCP) of organosolv lignin (OL) and polypropylene (PP) over ex-situ HZSM-5 was investigated using a tandem micro reactor system. Non-catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of OL and PP increased their decomposition efficiency owing to the effective interactions. The in-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of OL over RM led to the enhanced conversion of large molecular OL pyrolyzates with the additional production of aromatic hydrocarbons. The in-situ CFCP of OL/PP over RM resulted in a further increase in the cracking efficiency of OL/PP pyrolyzates as well as an increase in the aromatics formation efficiency owing to the effective interactions between their CFP intermediates. Furthermore, the application of RM in 1st in-situ catalytic reactor was found to be the optimal catalyst system because the in-situ CFCP of OL/PP over RM can enhance the formation of the proper hydrocarbons precursors for the production of aromatics over ex-situ HZSM-5 in 2nd reactor. Compared to the one-step CFCP of OL/PP over ex-situ HZSM-5, two-step CFCP of OL/PP over in-situ RM and ex-situ ZSM-5 maintained the higher aromatics formation during the 7 times sequential reaction due to the slow deactivation of ex-situ HZSM-5.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass (organosolv lignin) and focus on aromatics production, with no reported oil composition data for pure plastic.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_AROMATICS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The recycling of polyoxymethylene (POM) was performed in a fluidised bed which was formed from cenospheres (hollow, spherical particles). Air, N2 and CO2 were used as the fluidising agents. The composition of the process products in the flue gases as a function of fluidised bed temperature is shown and discussed for each fluidising gas. A flue gases FTIR analysis together with the spectra deconvolution of multicomponent gaseous samples were used to conduct instant quantitative monitoring of the products of POM thermal degradation. At 400 °C, in atmospheres of either air or CO2, the process of POM thermal recycling was performed for the purpose of monomer recovery and obtained a near 90% efficiency of formaldehyde formation. At temperatures above 600 °C, it was found that the use of air or N2 leads to the recovery of energy or gas rich in CO, respectively. The CO-rich gas was obtained during the pyrolysis of POM when CO2 constituted the fluidising agent. The amount of CO in the flue gas was almost twice as large as the amount of carbon introduced into the process in the polymer material.

Abstract: To utilize the marine waste biomass and marine waste plastic efficiently, a new two-step catalytic co-pyrolysis process was proposed for considering the different pyrolysis characteristics of each biomass component. Marine waste polypropylene (PP) and Enteromorpha (EP) were chosen as raw materials. The widely used molecular sieve HZSM-5 catalyst was modified by different metal and characterized by SEM, XRD and BET. The effects of different modified catalysts on the two-step co-pyrolysis product distribution were investigated by a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor. The results showed that the Fe, Cu, and Co were successfully entered into the interior of the HZSM-5 catalyst pores and reduced the specific surface area and pore volume. Compared with HZSM-5, Cu/HZSM-5 increased the average pore size, which could decrease the diffusion resistance on the inner surface of the catalyst. The catalytic pyrolysis experiment results indicated that the modified catalysts decreased the oil yield but increased the gas yield. Moreover, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil was improved significantly by the catalysts, which decreased the contents of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds due to the deoxygenation and denitrification effects.

In this study, a novel Ni/purified carbon black catalyst was synthesized by impregnating active nickel metal onto a purified carbon black support. This catalyst was employed to facilitate the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) in the presence of water vapor, aiming to produce hydrogen-rich syngas while simultaneously achieving the valorization of purified carbon black. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were comprehensively characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, elemental analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) both before and after the reaction. Furthermore, the effects of varying nickel loading ratios on the gas yield and composition during the catalytic reforming of polypropylene were systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that nickel predominantly exists in its elemental form when supported on purified carbon black.

Abstract: Waste plastics pose significant environmental challenges and require effective management strategies. Catalytic pyrolysis offers a promising route for converting waste plastics into high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs), thereby enabling cleaner and circular carbon material production. In this study, a series of Fe/Al2O3 catalysts modified by chelating agents were developed using ethylenediamine (EDA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydroxyethyl ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA). An acid-washing process was also employed during the preparation of the Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. The addition of chelating agents effectively enhanced the dispersion of catalyst particles, improving the yield and characteristics of CNTs from pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) plastics. Among them, EDA and HEDTA suppressed particle agglomeration and reduced the average CNT outer diameters to 15.9 nm and 15.2 nm, respectively. In contrast, EDTA led to the highest CNT yield of 280 mg/gPP, but resulted in a larger average diameter of 19.1 nm due to the weakened metal-support interaction (MSI) associated with its strong chelating effect. H2-TPR and ICP-OES analyses further confirmed that the incorporation of chelating agents effectively weakened the MSI, suppressed the formation of FeAl2O4 and improved Fe dispersion. It was also revealed that Fe3C may constitute the catalytically inactive phase, as indicated by the inverse correlation between the Fe3C particle size and the average CNT diameter. After acid washing, the CNT yield of Fe(A) increased to 315 mg/gPP. While Fe(A)∗, EDTA∗ and HEDTA∗ increased the average CNT diameter, EDA∗ exerted negligible influence.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis is a promising chemical recycling technology to supplement mechanical recycling since plastics can be broken down into monomers or converted to the required fuels and chemicals. In this study, a microwave (MW) -responsive SiC foam@zeoltie core-shell structured catalyst was proposed for the catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins. Under microwave irradiation, the SiC foam core works as both microwave adsorber and catalyst support, thus concentrating the generated heat energy on the ZSM-5 zeolite shell, where the catalytic reaction takes place. SiC foam with an open cellular structure can also improve the global transport of mass and heat during plastics pyrolysis. In this work, the effects of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and alkaline treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite coated SiC foam under MW irradiation on the variations in product distribution from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pyrolysis were investigated at 450 °C. The results indicated that the appropriate acidity and pore structure were crucial to upgrading gas and liquid products. Particularly, the creation of a mesoporous structure in ZSM-5 zeolite via alkaline treatment could improve the diffusion of large molecules and products, thus significantly increasing the selectivity of high-valued light olefins and aromatics while inhibiting the formation of unwanted alkanes, which are expected in the chemical industry.

Abstract: Recycling of mixed plastic waste via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking towards light olefins is a promising solution for the ever-growing plastic waste crisis. However, the pyrolytic recycling pathway is still not established on industrial scale due to the large variety of pyrolysis oil contaminants that hamper the application in (petro-)chemical processes. In short, plastic waste pyrolysis oils are unfeasible for steam crackers without upgrading. In this work, depth filtration for the removal of particulate contamination from a post-consumer mixed polyolefin (MPO) pyrolysis oil was performed using three different filter media with different porosity. Comprehensive analyses using SEM-EDX of the retained particles as well as ICP-OES and GC × GC-FID of the filtered oils allowed to understand the efficacy of filtration. Most of the particulate contamination was removed by filtration leading to a reduction from 69 mg/L in the unfiltered sample to < 2 mg/L in the filtered samples. Particle characterization confirmed that the main contamination is composed of iron, calcium and silicon-based contaminants in combination with carbon-based species. It was confirmed by ICP-OES that after filtration, important contaminants such as nickel, vanadium and lead were reduced below contamination thresholds for steam crackers indicating that filtration is an efficient, and potentially cost-effective upgrading technique for pyrolysis oils.

Abstract: Thermochemical conversion is one of the most effective ways to upcycle organic solid wastes into fuels and/or value-added chemicals. In this study, the tandem hydropyrolysis/hydrocracking of polystyrene (PS) to produce ethylbenzene was studied using metal nitrides as catalysts.

Furthermore, nanocarbon loading reduced the ignition delay by more than 30 %. A higher nanocarbon concentration (5 mg/L) in LDPE reduced the ignition delay by up to 10 %, whereas a lower concentration (1 mg/L) in PP was sufficient to achieve a similar reduction.

Abstract: The continuous spread of COVID-19 has produced a large number of abandoned disposable medical masks (DMMs), which have a greater negative impact on the environment and biosafety. In response to this issue, a method for rapid microwave sulfonation, nitrification and oxidation of DMMs was proposed to convert DMMs with low carbonization efficiency into aromatic carbon with good thermal stability, which not only maintained 51 wt% of initial mass at 1000 °C, but also achieved in situ co-doping of S, N and O. Subsequently, porous carbons derived from DMMs were synthesized by self-activation pyrolysis, which avoided consumption of alkali and metal salts in the traditional activation process. It was further found that low pyrolysis temperature was not enough to produce enough active material H2 and H2O to obtain high specific surface area, while increasing pyrolysis temperature could adjust the specific surface area of as-prepared carbon, ranging from 52 m2·g−1 to as high as 890 m2 g−1.

Abstract: The catalytic properties of different catalytic materials on the pyrolysis of plastics have been extensively investigated.

Among the four catalysts, HZSM-5 obtained the most concentrated product distribution and the highest yield of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and it was found that the cracking of LDPE mainly occurred in its pores. Due to the large pore size and low concentration of acid sites, the main product type obtained by MCM-41 was olefins. In addition, it was found that HY reduced the pyrolysis temperature of LDPE and the activation energy of the reaction to the greatest extent.

Abstract: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waste can be a good candidate as feedstock for co-pyrolysis with biomass. However, the high chlorine content in PVC pyrolysis products constitutes a barrier to their use. One way to eliminate chlorine from PVC is dehydrochlorination. This study explores the co-pyrolysis of maize cob with dehydrochlorinated PVC, focusing on product yields, chlorine distribution, and thermal interactions. Virgin PVC was dehydrochlorinated at 593 K, achieving 99 % chlorine removal, and its thermal behaviour was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). For the three heating rates studied: 5, 10 and 30 K/min, HCl was the main compound released up to 593 K. Lab-scale co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 873 K with varying biomass-to-PVC mass ratios. Increasing the PVC content enhanced oil yield and aromatic compound formation, slightly increased char carbon content, and redistributed chlorine predominantly into the oil phase. The gas phase was enriched with hydrocarbons such as methane, ethene, and ethane.

A coal gangue-based catalyst was utilized in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor for the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to evaluate the co-production efficiency. H2 was yielded by PP and PE at 63.9 vol% and 66.5 vol%, respectively, with PP yielding 6.23 wt% more CNTs than PE.

These results indicated that torrefaction significantly enhance the fixed carbon content and energy density of pinewood, while reducing its volatile matter content and hydrophilicity. During co-pyrolysis with HDPE, the high hydrogen content of HDPE facilitates hydrocarbon formation, and torrefied pinewood further improves the product distribution.

Abstract: To address the pressing demand for sustainable energy in light of environmental challenges, this study explored the synergetic effects of the co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Ulva lactuca macroalgae to yield bio-oil and biochar. The objective is to enhance the bio-oil quality for wider usability and to combat marine pollution. By employing co-pyrolysis, notable progress has been achieved in bio-oil yield and quality, particularly in hydrocarbon content, through the integration of PET. The highest bio-oil yield of 37.91 % was achieved under optimal conditions at 500 °C with a feedstock mixture consisting of 40 % U. lactuca and 60 % PET. Under these conditions, the bio-oil exhibited a significant increase in hydrocarbon content, reaching 57.16 %, which is essential for improving its energy potential.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical process for converting organic waste into valuable products syngas, bio-oil, and biochar under oxygen-free conditions. Syngas, a combustible mixture rich in hydrogen (H 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), offers significant potential as a renewable energy carrier. This study investigates the catalytic effects of zeolite on syngas production from three distinct waste feedstocks: polyethylene (PE), olive pomace, and water hyacinth, using a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor (600 °C, 3 h residence time, N 2 atmosphere). Experiments were conducted with zeolite concentrations of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % (by weight) to assess its role in enhancing gas yield and quality. Results demonstrate that zeolite significantly improves syngas production by promoting cracking and deoxygenation reactions, leading to higher yields of H 2 and CO (key syngas components), reduced CO 2 and tar formation (undesirable byproducts), and feedstock-dependent performance, with polyethylene achieving the highest syngas yield (68 % at 30 % zeolite), followed by olive pomace (62 %) and water hyacinth (54 %).

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of biodegradable mulch films, they are often unsuitable for disposal in open environments and cannot be recycled in the same manner as conventional plastics; hence, an effective disposal method needs to be suggested. Herein, pyrolysis of biodegradable mulch film made of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid (PLA) was considered. The pyrolysis of the PBAT/PLA mulch film in CO2 yielded more non-condensable gases than the pyrolysis in N2 due to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles at 800 °C. At higher than 600 °C in CO2, reverse water-gas shift reaction considerably increased CO selectivity. Using CO2 in the pyrolysis suppressed the generation of wax and char, attributed to CO2 enhancing not only thermal cleavage of pyrolytic volatiles released from the PBAT/PLA mulch film but also O–H and C–H bonds existing on the substance. The CO2 pyrolysis agent forwarded the cleavage of the polymeric bond of PBAT to produce more monomeric compounds (e.g., adipates and phthalates), while it suppressed radical reactions to produce less polycyclic compounds and phenyls. Rising temperature raised the gaseous pyrolyzate yield and lowered the char and wax yields.

Abstract: With the increasing amount of waste plastics being used domestically and industrially, the disposition of those being not reusable is a challenging task. Herein, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics over seven types of commercial and home-made activated carbons was studied in a facile tube reactor. A central composite experimental design was further adapted to optimize the reaction conditions and up to 100 area% of the obtained liquid components belonged to jet fuel-ranged hydrocarbons, in which alkanes and aromatics accounted for 71.8% and 28.2%, respectively.

Properties of activated carbons were also characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, nitrogen gas adsorption, and chemical adsorption. It can be concluded that the acidity was a critical factor in determining the catalyst activity, where jet fuel-ranged alkanes and aromatics were favored by using activated carbons of weak and relevant strong acidity, respectively. Rising catalytic reaction temperature could enhance the aromatization of alkanes to increase the percentage of aromatics and release more hydrogen molecules.

Abstract: Pyrolysis, a promising method for extracting energy and value-added chemicals from municipal solid waste (MSW), encounters challenges associated with generation of inferior quality oil and low-quality char byproducts. In this context, this study proposed catalytic reforming of pyrolysis volatiles derived from MSW, using MSW char (MSWC) and modified MSWC-based catalysts to produce high-quality oil containing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAH), alkanes and alkenes, and H2-rich gas products. Three groups of modified MSWC-based catalysts are prepared through the activation of MSWC with Na2CO3, Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O and ZnCl2 for the reforming process. Experimental findings reveal that impregnating MSW with ZnCl2, specifically the ZnCl2/C-1:1 char from one-step pyrolysis, exhibits the most favorable catalytic performance, with a 47% selectivity of MAH in oil product, yielding > 25 wt% oil at 450 °C and a calorific value of 26.24 MJ/kg.

These results highlight that varying catalyst modifications to MSW char can effectively improve the production of distinct oil compounds, with Zn[OH]+ species and higher Lewis-acid content in the catalyst exerting a positive influence on aromatic hydrocarbon production; and Na2CO3 facilitating alkane production.

Abstract: Pyrolysis affords the conversion of plastics from Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) into oils with potential applications in the production of valuable chemicals and the formulation of liquid fuels. However, the presence of significant concentrations of halogens (Cl and Br) in these wastes represents an important limitation as it can lead to the generation of hazardous species that negatively affect the environment. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of a real WEEE plastic has been investigated using a reaction system that operates with continuous feeding of the raw material. The catalysts assayed include bulk metal oxides (Fe2O3 and CaO) and zeolites (ZSM-5 and USY), as well as hybrid solids obtained by supporting those metal oxides on the zeolites. Pre-treatment of the raw WEEE plastics by water washing allows the Cl concentration to be significantly reduced, but it does not affect the Br content. Thermal pyrolysis produces an oil fraction with a high yield (> 70 wt%) and a large concentration of halogens (700 ppm), even though the char produced effectively retains more than 90% of Br and Cl contained in the feedstock. During catalytic pyrolysis, the halogen content of the oil is further reduced obtaining the best dehalogenation results with the metal-modified zeolites. This fact evidences a synergetic effect derived from the high metal dispersion achieved over the zeolitic supports.

When comparing Pd, Pt, and Pt3Sn1, supported Pd in tandem with a Re2O7 olefin metathesis catalyst showed four-fold higher activity (surface area basis) compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 catalysts on the same support, mainly due to differences in the rate of hydrogenation. Catalyst preparation resulted in metal nanoparticles partially covered by ReOx, as seen from elemental mapping. Co-location of Re2O7 and Pd correlated with increased rates of hydrogenation (i.e., an increase in the rate of alkane formation and simultaneous lowering of the rate of alkene formation), with a reaction order in catalyst study that further supported this conclusion. The Pd and Re2O7 system displayed marked improvement compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 with Re2O7, and previous work, in the depolymerization rate of a linear polyethylene feedstock, with over 94 % reduction in polymer molecular weight in 15 h at 190 °C using less catalyst and increased reactant loadings, while keeping solvent to polymer consumption below 2.5.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on catalyst mechanism and alkane metathesis for polyolefin deconstruction, with no reported oil composition or liquid product fingerprint data.",CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: A newly infrared-heated reactor with a high heating rate (20 °C/s) was applied to explore the co-pyrolysis interactions between low-rank coal and waste polyethylene (PE), and further observe the effect of organic plastic additives (OPAs) in PE on co-pyrolysis interactions. PEs pyrolysis results revealed that white PE hose without additives (WPE) and black PE threading pipe with additives (BPE) exhibit significantly different product distribution. Co-pyrolysis results indicated that the addition of WPE in coal is conducive to forming tar, with a maximum tar yield increment of 6.23 wt% observed at coal/WPE (7:3). However, adding BPE in coal has a slight impact on the tar yield but significantly enhances the light fractions in tar, with a maximum light tar content increment of 6.00% at coal/BPE (9:1), revealing the interactions between OPAs volatiles and coal volatiles. The volatile-volatile interactions promote the cracking of waste PE to form short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and inhibit coal pyrolysis to generate aromatics and phenols. Furthermore, the chars from co-pyrolysis have a lower H/C ratio and higher C-centered radical concentration than coal char, further demonstrating that hydrogen has been transferred to the liquid products, which can provide an effective complement for understanding the co-pyrolysis interactions.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with coal and additives, with no clear focus on pure plastic oil composition or fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is one of the most widely used plastic materials. However, its non-degradable nature makes it a persistent pollutant that requires proper management. Pyrolysis has been recognized as a promising technology for converting HDPE waste into value-added products. The efficiency of HDPE pyrolysis can be enhanced through the addition of spent coffee grounds (SCG), a process known as co-pyrolysis. This study aims to evaluate the co-pyrolysis of HDPE and SCG by investigating the impact of heat sources on liquid fuel production. In this research, co-pyrolysis was conducted using microwave and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) heating, with variations in SCG:HDPE ratios, reaction temperatures, and microwave power. The results indicate that these parameters significantly influence the liquid fuel yield. The highest yield was obtained with an SCG:HDPE ratio of 1:3, for both microwave and LPG heating modes. GC–MS analysis revealed the composition of the liquid fuels, showing that hydrocarbons were the dominant components in both heating methods. The produced liquid fuels comprised organic compounds ranging from C9 to C18. Furthermore, fuel properties were assessed, demonstrating that the microwave-assisted process yielded a higher calorific value (42.11 MJ/kg), thereby validating its effectiveness over LPG heating.

Abstract: The synergistic effects on syngas observed in co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polypropylene (PP) were systematically investigated on a fixed bed reactor with tailored feedstock configurations in this paper. The synergistic effects focused on evolutionary and cumulative behaviors of evolved syngas were quantified by juxtaposing the results from co-pyrolysis of pinewood-PP mixtures with weighted results from the pyrolysis of pinewood and PP as individual components. Examination of different feedstock configurations revealed quantified contributions on volatile interactions and catalytic effect of char to the overall synergy. Results showed that syngas yield, H2 yield and CO yield with co-pyrolysis were promoted by 27%, 80% and 63%, respectively, as compared to the weighted aggregates from individual pyrolysis. Reduced char residue and improved energy yield in co-pyrolysis contributed to a remarkable enhancement in apparent thermal efficiency from 69.93% to 80.67%.

Abstract: The escalating accumulation of plastic waste has become a pressing environmental crisis, requiring innovative valorization strategies. This study investigated a microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) system employing low-rank coal (LRC) as a microwave absorber, HZSM-5 as an acidic catalytic matrix, and iron (Fe) as a redox promoter to convert polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE) into high-quality liquid fuels. Proximate analysis confirmed the high volatility of the plastics and the dual role of LRC as both a microwave susceptor and carbon co-reactant. Systematic variation of microwave power (300–800 W) and residence time (30–180 min) revealed that higher powers enhanced oil yield, with reactivity following the order PS > PP > PE. The Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst delivered the most significant improvements, reducing density and viscosity while increasing °API gravity (>35) and calorific value (>50 MJ/kg), thereby meeting or surpassing conventional light fuel specifications. GC–MS and FTIR analyses confirmed distinct product distributions: PS-derived oils rich in aromatics, PE dominated by linear alkanes/olefins, and PP producing mixed hydrocarbons, with very low oxygenated species. The synergistic interplay of LRC for rapid heating, HZSM-5 for catalytic cracking, and Fe for dehydrogenation/aromatization enabled the selective production of light hydrocarbons. Collectively, the findings establish the Fe/LRC/HZSM-5 system as a technically viable and energy-efficient platform for valorizing segregated plastic waste streams into petroleum-like fuels.

Waste PMMA pellets were provided in the form of post-industrial recycled (PIR) PMMA. Three types of zeolite catalysts such as HY, H-zeolite socony mobil-5 (HZSM-5), and H-mobil composition of matter-22 (HMCM-22) were tested to assess their catalytic performance for retrieval under plasma irradiation.

Therefore, minimizing pollution due to such waste requires sustainable, modern, eco-friendly, and economical recycling technology and the upgrading of existing recycling technology.

A small sample (<0.1g) was clamped between two meshes that were heated fast (up to 10000°C/s, ΔT mesh ±35°C) by an electrical current. The mesh/feedstock was placed inside a vacumized (P <0.3mbar), liquid nitrogen cooled vessel (T wall <−80°C).

Reproducible results concerning yields (mass balance closures 90–110wt%) and analysis were obtained (oil by SEC and NMR, gas by GC, char by FTIR).

The catalytic treatment was applied to the pyrolysis vapors that were driven across a H-ZSM-5 catalyst bed before their condensation into liquid products. Increasing the PA6 concentration in the BW+PA6 blends led to an increase in the average molar mass of bio-oils and to an increase in their N-content. Caprolactam and 5-cyano-1-pentene were the main products derived from PA6 pyrolysis, and their ratio also changed with the PA6 concentration. The production of fully deoxygenated compounds was strongly reduced in the presence of PA6, as the result of catalyst deactivation, also evidenced by the increase in sugars and decrease in furans concentrations. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst decreased as the PA6 concentration increased, but this coke contained more nitrogen.

Abstract: To valorize plastic wastes, pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was conducted as a case study. In an effort to build the more sustainable pyrolysis platform for PVC, CO2 was particularly employed as a reactive gas medium, and magnetite (Fe3O4) was used to explore the feasibility of enhancing CO2-assisted PVC pyrolysis. The favorable effect of Fe3O4 on syngas generation from pyrolysis of PVC was apparent to yield highest concentration of H2 (0.28 mol% at 590 °C) and CO (4.34 mol% at 800 °C) in the presence of 0.1 g Fe3O4/1 g PVC. The GC-TOF analysis of tar generated from thermal decomposition of PVC evidenced more breakdown of PVC hydrocarbons in the presence of Fe3O4, which led to the enhanced production of syngas. In the presence of 0.01 g Fe3O4, the evolution of CO was observed at lower temperature (7.1 mol% at 680 °C) than the case without Fe3O4, and further addition of Fe3O4 up to 0.5 g gradually increased the CO level in the latter stage of pyrolysis (up to 4.5 mol% at 900 °C), which is attributed to the enhanced Boudouard reaction. Good adsorption ability of biochar products was also demonstrated in the removal of methylene blue. Collectively, the use of Fe3O4 in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of plastics could open the possibility of utilizing waste plastics in thermo-chemical process for energy recovery and environmental application.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on syngas production and catalyst-enhanced Boudouard reaction, with minimal emphasis on oil composition or liquid product fingerprinting.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;TARGET_AROMATICS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The expansion of the human population, urbanization, environmental damage, and energy demand have depleted the fossil fuel supply. As a result, the primary problems of the current global socioeconomic restructuring require substantial and long-term alternative energy resources. This study studies the synergistic potential of co-pyrolysis, a promising thermochemical conversion process, to produce hydrocarbon-rich fuel from a blend of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and rice husk biomass. The thermal behavior of the blended feedstock at different weight ratios was investigated using TGA. For pyrolysis experiments, several mixes of waste plastics (80, 60, and 50 wt%) were combined with biomass and pyrolyzed in a semi-batch reactor under optimal conditions (550 °C temperature, 10 °C/min heating rate, and 200 mL/min N2 flow rate). The fuel characteristics of co-pyrolyzed fuel were assessed using ASTM techniques. The physicochemical parameters of the co-pyrolyzed fuel were characterized using experimental investigations, which included its energy content, elemental composition, density, viscosity, and stability. The results show that pyrolyzing LDPE and rice husk together produces a hydrocarbon-rich fuel with good combustion properties. The fuel has higher energy content and lower viscosity than individual feedstocks, making it a feasible alternative to traditional petroleum-based fuels. FTIR and NMR investigations indicated the presence of a variety of functional groups, most notably aromatic compounds, acids, phenols, water, esters, and ethers. Furthermore, NMR study indicated that adding waste plastics enhances aromatic content while decreasing paraffinic chemicals.

Abstract: The direct pyrolysis of waste printed circuit board (WPCB) produces metal-enriched char, while its polymer fraction converts to valuable gas and liquid fractions. However, the low amount of organic fraction produces less liquid yield. Thus, the current study is focused on optimizing the pyrolysis parameters (temperature, heating rate, and hold time) towards maximum liquid and minimum solid (char) yields using response surface methodology (RSM). The purpose of the objective functions is to completely remove the organic material and convert most of it to liquid fraction while producing metal-enriched char. The RSM study was employed using a face-centered central composite design (CCD). The responses were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the quadratic model was found to be the best-fit model. The ‘temperature’ was found to be the most significant parameter. Hence, further experiments were conducted by varying the temperature, keeping the heating rate and hold time constant, and the obtained products were subjected to detailed characterization.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis offers an efficient pathway for transforming plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or chemicals through directional regulation, mitigating plastic pollution, and achieving high-value utilization of plastic. This study introduces a novel in-situ catalytic pyrolysis approach utilizing a rotary kiln system integrated with a solid heat carrier and Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, aimed at improving benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) yields while simultaneously generating hydrogen as a by-product. The effects of Ni loading (0–20 wt%) on ZSM-5 and catalyst-to-plastic mass ratios (Cat:MP = 0.5–2) on product distribution were systematically investigated. Additionally, thermodynamic efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the process were comprehensively evaluated through integrated exergy analysis and exergoeconomic assessment. The results demonstrated that Ni modification significantly improved BTX selectivity, with 10Ni/ZSM-5 achieving a peak BTX content of 52.4 % in pyrolysis oil, while 20Ni/ZSM-5 enhanced hydrogen yield to 45.1 vol%.

Abstract: The deactivation process of HZSM5 zeolite during the catalytic degradation of LDPE and HDPE has been studied by repeated batch operation using the same sample of catalyst in consecutive cycles until almost a total loss in the activity of the catalyst was observed. The gaseous and condensed products generated in each cycle were analysed as well as the coked catalyst obtained. They were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and thermogravimetric analysis. The deactivation process of HZSM5 depends on the type of polyethylene used. With LDPE the zeolite showed a slow deactivation. In the first four consecutive cycles the coke deposit increased, significantly changing the properties of the catalyst although the yield of gaseous and condensed products remained nearly constant throughout. From the fifth cycle on no more coke was deposited on the catalyst but the composition of products changed progressively, tending to that obtained in a thermal process. This behaviour could be related to the change in coke composition because of the effect of the temperature and the time.

As a widely accepted way to dispose of municipal solid waste, pyrolysis was chosen for this study. The pyrolysis experiments of PVC, BC, and their mixture were conducted to characterize PVC artificial leather’s pyrolysis behavior and product characteristics. TG-FTIR and kinetics analysis showed the strong synergistic effect between PVC and cellulose in BC occurred at 240 °C – 314 °C, resulting in cellulose dehydration and aromatization. An exceptionally high tar yield of 54.96 wt% was obtained by fast pyrolysis of the mixture at 500 °C. GC–MS analysis of tar proved BC consisted of cellulose, PET, and PA. The high tar yield of co-pyrolysis came from the synergistic effects of PVC on cellulose and PET, both of which formed terephthalic acid, di(2-chloroethyl) ester (TADE).

Abstract: Introducing intracrystalline mesoporosity to zeolites is an effective way to reduce their diffusion limitations and enhancing their catalytic performance in reactions where large molecules are involved. The emergence of the so-called surfactant-templating technique has enriched the toolbox of methods to prepare mesoporous zeolites, in which amphiphilic molecules are used to assist in and direct the generation of mesopores in a pre-existing zeolite structure under alkaline conditions. We herein present ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite, which is achieved in just a few minutes with a tubular reactor that features fast heating. Two *BEA zeolites of the same Si/Al ratio, but differing in crystal size, are employed to demonstrate the concept. Tuning the interplay between the surfactant concentration and the alkalinity leads to the ultrafast generation of mesoporosity in the *BEA zeolite with the larger crystal size (BEA (L)) in 5 min; while it fails to generate uniform mesopores to the *BEA zeolite with the smaller crystal size (BEA (S)) under otherwise identical conditions. The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA (S) is achieved only when it is partially dealuminated through a pre-treatment with acid. Our results provide new insights on the synergetic effect between the surfactant and the base that governs the surfactant-templating process and on how to produce intracrystalline mesoporosity with narrow pore size distribution under ultrafast conditions (2 min). The resultant mesoporous *BEA zeolites have been tested in the catalytic cracking of the vapours produced by pyrolyzing low-density polyethylene, a promising reaction for converting waste plastics into fuels. Improved selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons and light olefins is observed as a result of enhanced accessibility and availability of active sites, validating the superiority of the surfactant-templated *BEA zeolites.",YES,NO,Catalyst mechanism-focused study with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: In this work, the morphological characteristics of waste polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) plastics during their pyrolysis process were investigated, and based on their basic image changing patterns representative morphological signals describing the pyrolysis stages were obtained. PE and PP granules and films were used as typical plastics for testing, and influence of impurities was also investigated. During pyrolysis experiments, photographs of the testing samples were taken sequentially with a high-speed infrared camera, and the quantitative parameters that describe the morphological characteristics of these photographs were explored using the “Image Pro Plus (v6.3)” digital image processing software. The experimental results showed that plastics pyrolysis involved four stages: melting, two stages of decomposition which are characterized with bubble formation caused by volatile evaporating, and ash deposition; and each stage was characterized with its own phase changing behaviors and morphological features. Two stages of decomposition are the key step of pyrolysis since they took up half or more of the reaction time; melting step consumed another half of reaction time in experiments when raw materials were heated up from ambient temperatures; and coke-like deposition appeared as a result of decomposition completion. Two morphological signals defined from digital image processing, namely, pixel area of the interested reaction region and bubble ratio (BR) caused by volatile evaporating were found to change regularly with pyrolysis stages. In particular, for all experimental scenarios with plastics films and granules, the BR curves always exhibited a slowly drop as melting started and then a sharp increase followed by a deep decrease corresponding to the first stage of intense decomposition, afterwards a second increase – drop section corresponding to the second stage of decomposition appeared. As ash deposition happened, the BR dropped to zero or very low values. When impurities were involved, the shape of BR curves showed that intense decomposition started earlier but morphological characteristics remained the same. In addition, compared to parameters such as pressure, the BR reflects reaction stages better and its change with pyrolysis process of PE/PP plastics with or without impurities was more intrinsically process correlated; therefore it can be adopted as a signal for pyrolysis process characterization, as well as offering guide to process improvement and reactor design.",YES,NO,The study focuses on morphological changes and image-based signals during pyrolysis without reporting any quantitative oil composition or yield data.,NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

A comparative pyrolysis of usual Ground Tire Rubber (GTR) and a commercial devulcanized ground tire rubber, (known as Reclaim Rubber-RR) is performed in a static-bed batch reactor at 400–600°C and the oil is distillated to light and heavy fractions. Chemical composition studies show higher amounts of aromatics in HFPO than light fraction. As a novel approach, a relationship between isotherm at max temperature and pyrolysis temperature is presented in this work. Pyrolysis time for RR is approximately half of GTR at same temperatures due to RR devulcanized nature. The solid yield is larger for GTR than RR and decreases by temperature. The liquid yield for RR is larger than GTR. Pyrolysis time and liquid yields of GTR and RR approach to each other at higher temperatures.

Despite a decrease in gas yield to 13.7 wt% as the temperature increases, the hydrogen yield significantly increased up to 11.0 wt% from 900 °C to 1600 °C. Approximately two-thirds of the hydrogen present in the polymer was identified as molecular hydrogen in the product gas. At 1600 °C, a purity of 98.5 mol% was achieved for the hydrogen produced, while the product gas at temperatures ranging from 700 °C to 900 °C predominantly contained methane and ethylene. The analysis of the influence of temperature on the condensable product phase demonstrated an increase in the yields of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) species up to a temperature of 1000 °C. The decrease in yield of Aliphatic and PAHs from 1000 °C onwards could be attributed to the gradual decarbonization of the gas phase through the formation of solid carbon. Additionally, the produced solid carbon was analyzed using various techniques, including TEM, SEM, DLS, TGA, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated its potential as a sustainable industrial carbon material.",YES,NO,"Main target is hydrogen production with minimal focus on oil composition, and the liquid product is not a central focus of the study.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Automotive shredder residue (ASR) can create difficulties when managing, with its production increasing. It is made of different type of plastics, foams, elastomers, wood, glasses and textiles. For this reason, it is complicated to dispose of in a cost effective way, while also respecting the stringent environmental restrictions. Among thermal treatments, pyrolysis seems to offer an environmentally attractive method for the treatment of ASR; it also allows for the recovery of valuable secondary materials/fuels such as pyrolysis oils, chars, and gas. While, there is a great deal of significant research on ASR pyrolysis, the literature on higher scale pyrolysis experiments is limited. To improve current literature, the aim of the study was to investigate the pyrolysis of ASR in a bench scale rotary kiln. The Italian ASR was separated by dry-sieving into two particle size fractions: d30mm. Both the streams were grounded, pelletized and then pyrolyzed in a continuous bench scale rotary kiln at 450, 550 and 650°C. The mass flow rate of the ASR pellets was 200–350g/h and each test ran for about 4–5h. The produced char, pyrolysis oil and syngas were quantified to determine product distribution. They were thoroughly analyzed with regard to their chemical and physical properties. The results show how higher temperatures increase the pyrolysis gas yield (44wt% at 650°C) as well as its heating value. The low heating value (LHV) of syngas ranges between 18 and 26MJ/Nm3 dry. The highest pyrolysis oil yield (33wt.%) was observed at 550°C and its LHV ranges between 12.5 and 14.5MJ/kg. Furthermore, only two out of the six produced chars respect the LHV limit set by the Italian environmental regulations for landfilling.

Abstract: Polypropylene (PP) was pyrolysed over various catalysts using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolite catalysts (HZSM-5>HUSY≈HMOR) was higher than that for non-zeolite catalysts (SAHA≈MCM-41). Product distributions with HZSM-5 contained more olefinic materials with about 60wt% in the range of C3–C5. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffin streams with large amounts of isobutane (i-C4) and both catalysts were deactivated during the course of the degradation. SAHA and MCM-41 showed the lowest conversion and generated an olefin-rich product with a rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. Experiments carried out with various catalysts gave good yields of volatile hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reactor conditions; in particular, olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times.

Abstract: In this work, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and paper mill sludge (PMS) were co-pyrolyzed under two environments of N2 and CO2. The pyrolysis process was assessed by conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and monitoring the evolution of gaseous products. The resulting solid composites were characterized using XRD, XPS, BET, and Raman analyzers, and their ability to catalytically activate persulfate (S2O8 2−) was tested by conducting methyl orange (MO) degradation experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC and PMS at the same mass ratio (1:1) in CO2 resulted in the highest production of H2 and CO (0.36 mol % H2 at 480 °C & 1.53 mol % CO at 700 °C).

Abstract: This study engineered seabed sediment with microwave-assisted Ni2+-substitution to enhance its composition and properties.

The characterization reveals microwave irradiation synergistically modifies the physical properties (increasing functional groups, reducing crystallinity) and electronic properties (modulating bandgap energy, increasing electron density) of the Mwx%Ni-SB, thereby improving methane reforming performance. Microwave treatment compresses and rearranges Ni2+ ions within the sediment lattice, resulting in increased order and density, and creating defects that enhance catalytic activity. GC-TCD analysis demonstrates that the use of catalysts in the first and second stages more than doubled hydrogen production (109.74 %) compared to not using catalysts.

Abstract: Waste enameled copper wire is an important secondary source of copper and often recovered by removing their organic paint layer through pyrolysis. This research focused on studying co-pyrolysis behaviors of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) paint of waste enameled wires, mixed with a small amount of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is part of electric wires or cables. The results indicated that mixing PVC with a mass fraction of 10% into enameled PET wire paint (EPET) would significantly affect pyrolysis products, especially the chlorinated compounds, as well as increase energy consumption of the pyrolysis process. TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS analyses showed that the chlorinated organics were mainly generated in the second stage of pyrolysis. Chloroesters such as terephthalic acid, di(2-chloroethyl) ester were dominant over other chloroorganic compounds, and their formations were attributed to the addition reaction of aromatic vinyl esters with HCl which formed from PVC pyrolysis. It is also worth mentioning that the chemically active acid chlorides including propanoyl chloride and benzoyl chloride were detected in the products, and they were proposed to be formed from the HCl acidolysis of esters that produced from pyrolytic EPET. Besides pyrolysis products, energy consumption of pyrolysis process also was closely correlated to the interactions between pyrolytic PVC and EPET. The average co-pyrolysis activation energy was calculated by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and was about 15 kJ/mol higher than that of EPET. These should be consequences of reactions between HCl and EPET. Since PVC is the minority component in the pyrolysis mixture that HCl eliminated from the few PVC was mostly consumed by EPET to form chloroorganic compounds, which negatively influences EPET degradation.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis of PET and PVC with no focus on oil composition and primary emphasis on chlorinated byproduct formation and reaction mechanisms.,CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS

Abstract: Vacuum pyrolysis of individual plastics including high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) has been performed at a final temperature of 500°C and under a total pressure of 2 kPa. A PVC sample and a commingled plastic sample composed of HDPE/LDPE/PP/PS/PVC have been pyrolyzed in two consecutive steps at 360 and 520°C in order to separately trap HCl. A pyrolysis set-up consisting of a bench scale batch reactor with a condensation train was used to collect the pyrolysis products. The main gaseous and liquid products, including the chlorinated hydrocarbons, were identified by chromatography. Global and chlorine mass balances were performed. The yields and pyrolysis product composition from each single polymer were compared with those from the commingled plastics. At 520°C, 99.55 wt.% of the total chlorine was trapped as HCl corresponding to 4.6 wt.% in yield, on an original feedstock basis, followed by 62.0 wt.% wax, 31.1 wt.% oil, 1.0 wt.% gas and 1.2 wt.% solid char residue (loss was 0.1 wt.%).

Abstract: In this study, thermo-chemical decomposition of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) from municipal solid waste pre-treatment plant has been conducted in pyrolytic conditions. Due to high heterogeneity, individual RDF samples are not necessarily representative of the full variety of different components present. To overcome this, five different samples of RDF with varying compositions were treated in a rotary kiln reactor. RDF feed has been characterized based on the amount of biomass and plastic content. Product (oil & char) composition and quality were analysed using different characterization techniques. It was observed that the quality of pyrolysis products varied with the feed composition and operating temperature. Maximum oil yield of oil ∼43% was obtained from RDF containing ∼77% of plastics at 500 °C. This study showed that the interaction of RDF components has a major role in the pyrolysis oil composition. The oil phase mainly consisted of n-aliphatic, branched aliphatic compounds and primary alcohols while, the aqueous phase consisted of organic acids, furans, methanol, phenols, and their derivatives along with ketones. At higher temperatures, the phenolic compounds decreased and the alcohol content was found to increase. Using solvent extraction, phenolic compounds were extracted with hexane while, ketones and acids were extracted using acetone. With high plastic content (∼85%), the char yield reduced from 55% to 30% with increase in temperature.

Abstract: In this work, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are synthesised from waste polymer (polystyrene) using alumina-supported single and bimetallic catalysts in a two-stage reactor. Waste polystyrene was efficiently converted into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a two-step pyrolysis-decomposition method. The sol-gel method was used to synthesize a series of single metallic (Ni, Fe, and Co) and bimetallic catalysts, Fe:Ni, Co:Ni, and Fe:Co, with active metals in the ratios 1:3, 3:1, and 1:1. Mo served as the promoter, and Al2O3 as the catalyst support. Catalyst characterization techniques such as BET analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed. The catalytic activity of each synthesised catalyst was evaluated based on the yield and quality of the resulting MWCNTs. With better graphitization and fewer structural flaws, Ni/Mo/Al₂O₃ showed the highest quality of MWCNTs produced among all catalysts. Due to its high surface area, mesoporosity, and efficient metal dispersion, the Ni/Mo/Al₂O₃ catalyst demonstrated the highest performance, generating uniform, fine-diameter MWCNTs (20–40 nm) with high yield (65 %), outstanding graphitization (lowest ID/IG ratio of 0.55), and superior crystallinity. The crystalline nature of the CNTs was validated by structural investigation using XRD, with diffraction peaks corresponding to graphite (002) and (100) reflections. Lower ID/IG ratios in MWCNTs using single-metal catalysts, Ni and Fe based catalysts, suggested greater graphitization and fewer defects, but bimetallic catalysts showed larger defect density, according to Raman spectroscopy, which shed light on structural quality. Polycrystalline structures with well-ordered graphene layers were revealed by Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns, confirming the synthesised CNTs' are graphitic origin.

Abstract: The co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) offers a novel strategy for the selective conversion of waste plastics into high-value olefins.This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics, kinetic parameter calculations, synergistic interactions, and product distributions of HDPE/LDPE mixtures at ratios of 1:1 (HL11), 1:3 (HL13), and 3:1 (HL31), and reveals the underlying mechanism by which synergistic effects govern product selectivity during co-pyrolysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the HDPE/LDPE mixture with a 3:1 ratio (HL31) exhibits the most significant synergistic enhancement. The co-pyrolysis of HL31 shows the lowest activation energy (212.44 kJ mol−1), consistent with the random nucleation and growth model (A 3/2 ). Product analysis further reveals that the HL31 pyrolysis achieves an oil yield as high as 85 %.

Abstract: Biodegradable plastics are increasingly utilized due to environmental concerns but are typically disposed of together with conventional plastics.

In this study, high-value chemicals were produced from a mixture of polyolefins and biodegradable polylactide by single and stepwise pyrolysis processes. The pyrolysis of polyolefins yielded fuel-like hydrocarbons, and the pyrolysis of polylactide yielded lactide and lactic acid. In the stepwise process, oxygenated compounds were only produced in the low-temperature step, and fuel-like hydrocarbons produced in the high-temperature step were not contaminated by oxygenated compounds. The influence of different catalysts on yields was investigated in the single-step and stepwise processes. The yield and selectivity of each product were significantly influenced by the type of catalyst and the composition of the plastic feedstock.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a clean and efficient resource recovery pathway of waste polymers. However, the interaction mechanism between typical components is unclear during pyrolysis process.

Results showed that the thermal decomposition was promoted when the temperature was 340 °C, especially at 400 °C. The synergistic effect was enhanced by the increasing of PVC during first stage co-pyrolysis (300 °C). Gas yield decreased by 12.7–72.4 %, mainly due to the adsorption of chlorine (21.9–51.0 %) into char. Tar yields (7.5–9.5 wt%) were improved by 38.5–63.6 %. The content of aliphatic carbon in char (22.88 % PVC) increased by 62.1 %. In addition, the distribution of sulfur in the char was reduced from 86.6 % to 43.1 %. This was mainly due to the free radicals from PVC, which promoted the breaking of C-S in WR and increased hydrogen sulfide. For the second stage of co-pyrolysis (400 °C), the inhibitory effect was similarly enhanced with PVC proportion. Tar yields (37.9–41.4 wt%) were decreased by 0.4–20.1 %. Char yields (28.1–61.5 wt%) increased by 0.4–14.5 %. The aromatic carbon content in char increased from 18.6 % (300 °C) to 70.3 %. This was mainly due to polycondensation and melt-coating of the PVC.

Whereas, the AC catalysts activated by H3PO4 exhibited additional mesoporous properties and P-containing functional groups, providing adequate space and reactive sites for converting bulky co-pyrolytic intermediates into double-ring aromatics, which were accompanied by the release of hydrogen (up to 80.6 vol%).

Abstract: Sustainable plastic waste management in the prevailing ‘new-normal’ post-pandemic scenario calls for calorific waste plastic up-cycling into high-end product recovery pathways. The present work employed a novel dual-stage arc plasma pyrolysis reactor to recover syngas and slag products from mixed plastics and Low-Density Polyethylene and Polyethylene Terephthalate (LDPE-PET) plastic waste feeds. Syngas product yield decreased while the solid slag yield increased with rising arc current, attaining 75% and 25% for mixed plastic waste feed and 59% and 41% for LDPE-PET wastes, respectively, at 200A arc current. The resultant syngas composition showed 83% and 77% H2 while 1.7% and 2.7% CO for mixed plastic waste-feed and LDPE-PET wastes, respectively, with no significant presence of CO2. Slag characterization studies revealed the presence of scattered pores on the slag surface, graphitic nanostructures due to scraped carbon depositions from electrode tips and the absence of aromatic groups due to complete conversion. High carbon content was observed in the slag due to the dissociation of lighter hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide on dual-arc exposure in two stages, underscoring the higher efficiency.

Abstract: The evolution of char resulting from the co-pyrolysis of recycled plastic and discard fine coal, along with the impact of varying plastic additions on the characteristics of the formed char and its subsequent gasification reactivity, remains unexplored. In this study, extrudates were produced using discarded South African Highveld coal fines, combined with either recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or polypropylene (PP), respectively, and charred under a nitrogen atmosphere at three different temperatures (520, 720, and 920 °C). Co-gasification of plastic and coal provides an opportunity to reduce two waste streams simultaneously. The characteristics of the chars produced from the coal fines were compared to those produced from the extrudates formulated at varying plastic content (10, 25 and 50 %wt), using petrographic carbon form analysis, surface area and porosity analysis, as well as XRD carbon crystallite analysis. Thermal fragmentation was observed to degrade the integrity of the extrudates when the plastic content exceeded 10 %, therefore, the chars produced at 920 °C were pulverized (75–150 μm) before undergoing CO2 gasification at 800, 825 and 850 °C in the chemical-controlled regime. Carbon crystalline analyses showed that the chars were more ordered with an increase in plastic content. However, even with the more ordered structure, the gasification reactivity increased similarly with an increase in plastic content for both the extrudate derived chars containing LDPE and PP. Petrographic carbon form analysis showed an increase in crack and pore formation with an increase in plastic addition during all stages of the chars’ evolution as the pyrolysis temperature increased. The VRM time factor showed a positive linear correlation with an increase in BET surface area, especially for the LDPE derived chars (R2 > 0.7720). Therefore, the observed reactivity increase with an increase in plastic content can be correlated to an increase in surface area.

Abstract: This study aimed to establish primary reactions and identify gaseous products during fast pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). Fast pyrolysis was performed by using Py-GC/MS/FID at 574 ± 22 °C for 5 s. Gaseous fractions formed during pyrolysis of LDPE, PP and PS were 14 ± 1 wt%, 31 ± 3 wt% and 103 ± 12 wt%, respectively. The main gaseous compounds from LDPE were butane, 1-pentane and 1-hexene. PP pyrolysis gave propene, pentane and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene as the main gaseous compounds. Styrene monomer was the dominant gas from PS. The results showed that polyolefin (PP and PE) produced aliphatic hydrocarbons, while PS formed aromatic hydrocarbons.

Abstract: Waste toner powder is one of the main types of electronic waste, causing serious health and environmental problems challenges. A large portion of waste toner isn’t recycled and is instead dumped in landfills due to limitations in recycling technologies. Pyrolysis is an important method used to convert different types of wastes into valuable products, primarily bio-oil. This study investigates the potential of pyrolysis as a recycling option for WTP, a process not previously investigated in detail. Firstly, the degradation and kinetics of waste toner powder were evaluated. Secondly, the pyrolysis of waste toner powder was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at different temperatures ranging from 450 °C to 650 °C, and the ultimate analysis of the produced bio-oil and biochar was presented. Thirdly, the potential of using biochar as a catalyst in biomass pyrolysis was investigated. The kinetic parameters, mainly the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, and the thermodynamic parameters were estimated. The obtained results showed that the average value of activation energy ranged from 152.2 to 152.8 kJ/mol. The pyrolysis experiments revealed that increasing temperature increased bio-oil yield by 27 %. The ultimate analysis of the produced bio-oil indicated high carbon and hydrogen contents of 75.68 % and 8.165 %, respectively, with a higher heating value of 37 MJ/kg. The XRF analysis indicated that the waste toner powder biochar contains a higher iron oxide content of 81.15 %, which improves its catalyst characteristics, thus it was used as in the pyrolysis of the doum shell. Using biochar, a catalyst in the pyrolysis of doum shell waste increased the bio-oil yield from 20 % to 40 %, representing a remarkable improvement of 100 %.

Abstract: Continuous generation of plastic waste has prompted substantial research efforts in its utilization as a feedstock for energy generation. Pyrolysis has emerged as one of the best waste management technique for energy extraction from the plastic waste. The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of operating temperature on the liquid product yields in the pyrolysis process by non-isothermal heating. Non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) [high density polyethylene (HDPE)], waste polypropene (PP), waste polystyrene (PS), waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and mixed plastic waste (MPW) was carried out in a non-sweeping atmosphere in a semi-batch reactor at four different temperatures 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C. The minimum degradation temperature of the mixed and individual plastics was obtained using a thermogravimetric apparatus (TGA) at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The TGA results show that all plastics degrade in a single step and the degradation temperatures of PS > PET > PP > HDPE, while mixed plastic degradation indicates two distinct degradation steps. Further, a waste polymer shows a lower degradation temperature than the virgin polymer. The degradation of HDPE is found to produce the maximum oil yield with minimum solid residue. The degradation of PET results in the highest amount of solid and benzoic acid as crystals and gas with no oil. Degradation of mixed plastic causes oil yield in the intermediate range of pyrolysis of individual plastic wastes. Overall, 500 °C is observed to be an optimum temperature for the recovery of low-density pyrolytic oil with the highest liquid yield. The degradation of PE and PP is found to be caused by random chain scission followed by inter and intramolecular hydrogen transfer. The degradation of PS occurs by side elimination or end chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The degradation of mix plastics results from random chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism.

Abstract: Waste battery separators typically feature a ""sandwich"" structure made of plastic substrates and Al2O3 layers, which are stable and difficult to degrade or recycle. To address this, a novel method was developed for the directional degradation and high-value conversion of waste plastics, combining alkaline pretreatment with catalytic pyrolysis, promoting the efficient and valuable recycling of waste battery separators. Specifically, alkaline washing was applied for the pretreatment of the Al2O3-layered separators to control the limited removal of the Al2O3 layer. Aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) were subsequently produced by pyrolysis using a HZSM-5 catalyst. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for the systematical evaluation of the effects of pretreatment and pyrolysis conditions on AHs production. The findings demonstrated the limited removal of the compact Al2O3 layer through alkaline pretreatment enhanced the synergistic catalytic effect of Al2O3 and HZSM-5. This not only promoted the release of volatile components and their decomposition into more light olefins catalyzed by Al2O3, but also enhanced the subsequent conversion of light olefins into AHs catalyzed by HZSM-5. Optimal conditions included a 0.050 mol/L NaOH concentration, a 650°C-pyrolysis temperature and a catalyst/sample ratio of 12, achieving an AHs yield of 89.89 wt% (on dry ash-free basis).

Abstract: In the present study, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were pyrolyzed using HZSM-5 zeolite in a tandem micro-pyrolyzer to investigate the effects of plastic type, catalyst and feedstock contact mode, as well as the type of carrier gas on product distribution. Among the four plastics, PS produced highest aromatic yields up to 85% whereas PE and PP mainly produced aliphatic hydrocarbons. In comparison to ex-situ pyrolysis, in-situ pyrolysis of the plastics produced more solid residue but also promoted the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons, except PS. For PS, ex-situ pyrolysis produced a higher yield of aromatics than in-situ pyrolysis, mostly contributed by high styrene yield. During in-situ pyrolysis, the catalyst reduced the decomposition temperatures of the plastics in the order of PE, PP, PS and PET from high to low. Hydrogen carrier gas reduced solid residue and also increased the selectivity of single ring aromatics in comparison to inert pyrolysis. Hydrogen was more beneficial to PS and PET than PE and PP in terms of reducing coke yield and increasing hydrocarbon yield.

Abstract: This paper assesses the potential of plastics valorization by pyrolysis and in line catalytic dry reforming for syngas production. Previous studies showed the suitability of a continuous process made up of a conical spouted bed reactor for fast pyrolysis and a fluidized bed reactor for catalytic steam reforming. In order to step further in the application of this technology under dry reforming conditions, equilibrium simulation was approached to analyze process performance, as the development and optimization of this technology for the production of high-quality syngas requires understanding in detail the complex influence of process parameters. Thus, this study deals with the influence of main process parameters, namely, temperature, CO2/C ratio and the type of plastic, on the process performance. Furthermore, the role played by steam co-feeding in the dry reforming in order to adjust syngas H2/CO ratio was evaluated by varying the steam/carbon ratio. The obtained results clearly show that a strict control of process conditions is required to ensure high conversion to syngas and avoid undesired reactions, such as reverse WGS.

Abstract: Pyrolysis experiments of polyvinylchloride (PVC) were performed to investigate the effects of peak temperature, holding time, and heating rate on the formation of nascent tar. The nascent tar samples were collected using a wire-mesh reactor where the secondary reactions of the evolved volatiles were minimized. The small compounds, such as benzenes and alkanes, were not detected in nascent tar in wire-mesh reactor, whose components are quite different from those of other tars in tube type reactor and vacuum reactor.

Abstract: Unproperly treated industrial waste creates serious environmental pollution that requires immediate remediation strategies. Non-woven polyester fabrics are widely used in a variety of industrial applications; thus, their debris becomes a major portion of industrial waste. To contribute to advanced industrial waste treatment processes, this study investigated catalytic thermal treatment of non-woven polyester fabric debris on a novel ultrahigh-porosity MgO material under a CO2 environment. The ultrahigh-porosity MgO was synthesized from hydromagnesite via a series of thermal reactions, having a surface area of 208.8 m2 g−1, total pore volume of 0.34 cm3 g−1, and average pore diameter of 2.37 nm. Using the MgO as the catalyst for thermolysis of non-woven polyester fabric debris in CO2 promoted thermal cracking of volatilized species evolved from the non-woven polyester fabric debris thermolysis, thereby increasing the gas product yield and decreasing the liquid product and wax yields. In addition, dehydrogenation and reverse water gas reaction was promoted by the MgO catalyst, leading to more than higher syngas production (up to 16.1 wt% syngas yield) compared to non-catalytic thermolysis (up to 8 wt% syngas yield). The selectivity toward esters was increased, while the selectivities toward benzoic and phthalic acids were decreased, most likely due to the MgO promoting decarboxylation and esterification reactions during the thermolysis. Moreover, the ultrahigh-porosity MgO catalyst was reusable for at least two consecutive cycles.

Abstract: Microwave-assisted heating plays an important role in minimizing the high energy consumption of traditional thermochemical recycling processes. Its application to plastic waste recycling routes enables a more efficient production of new renewable feedstocks for the petrochemical industry. This work presents the experimental assessment of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste recycling in a microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) fixed bed reactor and the in-depth evaluation of the obtained pyrolysis oils in comparison with conventional plastic waste pyrolysis oils. The role of main process variables (temperature, nitrogen flow rate and susceptor-to-LDPE ratio) on the pyrolysis oil yield and composition was addressed. The maximum attained oil and wax yields were of 60–75 wt%. As a general trend, the microwave-assisted process led to a distinct chemo-selectivity compared to that of traditional LDPE pyrolysis, shifting the products distribution from saturated paraffins to olefinic species and longer molecular chains. Olefins content rose from 28 % under conventional pyrolysis to 75 % under MAP. The negligible content of aromatic compounds in MAP oils offers great potential to serve as a recycled feedstock for steam crackers. These findings are ascribed to gas-phase reactions quenching due to the microwave-induced thermal gradient between the selectively heated bed and the comparatively colder surrounding atmosphere. A statistical parametric analysis and regression model have been implemented to further evaluate the impact of each variable, and mechanistic considerations were considered on the experimental microwave-induced thermal gradients and fixed bed mass and heat transfer properties.

Its regeneration by calcination in stagnant air at 550°C followed by reduction under H2 up to 550°C removed largely the coke and retrieved its activity. During the cycle of reaction–regeneration, the nickel particles fractured and moved out to the external surface forming larger size polynanocrystalline aggregates. NH3 TPD proved that the total acidity of the catalyst increased slightly after the regeneration treatment. No collapse of the structure of the Beta structure was appreciated although some changes of the textural properties of the catalyst were observed after the regeneration treatment. The hydroreforming tests pointed out that, after the regeneration, the hydrocracking augmented originating lighter products (gases and gasolines), due to the stronger acidity. The olefins were largely hydrogenated (>90%) while the amount of aromatics and isoparaffins decreased, likely because of the worse hydrogen transfer provoked by nickel sintering or to steric hindrances caused by the lower pore volumes detected.

Compounds with this behaviour were mainly volatile hydrocarbons, which were consumed in presence of oxygen. In addition, compounds with oxidized structure were present a maximum with oxygen ratio. Intermediate compounds with very high resistance to the oxygen under the working conditions increased continuously in concentration when the oxygen ratio increased.

SH maintained a stable relative content of MAHs in the first 40-min time on stream, which was higher than peak relative content of MAHs with the other three catalysts. This was because the mass transfer of both the reactants and products was enhanced through three-dimensional structure of SiC foam ceramic. However, due to severe acid site loss of SH, catalytic activity rapidly decreased to about 55% of the initial value in the last 20-min time on stream. After regeneration, the physicochemical properties of SH were not restored to the level of the fresh catalyst, indicating an irreversible deactivation, while irreversible deactivation rate gradually increased as 5 run-regeneration cycles proceeded.

Abstract: The co-pyrolysis of brominated high impact polystyrene (Br-HIPS) with polyolefins using a fixed bed reactor has been investigated, in particular, the effect that different types of brominated aryl compounds and antimony trioxide have on the pyrolysis products. The pyrolysis products were analysed using FT-IR, GC–FID, GC–MS, and GC–ECD. Liquid chromatography was used to separate the oils/waxes so that a more detailed analysis of the aliphatic, aromatic, and polar fractions could be carried out. It was found that interaction occurs between Br-HIPS and polyolefins during co-pyrolysis and that the presence of antimony trioxide influences the pyrolysis mass balance. Analysis of the Br-HIPS+polyolefin co-pyrolysis products showed that the presence of polyolefins led to an increase in the concentration of alkyl and vinyl mono-substituted benzene rings in the pyrolysis oil/wax resulting from Br-HIPS pyrolysis. The presence of Br-HIPS also had an impact on the oil/wax products of polyolefin pyrolysis, particularly on the polyethylene oil/wax composition which converted from being a mixture of 1-alkenes and n-alkanes to mostly n-alkanes. Antimony trioxide had very little impact on the polyolefin wax/oil composition but it did suppress the formation of styrene and alpha-methyl styrene and increase the formation of ethylbenzene and cumene during the pyrolysis of the Br-HIPS.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with polyolefins, no pure plastic-only condition reported, and focus on brominated compound interactions rather than general plastic oil fingerprints.",CO_PYROLYSIS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Fishing nets and related gear account for approximately 20% of the total plastic waste in the ocean, amounting to around 640,000 tons per year. Efforts are underway to develop circular economy strategies for the reuse and recycling of marine plastics. In this context, the present study introduces an innovative approach for developing advanced composite materials, employing recycled polyamide 6 (rPA6) derived from fishing nets and reinforced with recycled carbon fibers (rCF) recovered from epoxy resins through a novel thermo-oxidative process. The process involves pyrolysis at 510 °C in nitrogen to degrade the epoxy matrix, followed by gasification in air to produce clean rCF with enhanced adhesion to rPA6, eliminating the need for new sizing. This treatment increases the presence of polar groups on the surface of rCF compared to virgin carbon fibers (vCF), improving the O/C ratio (from 0.021 to 0.054 wt%) while maintaining their dimensions (7–8 μm) and surface smoothness, resulting in similar mechanical properties (293 ± 20 versus 282 ± 35 GPa). The improved compatibility of rCF with rPA6, compared to vCF, is demonstrated by the enhanced tensile modulus (11.1 and 13.1 GPa) and impact toughness (25.9 and 28.4 kJ/m2) observed in vCF/rPA6 and rCF/rPA6 composites, respectively, at the highest fiber loading of 15 wt%, in contrast to pure rPA6 (3.2 GPa and 11.8 kJ/m2). A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the CF-polyamide 6 composites. Three production scenarios were compared: Scenario 0 (virgin PA6 and vCF), Scenario 1 (rPA6 and vCF), and Scenario 2 (rPA6 and rCF). Scenario 2 showed the highest reduction in emissions, saving 5.74E+03 kg of CO2 equivalents.

Abstract: Plasma catalysis, as a highly promising technology for plastic upcycling, enables the efficient conversion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into oil fuels under mild conditions. For the plasma-catalytic LDPE hydrogenolysis process at an input power of ca. 56 W without external heating, the optimized 5Sm/USY catalyst exhibited the highest yield of oil fuels (83 %), with C4-C13 gasoline-range fractions accounting for up to 98 %. Compared to pure plasma condition, the incorporation of catalyst improved the discharge power and the discharge mode was transformed to surface discharge, which promoted the LDPE conversion. Notably, the plasma-catalytic system exhibited a 1.51-fold increase in C-C bond cleavage rate compared to thermal catalysis, with energy consumption being less than one-fifth of thermal catalytic processes, demonstrating its superior bond-breaking efficiency and energy-saving advantage. Mechanistic studies revealed that the plasma effectively activates LDPE molecular chains, synergizing with the shape-selective effect of porous USY zeolite. The addition of Sm2O3 species increased the content of Lewis acid sites and further promoted hydrogen ion abstraction to form carbocations.

Abstract: MgO as an alkaline catalyst offers a more economical and activity-stable option for the pyrolysis of polymers. In the present work, it was used for the microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS), representing typical aliphatic and aromatic polymeric structures, respectively, to explore the interactions between plastics, which enhance the production of high-quality liquid fuel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was employed to assess the thermodynamic and kinetic features of the pyrolysis process. Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PS without a catalyst lowered the activation energy (E) by 75.0 kJ/mol, while the addition of MgO further decreased E by 46.6 kJ/mol. Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis experiments demonstrated that non-catalytic conditions favored liquid fuel formation while suppressing gas production. With the addition of MgO, liquid yield dropped while gas yield rose. The catalytic co-pyrolysis elevated the content of C5−C12 hydrocarbons and monoaromatic hydrocarbons, with positive synergistic effect of 30.5% and 159.5%, respectively. Notably, at an LDPE/PS ratio of 1:2, the content of C5−C12 hydrocarbons reached 100%, with monoaromatic hydrocarbons accounting for 95.6%.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is an environmental technology for the proper treatment of electronic waste (e-waste) for the production of fuel. However, the presence of brominated compounds in pyrolysis oil makes its commercialization difficult. In this study, various types of zeolites, HY (30), HZSM-5 (30), HZSM-5 (50), HZSM-5 (280), and basic metal oxides (MgO and CaO) were used for the pyrolysis of flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs) for the first time to produce bromine-free oil.

Abstract: To better understand the mechanism of carbon deposition, the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) was explored over a FeNi/Al2O3 catalyst, and the evolution of volatiles as well as the yield and structure of carbon products at different temperatures were analyzed in depth by an in-situ atmospheric pressure photoionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (APPI HRMS) combined with a fixed-bed reactor. The results show that raising the pyrolysis temperature (from 500 to 800 °C) reduces carbon product yield and H2 production, and the proportion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the carbon products decreases. The source of carbon products gradually shifts from liquid-phase carbon sources to gaseous-phase carbon sources. Below 700 °C, both the outer diameter and carbon interlayer spacing of CNTs decrease, while above 700 °C, they both increase along with increased distortion of carbon layers. It is also observed that the carbon layers are connected to the catalyst lattice stripes, and the interlayer spacing of carbon layers is greater than the catalyst lattice spacing. In situ mass spectrometry reveals a significant increase in the carbon number and double bond equivalent (DBE) values of volatiles with increasing pyrolysis temperature, but the rate of increase slows down after 700 °C.

Abstract: Lignin was co-pyrolyzed with polystyrene to subject volatiles to post-plasma refining for potential aromatic production, mainly focusing on effects of blend ratio and plasma parameters. Firstly, the co-pyrolysis at equal mass ratio was beneficial for reducing residual char and reaction energy barrier. Secondly, elevating polystyrene blend ratio could improve oil yield, fuel-grade, and aromatic selectivity, but the improvement was compromised, showing volatiles synergy and plasma excitation were more favorable at a balanced ratio, because the H-donation of polystyrene and the bond-cleavage ability of lignin-derived oxyradicals were fully utilized. Thirdly, increasing plasma current enhanced plasma emission spectra, meaning more energetic reactive species, while extending discharge length had a little effect on the spectra, but doubling the discharge length had a more obvious refining effect than increasing the discharge current by equal steps. Fourthly, increased plasma parameters contributed to the breakage of bridged bonds between benzene rings and the loss of aliphatic side-chains, deepening deoxygenation, lowing molecular weight, and raising aromatic proton ratio. However, higher plasma current mainly weakened the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics, and higher discharge length severely decreased the aromatic yield.

Abstract: Carbon-based catalyst can effectively crack model waste plastic based on polyolefins under contactless induction heating and yield gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons fractions at mild reaction temperatures. High catalytic performances are reached thanks to the stable catalyst bed temperature arising from the high heating rate of the induction setup. By comparison to indirect Joule heating which required much higher temperatures, contactless direct induction heating allows a compensation of the internal temperature loss during such highly endothermic process through direct heat targeting. The single carbon-based catalyst combined a high and stable activity with an extremely high stability as a function of cycling tests with pure or mixed polymers. By comparison to the acid or metal based catalysts used in plastic cracking, such low cost carbon catalyst avoids deactivation within cycling tests and therefore provides an efficient and cost-effective route for waste plastic recycling and also as chemical storage means for renewable energy.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on catalyst performance and energy efficiency rather than detailed oil composition or plastic fingerprinting, with no mention of GC-MS or quantitative oil product characterization.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS

Abstract: The massive generation of synthetic textile waste has drawn considerable attention. Landfilling/incineration of textile waste has been widely made. To abate the environmental burdensome from the conventional management processes, a thermo-catalytic conversion was used for rapid volume reduction of textile waste and simultaneous valorization by recovering textile monomer in this study. Stockings were chosen as a model feedstock. Because stockings consisted of nylon with other contents, different products (caprolactam (nylon monomer), imines, cyclic dimers, and azepines) were recovered. The yield of caprolactam from the thermal conversion at 500 °C was 53.6 wt%. To selectively enhance the caprolactam yield, catalytic pyrolysis was done using γ-Al2O3 supported metal catalysts (Ni, Cu, Fe, or Co). γ-Al2O3 itself increased the caprolactam yield up to 69.0 wt% via a based-catalyzed reaction of nylon depolymerization and intramolecular cyclization. Under the presence of metal catalysts, the caprolactam yield increased up to 73.3 wt%. To offer desired feature of green chemistry, CO2 was adopted as reactive gas. Under the CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis, caprolactam yield was enhanced up to 77.1 wt% over Cu/Al2O3 (basis: stocking mass). Based on the net content of nylon in the stockings, the yield of caprolactam was deemed 95.3 wt%.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising technology in recycling copper from enamelled wires. Nevertheless, due to the unclear pyrolysis characteristics, the sorting of enamelled wires is deficient in the pyrolysis process. This work systematically investigated the pyrolysis characteristics of polyester enamelled wire (EPET), polyester imine enamelled wire (EPEI) and polyurethane enamelled wire (EPU). The decomposition behaviours showed that the mass loss for EPEI and EPET was around 1.9%, while it was about 1.5% for EPU. The pyrolysis temperature intervals and peaks for both EPEI and EPET appeared in the range of 320 ∼ 500 ℃ and around 420 ℃, while it was in a larger range of 228 ∼ 657 ℃ for EPU, and the peak was about 280 ℃. The average activation energies (E) calculated with Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) model demonstrated that EPEI and EPET were respectively 275.8 kJ/mol and 296.9 kJ/mol, while it was 194.2 kJ/mol for EPU. TG-FTIR results proved that the -CH, -CO, -CH2, and -OH were the main functional groups in the pyrolysis process for the three enamelled wires. Moreover, Py-GC/MS results indicated that the main pyrolysis product was benzoic acid for EPET and EPEI, while it was not observed for EPU. The pyrolysis mechanism displayed that the kinds of pyrolysis products were directly related to the connected aromatic functional group. The complicated pyrolysis products for EPU were mainly caused by the generation of isocyanate. Accordingly, EPU could be separately pyrolyzed, while EPET and EPEI were suitable for co-pyrolyzed.

Abstract: Construction waste is considered an environmental problem because its landfilling/incineration treatment methods has noticeably increased the likelihood of releasing microplastics, leachates, air pollutants, and toxic gases into the environment. Nevertheless, an environmentally benign disposal protocol for building plastic waste has yet to be fully implemented. In this study, a cleaner and safer disposal platform for building plastic waste is suggested. Specifically, the thermo-chemical treatment of building insulator waste (BIW) was conducted using CO2 as a key detoxifying agent. The BIW used in this study was composed of polyurethane foam (PUF), according to instrumental analyses. The thermal degradation of the PUF resulted in the dominant production of hazardous chemicals such as 4,4′-methylenedianiline (MDA) and its derivatives. The toxic compounds were transformed/detoxified into syngas (H2/CO) through the catalytic pyrolysis of PUF over nickel-based catalysts. Using CO2 as a detoxifying agent, MDA and its derivatives were further transformed into CO due to the homogeneous chemical reaction between CO2 and toxic compounds. 78.4 wt% of toxic compounds were converted into syngas over the CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis. Simultaneous reduction of toxic chemicals and production of value-added compounds propose that CO2 has a great potential to be used as a reaction medium to suppress toxic chemical valorization. Thus, this study experimentally confirmed the technical viability of catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 as a promising disposal platform for BIW, effectively suppressing the fate of toxic compounds.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on detoxifying toxic chemicals and producing syngas, with no reported oil composition or meaningful liquid product data.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: This study describes a novel Hybrid Microwave Plasma Enhanced Gasification (HMPEG) method for converting plastic waste into hydrogen (H2). Thermal processing of plastic waste is a low-cost method of producing H2. Current methods, however, such as pyrolysis and gasification, are limited by inefficient heating and contaminants in syngas, resulting in a low H2 yield. Our approach consists of a novel rotary pyrolysis reactor that employs an external microwave heater and an electrodeless microwave torch reformer, thereby addressing issues with current methods. In this study, pyrolysis of mixed plastic produces pyro-gas which is reformed at a temperature above 1500 °C by the steam plasma torch powered by microwave. The result is a 150 g/kg H2 yield with a 67 vol.% higher production rate, an H2/CO ratio of 7, and a conversion efficiency of 97.4%. Tar and dioxin concentrations in the syngas were found to be 0.078 g/Nm3 and 0.024 ng-TEQ/Nm3, respectively, much less than the legal limit.

Abstract: The pyrolysis products of epoxy resin consist of mixed phenolic compounds, which can be transformed into methylated phenolic compounds, pentamethylbenzene, hexamethylbenzene, and other high-value chemicals through methylation. However, the mechanism of methylation for pyrolysis products of epoxy resin remains unclear. In this study, using thermosetting epoxy resin and waste wind turbine blades as feedstocks, we investigated the methylation performance of different solid acid catalysts (γ-Al2O3, α-Al2O3, ZSM-5, MCM-41) through a pyrolysis-methylation cascade reactor. The study unveils the impact of reaction temperature and reaction time on the pyrolysis reaction and the product distribution. The optimal reaction parameters are determined to be 500 °C and a reaction time of 20 min. Under these conditions, the reforming products exhibited the highest selectivity for methylated phenolic compounds and hexamethylbenzene (42.57 wt%).

Abstract: One of the most prevalent wastes in the ocean is abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gears (ALDFGs), which poses a potential mortality risk to all marine creatures. Considering the complex compositional nature and non-biodegradability, the thermal destruction of ALDFGs could offer a strategic measure to abate all hazardous potentials triggered by ALDFGs. More specifically, it is of paramount significance to completely break down ALDFGs into the smallest molecules such as syngas (H2 and CO). Also, the conversion of ALDFGs into the smallest molecular units offer an innovative means for neutralizing toxic chemicals (that are inevitably generated from thermochemical process) given that toxicity is proportional to the degree of aromaticity/substitution of heteroatoms (S, N, Cl, etc.). To enhance the overall thermal destruction efficiency, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as a raw material. CO2 was employed as the renewable resource for carbon and oxygen to enhance syngas formation. In detail, this study experimentally proved the mechanistic contribution of CO2 to shifting carbon in wax-like/liquid hydrocarbons (HCs) into CO. The formation of CO from catalytic thermal destruction under CO2 condition was 64 times more than from thermal destruction without catalyst under CO2.

The objective of the current study was to provide thermal dependent evolution profile for mass loss and pyrolysis gas, in addition to the partial quantification of the waxy products. The polymer degradation was first characterized by thermogravimetric analysis. Many parameters were studied such as final temperature, heating rate, flow rate and the presence or not of a lid on the crucible.

Therefore, this study focussed on the segregation of plastic waste and its conversion into fuel products via pyrolysis in the temperature range of 350 – 420 °C. In a kilogram-scale pyrolysis fixed-bed batch reactor, a large quantity of condensate oil was produced with minimal amounts of non-condensable gases, chars, and waxes. Gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal gravimetric analysis were used to characterise the condensate oils. The measured fuel properties of the various condensate oil types were remarkedly similar to those of commercial fuels (gasoline, diesel, and kerosene). This makes them suitable alternatives to conventional energy sources, with the potential to significantly improve living conditions, reduce environmental pollution, and cut down on the need to import refined fossil fuel. Finally, the condensate oil from the individual plastic waste types outperformed the mixed-plastic waste in terms of fuel properties and yield.",YES,NO,"Mixed-plastic waste pyrolysis with no detailed oil composition data reported for individual plastics, limiting fingerprint utility.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The pyrolysis of plastic waste and the electrolysis of saltwater is a promising route to carbon neutrality in ocean cleanup and plastic waste management. Therefore, a solar and wind assisted H 2 -fuelled fast pyrolysis of MPW (municipal plastic waste) and electrolysis of desalinated saline were developed. The combined system uses an oxy-hydrogen furnace for thermal decomposition of MPW feed, C O 2 as an inert reaction medium and both solar and wind energy systems to operate the electrical units.

Abstract: Ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) is widely used in many industrial sectors. EPDM’s physical and chemical properties make it highly durable, flexible and resistant, while posing significant recycling challenges. The development of a circular economy for rubber compounds is a remarkable challenge for the sustainability of this industry, and pyrolysis offers interesting characteristics for the recovery of value-added raw materials from waste EPDM. This process converts EPDM rubber into raw recovered carbon black (RRCB), pyrolysis gas (PyG) and pyrolysis oil (PyO). This work studies the pyrolysis of EPDM in a lab-scale plant with two reactors in series in order to tune the yield and properties of the products to potentiate their value. While the first reactor controls the temperature effect for high quality RRCB production, the second reactor serves to thermally crack the volatiles released. The results show that the RRCB produced has a potential use as substitute for virgin carbon black (CB). Likewise, the PyO can be cracked from linear, cyclic, and heterocyclic hydrocarbon compounds to aromatic ones. In addition, PyG with high C2 and C3 gas content is highly promoted at higher cracking temperatures. This composition of PyG is seen as very promising in promoting circularity within the EPDM industry, as ethylene and propylene are the main basic chemicals for EPDM production. The developed process may serve as a promising approach to sustainable chemical recycling, balancing cost-efficiency with environmental responsibility, notably by reducing the carbon footprint through the use of RRCB as a replacement of conventional CB.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on RRCB and syngas (PyG) as primary products, with oil (PyO) being a secondary product whose composition is only briefly mentioned without detailed chemical analysis.",TARGET_CNT;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT;NO_OIL_INFO

However, when the process conditions more closely resembled to FCC conditions, the fresh commercial FCC catalyst was more favourable in terms of the yield of volatile hydrocarbon products. The degradation of HDPE over E-Cats although reduced was similar to ASA in product selectivity and yield, and the level of metal contamination did not affect the product stream generated.

Abstract: Emissions evolved from the pyrolysis and combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied at four different temperatures (500, 700, 850 and 1000°C) in a horizontal laboratory tubular quartz reactor in order to analyse the influence of both temperature and reaction atmosphere on the final products from thermal and oxidative reactions. It was observed that the CO2/CO ratio increased with temperature. Methane was the only light hydrocarbon whose yield increased with temperature up to 1000°C.

Abstract: The depolymerization of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) in supercritical methanol was investigated by using a batch autoclave reactor. Continuous kinetics analysis was applied to experimental data. It was observed that PBT could dissolve into supercritical methanol quickly and decompose completely in a homogeneous phase. PBT with average molecular weight of about 29 700 was converted to oligomer with that of 4200 within 10 min and with that of 2700 in 15 min at 513 K and converted into monomer completely within 22 min.

The yields of monomer components of the decomposition products, including byproducts were measured. The yields of DMT and BG could reach 94.5% and 70.1%, respectively, at 563 K for 75 min. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the products, a depolymerization-reaction scheme was proposed to explain the reaction mechanism, i.e. the degradation of PBT in supercritical methanol mainly includes random scission and chain-end scission reactions and side reactions for monomer components. With the process of degradation, some oligomers could be decomposed into small molecular products by side reactions.

Abstract: The abrupt rise in demand for conventional fuels has become a major cause for concern despite their increasing depletion. That's why the pyrolysis process to make plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO), can be used to prepare fuel as an alternative fuel. The batch pyrolysis reactor was fabricated to produce plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) from locally sourced grocery bags made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The purpose of this study was to thoroughly analyze the performance and emission characteristics of an engine running on up to 15 % PPO-diesel blended fuel. Then, the experimental data obtained from a single-cylinder, four-stroke engine with five distinct speeds ranging from 1000 to 3500 rpm were utilized to undertake energy, exergy, and sustainability assessments. The results showed that DPO5 had a maximum brake power of 1.92 kW at 2500 rpm. At 3500 rpm, the engine achieved a thermal efficiency of 47.44 % for diesel and 51.6 % for DPO5 blended fuel. Furthermore, DPO15 produced the least quantity of CO2 at all engine speeds. DPO5 has the highest sustainability index, 1.52 at 2500 rpm.

Abstract: The advent of COVID-19 has heightened apprehensions within the plastic waste management sector, particularly due to the increased adoption of single-use personal protective equipment (PPE)-kits at the domestic level and hospitals for protection against contagious diseases. This study addresses the issue by focusing on the hydro-processing of pyrolytic oil derived from thermally catalysed cracking of sterilized waste PPE kits. Employing an indigenously prepared FCC-supported Ni catalyst, the investigation delves into the effects of hydrogenation process parameters-temperature, catalyst composition, and catalyst loadings—maintaining a constant pressure of 70 bar H2 on fuel quality. Experimental results indicate that oil upgraded at a higher temperature of 240 °C with a 10% Ni/FCC catalyst at a 20 wt% loading demonstrates a remarkable selectivity of 76.51 wt% compounds in the C5-12 range, signifying a substantial gasoline fraction.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks can produce valuable biofuel, however, the final products may present excessive corrosion and poor stability due to the lack of hydrogen content. Co-pyrolysis with hydrogen-rich substances such as waste plastics may compensate for these shortcomings. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of a common biomass, i.e. distiller's grains (DG), and waste polypropylene plastic (PP) were investigated towards increasing the quantity and quality of the production of biofuel. Results from the thermogravimetric analyses showed that the reaction interval of individual pyrolysis of DG and PP was 124–471 °C and 260–461 °C, respectively. Conversely, an interaction effect between DG and PP was observed during co-pyrolysis, resulting in a slower rate of weight loss, a longer temperature range for the pyrolysis reaction, and an increase in the temperature difference between the evolution of products. Likewise, the Coats-Redfern model showed that the activation energies of DG, PP and an equal mixture of both were 42.90, 130.27 and 47.74 kJ mol−1, respectively. It thus follows that co-pyrolysis of DG and PP can effectively reduce the activation energy of the reaction system and promote the degree of pyrolysis. Synergistic effects essentially promoted the free radical reaction of the PP during co-pyrolysis, thereby reducing the activation energy of the process. Moreover, due to this synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis of DG and PP, the ratio of elements was effectively optimized, especially the content of oxygen-containing species was reduced, and the hydrocarbon content of products was increased. These results will not only advance our understanding of the characteristics of co-pyrolysis of DG and PP, but will also support further research toward improving an efficient co-pyrolysis reactor system and the pyrolysis process itself.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics with biomass (distiller's grains) without separate, clean plastic-only conditions or detailed oil composition data.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The increase in electronic waste, including cellular telephones, worldwide is a worrying reality. For this reason, urgent action on the management of these wastes is necessary within a framework that respects the environment and human health. Mobile phone components can be physically segregated through grinding at the dismantling sites, in order to reuse or reprocess (via chemical or physical recycling) the recovered plastics and valuable metals. A kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case has been carried out under different conditions by thermogravimetry. Several experiments were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere (pyrolysis runs) and also in an oxidative atmosphere with two different oxygen concentrations (10% and 20% oxygen in nitrogen). Dynamic runs and dynamic+isothermal runs have been carried out to obtain much decomposition data under different operating conditions. Moreover some TG–MS runs were performed in order to better understand the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case and identify some compounds emitted during the controlled heating of this material. A scheme of two independent reactions for pseudocomponents has been proposed for the pyrolysis process.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of plastics is an economical method to recover valuable fuels from waste sources.

The three operating parameters of temperature in the range of 415 to 585 ° C, feed density in a window between 959 and 967 kg/m 3 and reactor loading range from 23 to 57% were selected as the main variables. Using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) study for different heat transfer rates, the range at which the feed is fully converted was determined, thus ensuring that the correct operating temperature range was selected. By drawing difference thermogravimetry (DTG) curves and using a dynamic model, the activation energy for converting heavy and light feeds was determined to be 300.984 and 273.57 kJ/mol, respectively.

Abstract: The pyrolysis and oxidative steam reforming (P-OSR) of different types of plastics (HDPE, PP, PET and PS) has been carried out in a two reactor system provided with a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR). The effect plastic composition has on the oxidative steam reforming step has been analyzed using two space time values (3.1 gcatalyst min gplastic −1 and 12.5 gcatalyst min gplastic −1) at a reforming temperature of 700 °C, S/P ratio of 3 and ER of 0.2 (optimum conditions for autothermal reforming). The different composition of the plastics leads to differences in the yields and compositions of pyrolysis products, and consequently in the performance of the oxidative steam reforming step. High conversions (> 97 %) have been achieved by using a space time of 12.5 gcat min gplastic −1, with H2 production increasing as follows: PET ≪ PS < HDPE ≤ PP. A maximum H2 production of 25.5 wt% has been obtained by using PP, which is lower than that obtained in the process of pyrolysis and in line conventional steam reforming (P-SR) of the same feedstock (34.8 wt%). The lowest H2 production (10.5 wt%) has been achieved when PET was used due to the high oxygen content of this plastic. The results obtained in this study prove that P-OSR performs very well with different feedstock, thereby confirming the versatility and efficiency of this process to produce a hydrogen-rich gas.",YES,NO,"Main focus is hydrogen production from plastic pyrolysis, with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The role of catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) position on improved gasification of polypropylene (PP) in CO2 atmosphere using a fixed bed reactor at 900 °C was examined and the results compared with non-catalytic gasification. The catalytic gasification included in-situ and quasi-in-situ (with feedstock located close to but not directly in contact with the catalyst) configuration. Results are reported on the evolutionary behavior and yield of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), hydrocarbons (C m H n ) and total syngas. Compared to non-catalytic gasification, in-situ, and quasi-in-situ catalytic gasification produced higher H2 by 120.5% and 137.1%, higher CO by 38.2% and 24.0%, higher C m H n by 57.1% and 98.2%, and higher total syngas by 44.1% and 43.8%, respectively. CO2-assisted gasification of PP with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst significantly enhanced the gases evolution rate and improved the syngas yield.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of red oak and high density polyethylene (HDPE) was conducted in a laboratory-scale, continuous fluidized bed reactor in a temperature range from 525 to 675°C. Pyrolysis products, including two fractions of pyrolysis-oil, non-condensable gases and char were analyzed to assess the influence of pyrolysis temperature and co-feeding of biomass with HDPE. It was found that increasing pyrolysis temperature up to 625°C promoted the production of pyrolysis-oil and its yield reached 57.6wt%. Further increase in pyrolysis temperature caused the cracking of pyrolysis-oil to form light gases rich in hydrocarbons. Organic phase of pyrolysis-oil produced from plastic-biomass mixture (PBM) had a higher heating value (HHV) up to 36.6MJ/kg contributed by the additive effect of HDPE-derived aliphatic hydrocarbons. A significant synergetic effect was also observed during co-pyrolysis. Co-pyrolysis with HDPE increased the production of furan, acids and water from red oak. Co-presence of HDPE also inhibited char formation from red oak and improved the HHV of the resulting char.

Abstract: Plastics originate from the synthesis of chemical products, and the regeneration of chemical products from waste plastics through catalytic pyrolysis helps to reduce the dependence on fossil resources and improve the treatment of waste, which is an important aspect of current sustainable social development. In this study, metasequoia was used as a biomass precursor and three porous char-supported nanocatalysts (Fe-MEC, Ni-MEC, and Co-MEC) were synthesized via a simple and feasible microwave heating method, which were then used as catalysts for the preparation of high-quality liquid oil from polystyrene powder via an ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis method. The results indicate that Fe-MEC, Ni-MEC, and Co-MEC possessed good pore structures due to the microwave-heating and catalytic effect of these metals, and metal nanoparticles are generated and uniformly anchored on the matrix of the char support. Using these catalysts, the yield of liquid product from polystyrene pyrolysis decreased slightly, while the gas yield increased slightly.

Abstract: Post-consumer waste plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled represent a concerning environmental issue. According to the latest available data for Europe, as much as 25% of collected post-consumer waste plastics are landfilled, 43% is energy recovered, and 32% is recycled. One possible way of recovering non-recyclable plastics is pyrolysis, which is considered environmentally friendly technology for obtaining fuel or chemicals from plastic waste. To tackle the challenge of recovering non-recyclable plastics via pyrolysis, it is necessary to determine their actual composition. Visual separation of collected non-recyclable plastics was performed, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the accuracy of visual separation. A significant amount of plastics labelled as “other” was found. Since the composition of “other” waste plastics has not been sufficiently investigated, relatively few studies on their pyrolysis have been conducted. Therefore, they were characterised and added to the mixture with other found polymer types of non-recyclable plastics. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to determine thermochemical behaviour and kinetic parameters required for laboratory pyrolysis investigation. Kinetic analysis was conducted using the Friedman isoconversional model-free method and non-linear multivariate regression method. The goal of this paper was to analyse the kinetics, determine the product yield and characteristics of the pyrolysis process of non-recyclable plastics over zeolite catalysts. It was found how the decomposition of non-recyclable plastics occurs in two decomposition steps. The activation energy of non-recyclable plastics was 144 kJ/mol in the first stage of decomposition and 262 kJ/mol in the second stage of decomposition. It decreased by 34% and 6.5% after fresh fluid catalytic cracking catalyst was added and 41% and 18.3% with iron-modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalyst. The yield of condensate was 55% (wax) for the original sample, and it decreased to 50% (wax and oil) and 27% (mostly oil) with fresh fluid catalytic cracking and iron modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalysts.

Abstract: Background Thanks to the large-scale distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), several hundreds of millions of cases, and malaria related mortality, were averted these last decades. However, disposing of the used, and discarded nets, made of non-biodegradable plastics, and impregnated with insecticides, and usually burned or buried, raises significant, physical and chemical, environmental and health concerns. This study explores the first application of pyrolysis to recycle, and repurpose, discarded LLINs, with tests conducted in Lombok, Indonesia. Method Pyrolysis was tested on Royal Sentry® LLINs, made from polyethylene and impregnated with alpha-cypermethrin. A special equipment was prepared to make this pyrolysis, following the same protocol as the one currently used for treating plastic waste at large-scale in the factory Geo Trash Management (Lombok). Results The pyrolysis yielded 81.3 % high-quality oil, 5.65 % oil residue, and 5 % carbon residue. Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 36 hydrocarbons, 7 alcohols, and 1 acid, without harmful chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Unexpectedly, the nets contained Nonacosane, a mosquito attractant, and Citronellol, a natural repellent, raising questions about their effects on mosquito behaviour.

The results showed that the introduction of steam and the catalyst increased the yield of hydrogen. Increasing the nickel content in the catalyst also resulted in higher hydrogen yield. The comparison of the results of WEEE with those of HIPS and ABS showed that WEEE plastic was mainly composed of ABS.

Abstract: The viability of cracking low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over H-ZSM-5 catalysts at reaction temperatures below 300 °C was demonstrated using ZSM-5 catalysts with varying textual properties and acid site content. While ZSM-5 made from standard syntheses could catalyze LDPE cracking it was found that increasing the external surface area of H-ZSM-5 from 24 m2/g to 325 m2/g resulted in a dramatic increase in LDPE conversion.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of waste polymers looks an attractive way for their recycling as valuable hydrocarbons are produced that can be utilized as cleaner energy carriers or petrochemical feedstock. The lumping approach is often used to study the reaction kinetics of such complex systems as the high number of individual chemical species formed during pyrolysis and the several reactions that take place between them make the detailed kinetic modeling of the process often not feasible. Here we propose a two-step identification strategy, which requires no a priori knowledge regarding fast and slow reactions or the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients, to determine the kinetic parameters of pyrolysis and estimate product composition with the required precision using the discrete lumping method. Pyrolysis of a shredded real waste HDPE/PP/LDPE mixture was carried out previously in a laboratory scale two-stage reactor operated in batch mode. The process was investigated at different temperatures; both thermal and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis were studied, the latter on different types of zeolite-based catalysts. Our results indicate that with the suggested lumped model and kinetic identification strategy not only the experimental results can be reproduced but also the essential behavior of different catalysts can be explained. Furthermore, the two stages of the pyrolysis process have also been able to be differentiated. It can be stated that with the proper selection of pseudocomponents, the lumping approach is appropriate for catalyst evaluation and comparison as well, leading to a better understanding of the previous experimental results and the overall pyrolysis process. Hence, the results might also be used during process design or scale-up.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on kinetic modeling and catalyst evaluation using a lumping approach, with no reported detailed oil composition or extractable liquid product data.",NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Plastic is a versatile material broadly used in a variety of industries. However, the current disposal practices for plastic wastes (incineration/landfilling) add the hazardous materials into the environment. To offer a sustainable valorization platform for plastic waste, this study adopted the catalytic pyrolysis process using CO2 as a co-feedstock. A model plastic waste collected from a seaport was waste buoy (WB), which has been widely used in fishing industry. Prior to the pyrolysis tests, the exact type of plastic in WB and the thermolytic characteristics of WB were examined. Since the WB was made of polystyrene, it was mainly converted into styrene monomer (styrene), dimer (diphenyl-1-butene), and trimer (2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene) from pyrolysis of WB. To further valorize/detoxify styrene derivatives into value-added syngas, catalytic pyrolysis of WB was practiced using the Ni-based catalysts (2/5/10 wt% Ni/SiO2). The yield of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis process of WB was more than one magnitude higher comparing to that from the non-catalytic one. H2 formation also increased as catalyst loading increased. When flow gas was switched from inert gas to CO2, CO gas formation was enhanced due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and styrene derivatives over Ni catalysts. Syngas (H2/CO) formation under the CO2 condition was 5 times higher in comparison to the N2 condition in catalytic pyrolyses of WB with 10 wt% Ni/SiO2.

Abstract: Innovative and sustainable approaches are being pursued to convert plastic waste into high-value fuels, particularly without using noble metal catalysts or external hydrogen sources. In this scenario, we explored the utilization of a spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst (ECAT), aiming to enhance the yield and quality of products through catalytic cracking of Polypropylene (PP) under different reaction conditions. Under a 20 bar H2 atmosphere, ECAT efficiently cracked PP into alkanes (71.6 %) and aromatics (25.5 %), with minimal alkenes (2.2 %) production. Similarly, under a 20 bar N2 atmosphere, ECAT achieved comparable conversion levels, producing mainly saturated hydrocarbons, which was intriguing. However, tests conducted at 1 bar N2 pressure showed that PP conversion remains unaffected but presents higher olefins’ yield and lower aromatics than ECAT. Thus, pressure seems to favor aromatization and in situ hydrogen transfer. By comparing the performance of ECAT with commercial CBV 712 zeolite, we propose that PP acts as an internal hydrogen source, eliminating the need for external supply improving efficiency and selectivity. Interestingly, mechanistic insights suggested that dehydroaromatization and hydrogen transfer within zeolite pores were dominant, and pressure (H2 or N2) could have helped it. In addition, contrary to previous studies that claim that metal contaminants in ECAT are essential for the hydrogenation process, our findings suggest that for this particular ECAT composition, we do not observe any boost in alkane yield due to the presence of these metals. Hence, our study comprehensively evaluates different strategies that can be employed to promote PP upcycling promoted by ECAT.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on aromatics and alkane production under high pressure with a specific catalyst, emphasizing mechanistic insights and hydrogen transfer rather than detailed oil composition or plastic fingerprinting.",TARGET_AROMATICS;CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

The pyrolysis oils have high calorific value (between 35 and 44MJ/kg), low wt% of water (around 6wt%) and a low O/C value (between 0.2 and 0.3). The presence of waxy material is probably due to incomplete breakdown of poly(ethylene-co-propylene) present in MSW under study.

Abstract: In this study, municipal polymer wastes that were no longer recyclable and were previously buried underground according to the usual municipal waste management program were converted to liquid fuel by catalytic pyrolysis technique. In the first step, zeolite Y catalyst was used to improve the quality of liquid fuel. In the second step, MIL-53 (Cu) was incorporated onto zeolite and pyrolyzed in nitrogen in the atmosphere. The analysis shows that clusters of carbon nanopores with a copper core, and its oxides were deposited on the zeolite. For both types of catalysts, the crystallization time of zeolite was investigated, and it was found that this leads to the synthesis of samples with different percentages of crystallinity. For each test, the liquid fuel produced was divided into four cuts: gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, and wax. The test results in a fixed bed reactor for every twelve samples of catalyst and their effect on the efficiency of different sections of liquid fuel show a significant improvement in the desired product. The properties and morphology of the catalysts were investigated. It was found that at 400 °C and a crystallization time of 18 h for support with 76.62% crystallinity, gasoline production efficiency will be 37.00%. At 500 °C and low crystallinity, the tendency of reaction to produce jet fuel with a maximum efficiency of 48.64%. Furthermore, the physical properties of each cut of liquid fuel and their comparison with the reported values indicating the appropriate qualities of the produced fuel were evaluated. In the optimal state, the octane number of the produced gasoline is 93.5 and its pour point is 41 °C. Also, a jet fuel with an octane number of 43.2 and a flashpoint of 69 °C has been obtained. In the case of diesel, the octane number and its viscosity have reached 46 and 2.407 cp, respectively.

Abstract: In order to improve the quality of syngas and regulate the deposited coke, co-gasification of biomass and polyethylene wastes without and with steam were investigated in a bench-scale fixed bed reactor, where the feedstock was pyrolyzed at the temperature of 600 °C followed by catalytic reforming at 800 °C over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The influences of different biomass to plastic ratios in feedstock on the quality of gas products were analyzed by means of gas chromatography. The as-formed deposited coke was examined by TEM, Raman, FTIR and TPO analysis. The results showed a synergistic effect on both gas and tar yields when PE was co-fed to RH, especially at PE content of 50%. For higher PE content (>50%), the total gas and H2 decreased due to more chain hydrocarbons with relatively large molecular size derived from PE volatiles being more difficult to be cracked than oxygenates from pyrolysis of biomass. Two natures of the deposited coke were identified as amorphous carbon and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). With increasing PE proportion, CNTs growth exhibited a denser distribution with uniform diameter (~18 nm) and longer tube walls extending to a few microns. In the absence of steam, amorphous carbons was the leading type in coke depositions. The introduction of steam improved the quality and purity of CNTs and decreased amorphous carbon remarkably, owning to a stronger interaction between steam and amorphous carbon rather than CNTs with high graphitization, leading to high CNTs proportion of 61.5%. A significant synergistic effect on the CNT growth was observed particularly for 50–75% of PE.

Abstract: Waste activated sludge (WAS) derived from food manufacturing poses critical environmental threats, necessitating sustainable management strategies. To address the challenges associated with the high moisture and ash contents of WAS, co-pyrolysis that incorporates polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a potential solution to transform WAS into value-added bio-products. In this study, the synergistic interactions between WAS and PET during co-pyrolysis were evaluated in terms of their thermal degradation behaviors, kinetics, and evolved volatiles at different blending ratios (3:1, 1:1, 1:3). The results revealed that the addition of PET synergistically enhanced the WAS decomposition, while the degradation of PET was inhibited at a high WAS fraction. Kinetic analysis further confirmed the interactions between WAS and PET, as the activation energies became higher than the additive values when the process reached the main degradation region of PET. The favorability of co-pyrolysis was proven by the less complicated reaction models that govern the kinetics of the blends, as well as the small difference between the values of activation energy and enthalpy change (4–6 kJ/mol). Evolved gas analysis revealed that co-pyrolysis of WAS and PET may undergo a greener alternative pathway to produce aromatic-rich bio-oil with much lower carbon dioxide emissions, as compared to pyrolysis of PET alone. These findings demonstrate the advantages of co-pyrolysis over the individual pyrolysis of WAS and PET, forming the theoretical basis for the upscaling of this technology and the effective valorization of hazardous wastes.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with waste activated sludge, no pure plastic oil composition data reported.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The high calorific value, low ash content and high volatility of the plastic can compensate for the deficiencies of the single pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS), and these properties can improve the quality of the pyrolysis product. However, secondary contaminants may be generated during the co-pyrolysis of sludge and plastics. Plastics contain polluting elements that may also enter sludge, so different plastics may affect the release of N, S, and Cl as well as the ecological risk of heavy metals. In this study, polypropylene (PP), polyamide 6 (PA6) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were added to sludge to analyze the release of N, S and Cl from sludge pyrolysis products by different plastics. An environmental risk assessment was also conducted to evaluate the various forms of heavy metals. The results showed that PP, PA6, and PVC increased the total mass losses of sludge by 16.88%, 6.82% and 9.46%, respectively, inhibiting the release of NH3, CH3Cl, H2S and SO2 harmful gases from sludge. PP and PA6 increased the calorific value of pyrolysis oil and released more aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols. However, PA6 and PVC will increase the release of HCN and HCl, respectively.

Abstract: Environmental pollution and waste of resources caused by the massive accumulation and landfill of plastic waste has been prompting the research considering its reclamation. In this work, a microwave-carbon fiber cloth (CFC) co-ignited cracking strategy is proposed for highly-efficient conversion of polyethylene to hydrogen and high-quality carbon nanotubes conducted in a simple multimode microwave reactor. When FeAlOx@C is used as the catalyst, a hydrogen yield of 64.5 mmol g−1 plastic is achieved while biochar powder as the ignitor only give yield to 30.6 mmol H2 g−1 plastic, demonstrating the superiority of the CFC strategy where the carbon ignitor has little contact with the reactants. Further, FeAlOx@C treated by air plasma with rich oxygen vacancies is used as the catalyst. The yield is enhanced significantly, especially at low microwave power, resulting in a hydrogen yield of 67.3 mmol g−1 plastic at a microwave power of 900 W, which was the highest as far as we know in the literature under direct catalytic cracking processes.

Abstract: The possibilities of valorizing by pyrolysis a plastic fraction from small waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE-R4) rejected by a material recovery facility have been assessed. The characterization revealed that WEEE-R4 was mainly composed of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) and blends of polycarbonate (PC)-ABS (75 and 25 wt%, respectively) and had good physicochemical properties as feed for pyrolysis processes: high values for volatile matter (95 wt%) and low heating value (LHV, 35 MJ/kg) and low ash and moisture content (2.5 and 0.33 wt%, respectively). On the contrary, the high content of heteroatoms, in particular Br from brominated flame retardants, arose as source of concern. Thermal analysis coupled with evolved gas Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that WEEE-R4 degraded in two steps in the range 310–460 °C and mainly to the monoaromatic compounds phenol and styrene.

Abstract: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs) have gained widespread usage due to their promising physiochemical properties, while this causes large amounts of waste CFRPs worldwide. In this study, carbon fibers were successfully recovered from waste CFRPs through the pyrolysis-oxidation method, and the recovered fibers were reused in remanufacturing the secondary generation CFRPs. Moreover, the individual and interactive effects of pyrolysis-oxidation recovering parameters on the mechanical strength of the resulting remanufactured CFRPs (reCFRPs) were investigated. The recovered carbon fibers displayed surface chemical structures similar to virgin fibers but with high contents of oxygen-containing bonds. The tensile strength retention (TSR) of the reCFRPs was primarily influenced by oxidation temperature. Notably, a higher oxidation temperature, especially exceeding 560 °C, amplified the impact of oxidation duration on the TSR value. Similarly, concerning interlaminar shear strength retention (ISSR), the oxidation stage had a more substantial effect compared to the pyrolysis stage. As the oxidation temperature increased from 500 °C to 600 °C, the ISSR value initially increased and then decreased, irrespective of variations in pyrolysis parameters. Additionally, through integrating the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis and multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) global optimization, three recovery strategies, along with the corresponding processing parameters, were proposed to meet diverse requirements.

Abstract: In recent years, the production and consumption of plastics have increased significantly and wastes are commonly incinerated or dumped in a landfill. Plastics pyrolysis, on the other hand, may provide an alternative means for disposal of plastic wastes with recovery of valuable gasoline-range hydrocarbons or the monomer. Pyrolysis of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) may result in very high recycling rates (90–98%) of the monomer methylmethacrylate (MMA) since the cracking of MMA to lighter molecules (CO2, CO and light hydrocarbons) is limited. The MMA-yield is mainly dependent on the residence time of the gas in the reactor and to a lesser extent on the operating temperature. The paper presents experimental work performed in a lead bath and in a fluidised bed. At low temperatures, the reaction is kinetically controlled, whereas at high temperatures, heat transfer restricts the overall reaction rate.

Abstract: The current study deals with blending pure diesel with the liquid fuel (PB1) obtained through the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Azadirachta indica seeds and waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) as the catalyst. The maximum yield of liquid oil was obtained at 500 °C at 93.91 % while at this temperature, the yield of gases and char were observed to be the lowest compared to other temperatures. The obtained liquid oil was then characterised through FTIR and physical properties were determined for the obtained fuel and it was found that PB1 contained a higher calorific value of 44.42 MJ/kg, quite close to pure diesel. Three blends were prepared with D100 (pure diesel), namely PB1@10 (with 10 % blend), PB1@20 (with 20 % blend) and PB1@30 (30 % blend). The blends were then tested in an unmodified CI engine for a comparative analysis with respect to baseline fuel (D100).

Abstract: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising solution for reducing aviation-related carbon emissions. However, conventional SAF production methods such as waste oil aromatization face challenges like complex processing requirements and the generation of unwanted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study presents a novel, aromatization-free approach to SAF production by co-upcycling waste oils and polystyrene (PS) plastics. The inherent aromatic ring structures in PS plastics are utilized to directly form aromatic hydrocarbons, bypassing the need for traditional aromatization. A two-stage pressurized fixed-bed reactor was employed, where waste oils and PS underwent co-hydropyrolysis to generate intermediates, followed by gas-phase catalytic hydrogenation. Under optimized conditions (0.15 MPa H2, 480 °C for co-hydropyrolysis, 350 °C for hydrogenation, and 5 mg Pd/SBA-15 catalyst), this process yielded 71.0 wt% C8-C16 jet fuel components, with 84.5 % selectivity.

In this study, HDPE was pyrolyzed in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor between 500 °C and 900 °C to investigate product evolution and the carbon sphere formation mechanism. Below 800 °C, the liquid products are predominantly waxes and oils; solid carbon spheres start to be formed at 800 °C, with their yield increasing monotonically with temperature, reaching 21 wt% at 900 °C. Carbon spheres exhibit a relatively disordered internal structure, rich in defects, while higher temperatures promote the development of more ordered graphitic domains. Carbon spheres grow synergistically through aggregation and graphite growth. ReaxFF-MD simulations elucidate the molecular-scale transformation: CH bond scission generates carbon and hydrogen radicals, which repolymerize into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These PAHs then grow and coalesce through CC coupling into curved graphitic layers that nucleate carbon spheres. The study establishes a temperature-dependent growth model and offers mechanistic insight valuable for plastic recycling and the controlled pyrolytic synthesis of carbon spheres.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on carbon sphere formation with limited emphasis on oil composition, despite reporting liquid products as waxes and oils.",TARGET_CNT;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The efficient conversion of plastic waste is a critical pathway toward sustainable resource cycling. This study systematically investigates the pyrolysis mechanisms and product regulation strategies of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) using microwave-assisted Fe/FeAl₂O₄ catalytic experiments integrated with multiscale simulations, including density functional theory (DFT) and reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF). Experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in hydrogen yield through a microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, with PE achieving a hydrogen yield of 47.01 mmol/gplastic. DFT simulations reveal that strong adsorption of C₂H₄, C₃H₆, and C₈H₈ on Fe(110) surfaces promotes secondary C–H bond polarization, reducing C–H activation energy. ReaxFF simulations further show distinct bond-breaking sequences under microwave-Fe synergy: PP undergoes secondary > methyl > tertiary C–H bond cleavage, whereas PS follows aromatic > tertiary > secondary C–H bond cleavage. Notably, microwave-assisted Fe catalysis enables C–H bond activation at temperatures substantially lower than those required for C–C bond cleavage, enabling temperature-controlled preferential C–H scission to boost hydrogen selectivity while preserving carbon skeletons for high-value materials.

Abstract: Several tests using pure bottle-grade polyvinyl chlorine (PVC), with wood (pine) and with Polish coal have been performed in a two-stage combustion test facility which contains two reactors. The first reactor is a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) where the fuel is pyrolysed in the temperature range 200–400 °C. The second reactor is a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) operated at a temperature of around 800 °C. The pyrolysed gases from the BFB reactor or the circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC) are analysed with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The main part of this work concentrates on the first stage of decomposition of PVC in the first reactor, which mainly yields volatiles (mainly HCl) and solid residue. The results show that there is an interaction in PVC/wood pine mixtures, which affects the degradation of PVC. The same interaction also occurred with the PVC/Polish coal mixture. For the two-stage combustion test, the chemical analysis of char samples taken from the bed of the first reactor, when 100% PVC is used, shows that the chlorine content is below 0.1 wt.% at chlorine to carbon mass ratio<0.001 kg Cl/kg C.",YES,NO,"co-pyrolysis with biomass and coal, no pure plastic oil composition data or focus on oil product",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Pyrolysis studies often overlook the potential of pyrolytic gas as a valuable hydrocarbon resource, thereby hindering the production of advanced carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNM). This study aims to explore various configurations of a multi-zone tubular reactor to upcycle disposable face masks into non-condensable hydrocarbons as potential CNM precursors. The highest gas yield (56.2 wt%) was achieved using a 3-zone configuration (Z-1,3,4), attributed to the end chain scission mechanism. The increased abundance of light hydrocarbons (≤C10) in the resulting liquid confirms a greater extent of end chain scission in the optimum reactor configuration with cold zone retainment. Employing this configuration, different face mask types, including 3ply (polypropylene-based), KF94 (polypropylene-based) and N95 (polyester-based), were utilized as individual feedstocks or in various ratios as mixtures to investigate the resultant composition of hydrocarbon gases. This composition was compared with existing literature studies to identify suitable hydrocarbon gas compositions for CNM production. Mixing 3ply and KF94 face masks produced a consistent gas composition predominantly comprising propylene (62.3 – 66.9%) and ethane (15.4 – 16.8%) via thermal pyrolysis at 500 ℃ with a constant heating rate of 20 ℃/min. However, the inclusion of N95 face masks increased CO2 level fivefold, diminishing the gas quality as a CNM precursor. These findings underscore the necessity of segregating polyester face mask material from polypropylene face mask material prior to pyrolysis to ensure a consistent quality and yield of CNM precursors.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on hydrocarbon gas production for carbon nanomaterials, with oil not being a central product or reported in detail.",TARGET_CNT;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

All dealuminated zeolites were tested for the hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene, showing considerably high activity and selectivity for lighter oils, particularly gasoline. The forced convective steamed zeolite revealed to be the best, given its high number of silanol groups, acidity and porosity, and lower environmental impact. Furthermore, bi-functional Ni-loaded dealuminated zeolites showed good stability and ability to be regenerated. Therefore, it is possible to generate hierarchical zeolites by dealumination with physicochemical and catalytic properties comparable to their rival technologies, following green chemistry metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of the microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) to study catalyzed pyrolysis of the practical polymers comprising most of currently produced plastic wastes. The polymers considered include olefines (HDPE, LDPE, and PP), PS, PMMA, PET, PC, and PVC. Each of the polymers is mixed with one of the two catalysts, ZSM-5 or MgO, and the measurements are undertaken for the catalyst mass fractions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 at several heating rates ranging from 15 to 60 K/min. Strong catalytic effect of ZSM-5 has been demonstrated for the polyolefin polymers (HDPE, LDPE, and PP). Such effect manifests itself in a significant reduction of characteristic pyrolysis temperatures and apparent activation energy; the latter is shown to decrease greatly (by a factor of about two) when the catalyst is added. As the catalyst mass fraction increases up to 0.1 (0.2 for LDPE + ZSM-5 mixture), the saturation is attained, and further addition of the catalyst has no effect. The heat of combustion of pyrolysis volatiles does not reveal a definitive dependence on the catalyst mass fraction, while in some cases the width of pyrolysis temperature interval as well as the char yield are affected. Decomposition of the remaining polymers in presence of ZSM-5 or MgO is either catalyzed rather weakly or even inhibited such as that in PS + ZSM-5 mixture. Among the polymers examined, PC turns out to be the only polymer that is considerably catalyzed by MgO. For the mixtures in which significant catalytic effect was detected, the formal kinetic models have been derived from the microscale measurements and shown to replicate the MCC data at different heating rates. These polymers, both individually and mixed with the catalyst, are often characterized by the non-monotonic conversion function which cannot be approximated by the n-th order reaction model.",NO,NO,The study focuses on microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) for kinetic analysis without reporting liquid/oil composition or yield data.,NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA

Abstract: Zeolite exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins, but the reaction results are often controversial due to the differences in the lab-scale synthesized zeolites and the types of reactors selected. In this work, in order to eliminate the differences of catalysts synthesized by individual researchers, we studied the catalytic performance of four typical commercial zeolites (HZSM-5, Hβ, HY and SAPO-11) in the cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) by self-designed batch reactor. By comparing the reaction performance of four zeolites under the same condition and correlating with the pore structure and acidity of the zeolites, it was found that the acid strength of zeolites was positively correlated with the cracking conversion. HZSM-5 and Hβ zeolites with high acid strength achieved a LDPE conversion of above 94%. Large micropore is beneficial to the formation of isomerized products, but promotes the formation of coke precursors, resulting in serious coking. By analyzing the product distribution over different zeolites, it was observed that Hβ achieved the highest yield of gasoline components. HZSM-5 and HY exhibited high yields of aromatization products. The high aromatization activity of HZSM-5 was attributed to its strong acidity which enhanced the hydrogen transfer process, while HY possesses high concentrations of both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites, and the synergistic effect of these two acid sites promotes the aromatization process.",YES,NO,Catalyst-mechanism-centered study focusing on zeolite acidity and product distribution rather than detailed oil composition or plastic fingerprinting.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The increase in the accumulation of plastic waste, such as polypropylene (PP) used in food packaging, causes serious environmental problems because of its non-biodegradable nature. The pyrolysis process is presented as an efficient thermochemical technique to convert such waste and other wastes into valuable products such as bio-gas, bio-oil, and biochar. Studying the degradation and kinetics of PP is crucial for process optimization and design. In the present study, both different kinetic models and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach were used to study and predict the PP pyrolysis behavior. The kinetic parameters were calculated using different model-free methods with Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data at different heating rates of 15, 30, and 60 °C/min. The activation energy results showed a range between 192.5 and 238.5 kJ/mol, depending on the calculation method used. The Vyazovkin method recorded the most stable values, with an average of 205.5 ± 8.1 kJ/mol, reflecting its reliability in representing the thermal decomposition mechanism of polypropylene. In parallel, the ANN model was developed to predict thermal degradation and other parameters.

As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the oil yields decreased, resulting in the increased production of gas and residual. For the composition of pyrolysis oil, the contents of alkane and olefin reduced while the yields of aromatic, diolefin and cycloalkane increased with increasing temperature. In the pyrolysis gas, increasing temperature promoted the generation of total alkanes and prohibited the production of total olefins. The increasing pressure improved the generation of diolefin, aromatics and cycloalkane to decrease the yield of pyrolysis oil and to increase the production of gas and residue. Under water vapor atmosphere, more liquid hydrocarbons with small molecules were obtained, resulting in the higher oil yields. The yields of alkane and olefin were higher in the presence of water vapor. Under the nitrogen atmosphere, the formation of diolefins, aromatics and cycloalkanes was promoted. The effects of different atmospheres on gas composition was negligible.",YES,YES,HDPE single-polymer pyrolysis with detailed GC-MS oil composition data and oil yield trends across temperature and atmosphere.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: The stability of H-ZSM-11 (H-Z) and H-BETA (H-B) zeolites during the catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied using the same sample of catalyst in eleven consecutive cycles. The gaseous hydrocarbons, liquid hydrocarbons and waxes generated in each cycle were analyzed as well as the used catalyst.

On the contrary, the behavior H-B zeolite was completely different; from the sixth cycle the yields of products changed progressively, approaching to that obtained in a purely thermal process.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the thermal pyrolysis of olive residue, low density polyethylene (LDPE) and olive residue/LDPE mixture in an inert atmosphere of N2 using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).

Based on the results obtained, three temperature regimes were selected for studying the non-isothermal kinetics of olive residue/LDPE mixture. The first two were dominated by the olive residue pyrolysis, while the third was linked to the LDPE pyrolysis, which occurred at much higher temperatures. Discrepancies between the experimental and calculated TG/DTG profiles were considered as a measurement of the extent of interactions occurring on co-pyrolysis.

Abstract: Waste plastic such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was catalytically pyrolyzed and decomposed to produce carbon nanotubes.

The catalyst was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractogram (XRD), BET analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The synthesized carbon nanotubes were performed to assess each bimetallic catalyst's level of activity. Furthermore, the yield, purity, diameter, and number of walls in carbon nanotubes of products synthesized from LDPE using various ratios of bimetallic catalysts were compared. Results show that single metallic catalysts produced single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of diameter ranging from 2.5 nm to 6.5 nm, and bimetallic catalysts produced multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) that have a diameter between 20.7 nm and 38.6 nm.

Abstract: To convert plastic waste into high-value products coupled with CO2 utilization, this study proposed a new concept to produce inherently separated syngas through fast pyrolysis integrated with volatile chemical looping CO2 splitting. Three conversion modes, i.e., redox, cracking and redox-cracking mixed modes, were evaluated using different catalyst, and found that cracking mode with Ni/Al2O3 or Ni/MgAl2O4 exhibited better fuel conversion and syngas separation performance than redox and mixed modes (using Ca2Fe2O5 and Ni/Ca2Fe2O5, respectively), achieving nearly full CO-H2 separation from the syngas product. Focusing on the cracking mode, higher temperature facilitated the fuel and coke conversion, due to the endothermic nature of both reaction stages. The syngas separation efficiency increased during 5 cycles and stabilized ∼95% while using Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst. The redox between Ni0 and Ni2+ was inevitable for both cracking catalysts during multiple cycles due to the Ni-support interaction, limiting the full separation of syngas. The accumulation of low-reactive coke during multiple cycles was another important consideration. Ni/MgAl2O4 possessed weaker Ni-support interaction and less coke accumulation than Ni/Al2O3, thus performed better syngas separation efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize Ni-support interaction and the generation of high-graphitic coke for optimization.",YES,NO,Main focus is syngas production and CO2 splitting with no reported oil composition or meaningful liquid product data.,TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The replacement of natural gas with plastic-derived pyrolysis gas can defossilize H2 production, while subsequent capture, utilization and storage of carbon in a solid form can decarbonize the process. The objective of this study was to investigate H2 production from three types of plastics using a process comprising pyrolysis (600 °C) and thermolysis stages (1200–1500 °C). Depending on the plastic feedstock and thermolysis temperature, the laboratory-scale setup generated 1000–1350 mL/min product gas with H2 purity of 74.3–94.2 vol%. The recovery of 5–9 wt% molecular H2 per mass of plastics was achieved.

Abstract: The single-use of polyolefins-based individual protective equipment has led to the rapid generation of substantial plastic waste. This study aimed at cleaner disposal of the polyolefin waste, and carried out the continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over dual-catalyst beds of MCM-41 and HY. The dual-catalyzed trial was able to produce more condensate fractions with higher selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), compared with using only MCM-41 or HY zeolite. It was because the larger pore size of the MCM-41 catalyst (4.00 nm) could crack long-chain polyolefin intermediates into shorter chains. This alleviates steric and diffusional resistance while entering and exiting the micropores of the HY zeolite (0.74 × 0.74 nm).

Abstract: To mitigate the solid waste crisis, converting waste plastics into valuable products through thermochemical processes, such as through pyrolysis, is emerging. Polylactic acid (PLA) plastics are difficult to separate from other plastics in solid waste, and mixed waste is usually directly landfilled or incinerated. Moreover, studies focused solely on the pyrolysis of PLA plastic remain relatively scarce.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic generated a global upsurge in hospital plastic waste (HPW) as a consequence of the widespread utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) composed of diverse polymer materials. The constant demand for PPE worldwide led to the accumulation of substantial volumes of high-polymer-based plastic waste.

Abstract: The escalating accumulation of plastic waste presents a critical environmental challenge due to its resistance to degradation.

Abstract: Upcycling waste plastics into valuable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen via catalytic pyrolysis is a sustainable strategy to mitigate white pollution. However, real-world plastics are complex and generally contain organic impurities, such as cellulose, which have a non-negligible impact on the catalytic pyrolysis process and product distribution. In this study, cellulose was chosen as a model compound to distinguish the effects of oxygen-containing components on the CNTs and hydrogen production during the catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene. Different amounts of cellulose were mixed with polypropylene to regulate the O/C mass ratio of the feedstock, and the relationship between the O/C mass ratio and the yield of products has been built quantificationally. The results revealed that the relative content of CNTs increased to over 95%, and the stability and purity of carbon deposition increased accordingly when the O/C mass ratio is 0.05. This could be ascribed to the etching effects caused by small amounts of H2O and CO2 on amorphous carbon. However, further increasing the amount of cellulose caused the deactivation of the Fe-Ni catalyst. This not only decreased the carbon yield but had an adverse impact on its morphology and graphitization, leading to the increase of amorphous carbon. This study can provide fundamental guidance for the efficient utilization of waste plastics that take advantage of organic impurities in waste plastic to promote the formation of high-purity CNTs.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on CNT and hydrogen production, with oil not being a central or reported product.",TARGET_CNT;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Chemical recycling of plastic waste is a promising technological alternative for the creation of a circular economy in plastics, enabling them to be used as raw material for the production of new plastics. Chemical looping (CL) technologies can facilitate the chemical recycling of plastics under different configurations. Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) allows combustion with inherent CO2 capture. In CLC, plastic waste can be burned to obtain a highly concentrated CO2 stream from which new plastics can be produced. The transformations involved in chemical looping gasification (CLG) produce a synthesis gas from which monomers can be created for the production of new plastics. The key to optimal operation in all CL processes is determining the most suitable oxygen-carrying material for each application. In this work, three highly reactive Fe-based materials (ilmenite, Fe20 and Mn66FeTi7) were tested as oxygen carriers in a batch fluidized bed reactor. The plastic waste was gasified inside the reactor and the gaseous products react with the oxygen carrier. Ilmenite was proposed as an oxygen carrier for CLG.

Three MPWs showed similarly short carbon number distribution consisting of mainly light liquid products, whereas the fraction of liquid PONA products, etc., was clearly different in the MPW types. For main liquid products, the case of low MPW was olefin components (>75%), medium MPW was aromatic components (>95%) and high MPW was methylmethacrylate (>55%), then aromatic (>20%) and phenol components (>15%).

Abstract: To effectively mitigate the environmental and ecological impacts stemming from polymer wastes, the development of innovative recycling and reusing strategies is of utmost importance. In response to the call of “Waste-to-Wealth”, this study presents a green and efficient method to convert waste polypropylene (waste protective cloths, WPC) into Ni@CNTs hybrids via catalytic carbonization. Subsequently, these Ni@CNTs hybrids are directly applied as functional nanofillers to prepare fire resistant polycarbonate (PC) composites. The experimental results demonstrated that the combined catalysts composed of NiCl2/Ni(C5H7O2)2 were efficient in catalyzing WPC into Ni@ CNTs hybrids, achieving the yield was as high as 58.6 g/100 g WPC. Leveraging the superior characteristics of Ni@CNTs hybrids, they were used as a fire retardant of polycarbonate (PC) matrix to fabricate PC/Ni@CNTs composites. The PC/3Ni@CNTs exhibited excellent fire retardancy, as evidenced by the limited oxygen index (LOI) of 30.5 %, the V0 rating in UL-94 vertical burning test, and the 64.1 % reduction in the peak of heat release rate (PHRR) in cone calorimeter test. Meanwhile, it displayed low toxicity with 75.0 % reduction in the peak of CO production (COP). The mechanism was attributed to the synergistic effects of Ni and CNTs, which combine the catalyzing carbonization and the enhanced char layer together in condensed phase.

Abstract: Although clay minerals have been widely used as catalysts and catalyst supports, the reports of natural clay minerals studied in their role as a catalyst are still rare. This work, therefore, for the first time reports the possible catalytic effects of the two raw vermiculites from Brazil (VerS) and Palabora (VerP) on the depolymerization of polystyrene (PS). The main experimental methods used to obtain a detailed structural characterization of vermiculites before and after the depolymerization experiment were X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric DTA/TG analysis, infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed assignment of the vibration bands of vermiculites occurring in the near-IR and the analysis of carbon coatings on the surface of vermiculite using Raman spectra are performed for the first time. The thermal products of PS are styrene monomer (SM) about 54.5 mass% and pyrolytic volatile oligomers (dimers and trimers) about 32.1 mass%.

Abstract: Disposal of waste plastics is an environmental problem that has gained attention over the years. Co-pyrolysis is a promising alternative for transforming this material into solid and liquid products with high added value. This study evaluated how heating rates and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) proportions influence the properties of char obtained by co-pyrolysis. The co-pyrolysis process was carried out using Eucalyptus spp biomass, in three proportions of PET (0, 15 and 25 %) and three heating rates (1, 3 and 5 °C min−1), at a final temperature of 450 °C. We investigated the physical, chemical, energetic and thermal properties of the char produced, which included its morphology via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average yield of co-pyrolytic char, under all conditions of co-pyrolysis, decreased by 5 % compared to the biomass-only pyrolytic material. In addition to yield differences, the percentage of ash decreased by about 7 % in char with PET.

Abstract: Chemical recycling of plastic waste via thermochemical processes is essential to move to a carbo-circular economy, reducing our dependence of fossil resources. However, recovering monomers from polyolefins in one or multiple steps is challenging due to their chemical inertness. In the present work, a tandem micro-pyrolyzer coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and FID/ToF-MS detectors was utilized to study the performance of industrial formulations of steam-treated FCC catalysts and HZSM-5 additives for the in-line catalytic upgrading of polyolefin pyrolysis products towards light olefins and aromatics in two steps. When upgrading pyrolysis vapors from LDPE over the steam-treated catalysts at 600 °C, CH4 yields did not exceed 0.5 wt% due to their low acidity. The FCC catalyst formulations obtained higher yields of C5-C11 aliphatics (up to 42 wt%) and were more active in converting C12 + products than the HZSM-5-containing additives. The highest C2-C4 olefin selectivity of 53 wt% was obtained using a bare steam-treated HZSM-5 additive.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste can serve as a means of refining nature from the non-degradable plastic pollutants while producing a significant amount of liquid fuel required for the transportation industry. The low quality of the produced liquid fuel is often a fundamental challenge in pyrolysis, which can be overcome by utilizing catalysts. In this study, an upgraded zeolite Y catalyst has been employed. However, one of the main issues with zeolites is their small pore size, which restricts the entry of heavy polymer compounds and only allows small molecules to enter. To address this limitation, an innovative approach has been applied in this research where MIL-53 (Cu) is loaded onto the surface of the zeolite. After pyrolysis, it was determined that a composite of copper and its oxides, enclosed in a carbon nanocarbon shell C60 and C70, has been loaded onto the surface of the zeolite. This inexpensive composite exhibit behavior similar to noble and expensive metals due to its high electron transfer density. Additionally, analyses XRD, FTIR, BET, XRF, EDX, GC–MS, NH3-TPD and CHNSO were utilized for the characterization of the catalyst and the liquid fuel. Furthermore, three key parameters were selected for experimental design: temperature (375–525 °C), catalyst loading in the reactor (2.5–17.5 %), and support crystallinity percentage (0–100 %). Using a response surface approach, the impact of these parameters on the liquid fuel production efficiency was investigated. Ultimately, the produced liquid fuel was separated into three fractions: gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel.

Abstract: Pyrolysis contributes to the transition of the tyre industry towards a circular economy model. Tyre rubber is a complex blend of polymers, inorganic additives and grades of carbon black, depending on the tyre type and section. The products of the end-of-life tyres (ELTs) pyrolysis are heavily influenced by the original composition, so separation prior to pyrolysis could be an important step in optimising the recycling process. However, recyclers often ignore the composition of ELTs. This study aims to develop a simple methodology for evaluating the potential resource recovery of ETLs samples from a set of thermogravimetric experiments applying a Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM). Pyrolysis experiments were also carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to analyse the composition of the products. Direct linear relations were identified between specific values of the initial mass fraction parameter of the DAEM and the natural and synthetic rubber content, and notably with the limonene content in the pyrolysis oils. A high 12 wt% limonene in the oil product was obtained from the sample with the 83 wt% natural rubber content at 450 ºC. In addition, significant differences in the ash content were observed in the raw recovered carbon black from the tread sections (31 wt%-55 wt%) to the non-tread sections of the ELTs (7 wt%-16 wt%), which had a positive effect on its quality.

Abstract: The slow pyrolysis of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated in a batch autoclave reactor at 430–490 °C and reaction times of 15–60 min, with the aim of obtaining the maximum yield of plastic oil (PO) with an adequate composition for its subsequent valorization in refinery.

Simulated distillation and gas chromatography analyses of PO have shown its potential for its valorization in a waste refinery scheme targeting the production of alternative fuels. Thus, the PO obtained at 430 °C and 15 min is suitable to be cofed to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit since it has a simulated distillation curve similar to that of vacuum gasoil (VGO). On the other hand, the PO obtained at 430 °C at the longest reaction time and those obtained at 460 °C are suitable to be fed together with light cycle oil (LCO) into a hydroprocessing unit.

A product yield and properties from a fluidized bed system were comprehensively analyzed and compared with those from a fixed-bed system. The fluidized-bed reactor well converted ABS and PP wastes into pyrolysis fuel, exhibiting higher medium and low fraction (C5 ∼ C22 of 89.17 % for ABS) as compared to the amount from a fixed bed reactor (84.7 %) whereas LDPE and PP resulted in the similar product yields in the range of C5 ∼ C22 from both reactors.

Abstract: A wind turbine blade consists of pure glass fiber-reinforced polymer composites (GFRPs) and the sandwich part with core materials. Pyrolysis is a prospective technology to recycle end-of-life blades, but the pyrolysis performance of blades with core materials is still unclear. In this study, three retired blade parts were pyrolyzed, i.e., pure GFRPs, GFRPs filled with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam, and GFRPs filled with balsa wood. The results showed that CH4, CO, and CO2 were the majority of the pyrolysis gas when the pure GFRPs part was pyrolyzed at 400ºC, with five typical phenolic products in the pyrolysis oil, containing bisphenol A, phenol, 4-isopropenyl phenol, 4-isopropyl phenol, and o-cresol. As the temperature increased to 550ºC, the content of CH4 reached 48.0 vol% while that of CO2 reduced, raising the calorific value of the pyrolysis gas to 27.2 MJ/Nm3. Meanwhile, the content of bisphenol A in the pyrolysis oil rapidly increased, owing to the enhanced breakage of oligomers. As PET foam was filled, CO2 was dominant in the pyrolysis gas, and the content of benzoic acid became comparable with those of phenols in the pyrolysis oil. Whilst several hydrocarbon substances were detected when balsa wood was filled, making the oil product more complex. In terms of solid products, char residues over the black fibers were formed mainly due to the decomposition of epoxy resin rather than core materials, and the oxidation duration should be extended when recovering the blade parts with sandwich structures. Moreover, elevating the pyrolysis temperature reduced the pyrolytic residues but degraded the recovered fibers’ tensile strengths. The conclusions suggested that the blade parts with sandwich structures should be pyrolyzed separately, considering the core materials and their components.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with balsa wood and PET foam, without clear data on pure plastic oil composition, and focus on composite material behavior rather than plastic fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

In this study, pyrolysis of battery separator in the lithium-ion battery was studied to fundamentally understand the thermal degradation of volatile compounds in the batteries and to recover hydrocarbons and syngas (H2/CO). To make this practice more environmentally sound, CO2 was used as a co-reactant. Pyrolysis under inert atmosphere (N2) was studied as a reference. Prior to battery separator pyrolysis, the composition of the separator (tri-layer of PP/PE/PP) and its thermolytic profile were confirmed. Single-stage pyrolysis converted the separator into aliphatic liquid hydrocarbons, while double-stage pyrolysis produced benzene derivatives, H2 and C1-2 hydrocarbons under both N2/CO2 environments. To further convert hydrocarbons into H2, NCM (lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide) cathode, one of widely used Li-ion battery cathodes, was used as a catalyst. In the presence of NCM catalyst, H2 production increased 25 times higher.

Abstract: Thermochemical conversion of plastic wastes into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen is a promising management option to eliminate their hazardous effect. The yields and morphologies of CNTs strongly depend on the catalyst design and reaction conditions. To boost the efficiency, tuning of bimetallic nanoparticles as catalyst is an effective approach. For that reason, A-site-deficient perovskite La0·8Ni1-xCoxO3-δ (LN1-xCx, x = 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) was developed and used as a catalyst precursor to achieve in situ formation of bimetallic Ni–Co nanoparticles. At an optimized Ni-to-Co ratio, the LN0.5C0.5 exhibited the highest yields of multi-walled CNTs, namely 840 and 853 mg/gcatalyst from high density polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. This could be attributed to the higher catalytic capability of LN0.5C0.5 catalyst for the decomposition of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon. In both cases, multi-walled CNTs had regular shapes when the reaction temperature was 700 °C.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics offers a sustainable approach to transform plastic waste into valuable carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes.

In addition, the powder catalysts remain entangled with the product carbonaceous materials and are difficult to separate. To mitigate these challenges, here, we present the first example of an interfacial self-assembly based approach for the construction of bulk catalysts with well-defined nanoscale morphologies for catalytic pyrolysis. The versatility of the self-assembly approach allowed us to deposit model Fe3O4 catalyst nanoparticles onto various types of supporting materials (S304, Ni, Ti, and Cu) to systematically investigate their impact on catalytic efficiency. Our studied revealed that CNT formation is influenced significantly by substrate-introduced effects. Among the tested supports, S304 system offered the highest selectivity for CNT growth, giving a carbon yield with a value of 207 mg/g plastic. While Ni and Ti generated more carbon products but with lower CNT mass ratio.

Abstract: Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization of protozeolitic nanounits previously functionalized with two types of commercially available organosilanes. The first one (N,N-diethyl-3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane, DEAMP) is a monopodal organosilane that contains a tertiary amine group, whereas the second one (1,2-bis(trimethoxysilyl)decane, BTMDC) includes a long aliphatic chain and two tri-alkoxysilyl groups (dipodal organosilane). The properties of the samples obtained have been compared with two nanocrystalline ZSM-5 materials as references. While both organosilanes are effective in generation of a secondary porosity, enhancing strongly the textural properties of ZSM-5 zeolite, DEAMP affords for more uniform nanounits in the aggregates with narrower mesopore size distribution compared to BTMDC. On the other hand, varying the concentration of DEAMP during the silanization step (in the range of 2.5–10 mol%, referred to the silica content of the synthesis gel) it has been possible to synthesize hierarchical ZSM-5 samples showing progressively smaller size of the nanounits in the aggregates.

Abstract: Depolymerization of polyethylene (PE) is one of the most challenging tasks in the chemical upcycling of PE-based plastic wastes because the disassociation of the stable carbon–carbon bonds in PE is only possible at a very high reaction temperature. The thermal liquefaction of PE cable plastic waste in a stainless-steel batch reactor was thoroughly evaluated in this study. The effect of different liquefaction methods (hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), ionic liquids catalyzed HTL, and solvothermal liquefaction (STL)) on the yields of product fractions (oil products, solid residue, and gas) and the properties of the oil products were examined. At 350 °C and 90 min reaction duration, the conversion (%) of 75.43%, the oil yield of 39.33%, the energy recovery rate of 39.7%, the higher heating values (HHV) of 43.83 MJ/kg for the oil samples, and the lower boiling range molecular distribution were obtained by the solvothermal liquefaction method with acetone as a solvent. The HHV of the oil samples obtained in the STL method (43.28–43.83 MJ/kg) is comparable to that of gasoline (HHV − 43.4 MJ/kg). The contribution of the solvent to the depolymerization reaction was mainly the dissolution and dispersion of feedstock by solvation, therefore reducing thermal cracking temperature through enhanced mass and thermal energy transfer. In thermal liquefaction, solvent and feedstock had a low level of solvolysis reactions, so the depolymerization reaction mainly follows thermal cracking.

The concentration of H2 obtained from the co-pyrolysis of CS and PP (the ratio is 1:1) was 32.7 vol% without catalysts, which exceeds the average concentration of 28.4 vol% ((27.1 + 29.7)/2) at 550 °C, indicating a synergistic effect between CS and PP.

Abstract: The pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was qualitatively analyzed by TG-FTIR, and HCl removal efficiency of Ca-based additives were semi-quantitatively studied also by means of TG-FTIR. Additionally, the thermodynamic equilibrium modeling was also carried out to understand the formation of HCl from PVC and from mixtures of PVC with different additives. Experimental results showed that the pyrolysis of PVC took place in two steps accompanied by the release of HCl and hydrocarbon, respectively. Almost all Cl transformed to HCl, and hardly any other kinds of Cl compounds were detected. The addition of Ca-based additives extended the second weight loss step of PVC, but they did not affect the release time when the maximum HCl concentration appeared. The maximum HCl concentration decreased according to the increase of additive amount, that is to say, the HCl removal efficiency increased as the Ca/Cl molar ratio increased, however when the Ca/Cl ratio increased to a certain value, the increase of HCl removal efficiency was not proportional to the increase of additive amount.

Abstract: Pyrolysis combined to either thermal cracking or catalytic cracking of municipal solid waste was performed in a laboratory-scale facility consisting of a fixed-bed reactor followed by a tubular cracking reactor. The results showed great potential for the production of syngas. The incorporation of inexpensive and widely available dolomite in the cracking reactor (with a constant feedstock to calcined dolomite ratio of 5:1) favoured the catalytic cracking of the primary pyrolysis products towards H2 and CO in a temperature range of 800–900 °C.

Additionally, a homogeneous solid fuel was obtained as a solid residue, which can be used to provide additional energy to support the process or as a refuse-derived fuel.

Abstract: This work focuses on the pyrolysis-gasification of real waste polymers in one stage tubular reactor with and without catalyst at 550 °C and 850 °C. Moreover, the possibility for dry reforming by in situ CO2 generation was also investigated using dolomite. To enhance the syngas production from waste plastics, Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthetized by wet impregnation with 4.82% of Ni, then the catalyst was loaded by further elements in ~2% concentration (Ca, Ce, La, Mg, and Mn). The composition of gases and liquid products was measured by gas-chromatography, while the coke deposition on the spent catalysts was followed by temperature-programmed oxidation. It was found that a large amount of amorphous carbons was produced at 550 °C with Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. The in-situ addition of the carbon-dioxide can enhance the production of syngas because both the hydrogen and carbon-monoxide concentration can drastically increase. Furthermore, the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface can be reduced by using dolomite.

Rice husk (RH) and polypropylene (PP) as typical biomass and plastic fractions in OSW, were co-pyrolyzed at different blend ratios and different temperatures.

In the fluidized bed, L R in the presence of CaO, Ca(OH)2, and CaO + Ca(OH)2 was 34.5%, 41.2%, and 38.9 wt%, respectively. The fraction of phenolic compounds in the pyrolysis oil ranged from 86% to 93%, about 1–3% higher than the corresponding values in the fixed bed. Using additives led to lower halide content in the pyrolysis oil of the fluidized bed than that of the fixed bed. However, the opposite trend was observed in the absence of additives.

Abstract: Pyrolysis can effectively convert waste tires into high-value products. However, the sulfur-containing compounds in pyrolysis oil and gas would significantly reduce the environmental and economic feasibility of this technology. Here, the desulfurization and upgrade of waste tire pyrolysis oil and gas were performed by adding different metal oxides (Fe2O3, CuO, and CaO). Results showed that Fe2O3 exhibited the highest removal efficiency of 87.7 % for the sulfur-containing gas at 600 °C with an outstanding removal efficiency of 99.5 % for H2S. CuO and CaO were slightly inferior to Fe2O3, with desulfurization efficiencies of 75.9 % and 45.2 % in the gas when added at 5 %. Fe2O3 also demonstrated a notable efficacy in eliminating benzothiophene, the most abundant sulfur compound in pyrolysis oil, with a removal efficiency of 78.1 %. Molecular dynamics simulations and experiments showed that the desulfurization mechanism of Fe2O3 involved the bonding of Fe-S, the breakage of C-S, dehydrogenation and oxygen migration process, which promoted the conversion of Fe2O3 to FeO, FeS and Fe2(SO4)3.

Abstract: The recycling of end-of-life wind turbine blades has become a global environmental challenge driven by the rapid growth of wind power. Pyrolysis is a promising method for recovering glass fibers from these discarded blades, but traditional pyrolysis is often operated at high temperatures, which degrades the mechanical properties of recovered fibers. To address this issue, a swelling-assisted pyrolysis method was proposed to recover high-quality glass fibers from end-of-life wind turbine blades at low temperatures. The results confirmed that the decomposition of the resin matrix within the blade was significantly promoted at low temperatures in the swelling-assisted pyrolysis process, achieving a resin decomposition ratio of 76.8 % at 350 °C. This improvement was attributed to enhanced heat transfer and co-pyrolysis with acetic acid. Swelling could physically disrupt the cross-linked structure of the blade, creating a more porous and layered structure, thereby enhancing heat transfer during the pyrolysis process. Simultaneously, the co-pyrolysis with acetic acid could generate hydrogen radicals, which promoted the cracking of macromolecular oligomers into lighter products or gaseous alkanes. Consequently, the formation of pyrolysis char within the solid pyrolysis product was reduced, shortening the oxidation duration to 30 min. In comparison to traditional pyrolysis, the swelling-assisted pyrolysis process effectively suppressed the diffusion of surface defects over the recovered fibers, leading to promising improvements in their flexibility, elasticity, and mechanical properties, with tensile strength notably increased by 27.5 %.

Abstract: The catalytic cracking of polyolefinic waste materials over solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites, is a promising process for the production of useful fuels and chemicals. However, the inherent diffusional constraints of the microporous zeolites restrict the access of bulky polyolefin molecules to the active site, therefore limiting their effectiveness. To address this, a simple yet effective method of producing mesoporous Al-SBA-15 materials with a high density of Brønsted acid sites has been employed. These catalysts are shown to be very active for the catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE), a common waste plastic. The acidic and textural properties of the catalysts were characterised by ICP-OES, XPS, XRD, N2 physisorption, propylamine-TPD, pyridine-FTIR and STEM and have been correlated with their catalytic activity. The product distribution from the catalytic cracking of LDPE has been shown to depend strongly on both the pore architecture and the Al content of the SBA-15 and thus the density and strength of Brønsted acid sites. Fine-tuning the Al content of the SBA-15 materials can direct the product distribution of the hydrocarbons.

The properties of the produced crude plastic pyrolytic oil (CPPO or crude PPO), such as higher heating value (HHV), cetane index, lubricity, flash point, etc, obtained by pyrolysis of MWP, and MVP samples, confirmed that the oil was not suitable for direct use as an automobile fuel. Therefore, CPPO was further refined by vacuum distillation to match the properties of standard diesel more closely, herein referred as distilled plastic diesel (DPD). Some of the properties of DPD did not meet the standard diesel criteria, which is why DPD was further refined through a hydrotreatment process to ensure it was directly comparable to standard diesel, herein referred as hydrotreated plastic diesel (HPD).

Abstract: The organic and inorganic additives in PVC plastics cause great difficulties in their actual recycling process, which are different from pure PVC polymer (PVC-PO). In this study, PVC-PO and two commercial PVC plastics were selected and their differences in structure, pyrolysis behavior, chlorine release and migration were compared by FTIR, TG-MS and a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor. There were more oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic compounds in the commercial PVC plastics than PVC-PO because of the addition of foaming agents, flame retardants and lubricants. The thermal weight loss of the commercial PVC plastics was divided into three stages due to the decomposition of additives and the releases of CO2 gas, while that of the PVC-PO was two. The pyrolysis tar of two PVC plastics contained 35.72% and 15.71% oxygenated compounds, respectively, while that obtained from PVC-PO contained 96.46% of aromatic compounds. In addition, calcium additives in PVC plastics could promote the cracking of heavy constituents in the volatile, which was favorable for the formation of more light fractions in tar. The pyrolysis gas of PVC-PO was mainly composed of H2 and C1-C4 hydrocarbon gases, while that of PVC plastics contained about 50% of CO2, followed by H2 and hydrocarbon gases. The chlorine content of the PVC-PO (55.88 wt.%) was higher than that of the PVC plastics (13.83 wt.%, 22.77 wt.%).

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of biomass with hydrogen-rich feedstock is a promising technology to improve bio-oil quality, in which understanding the synergistic effects and product of sewage sludge (SS) with two types of plastic waste (HDPE, LDPE) is essential to develop co-pyrolysis technology. This work used in situ tracking to detect co-pyrolysis promotion/inhibition effects with different mixed feedstocks and mixing ratios, and analyzed volatile and bio-oils in detail. The results show that co-pyrolysis synergistic promotion was mainly created by the release of a large amounts of free radicals, and the largest promotion occurred near the maximum mass loss rate (DTGmax). The synergistic promotion effect was 190 % higher for SS mixed with HDPE (S–H) than for SS mixed with LDPE (S-L).

Abstract: Plastic waste poses a critical environmental challenge for the world. The proliferation of waste plastic coffee pods exacerbates this issue. Traditional disposal methods such as incineration and landfills are environmentally unfriendly, necessitating the exploration of alternative management strategies. One promising avenue is the pyrolysis in-line reforming process, which converts plastic waste into hydrogen. However, traditional pyrolysis methods are costly due to inefficiencies and heat losses. To address this, for the first time, our study investigates the use of microwave to enhance the pyrolysis process. We explored microwave pyrolysis for polypropylene (PP), high-density polypropylene (HDPE), and waste coffee pods, with the latter primarily comprising polypropylene. Additionally, catalytic ex-situ pyrolysis of coffee pod pyrolysis over a nickel-based catalyst was investigated to convert the evolved gas into hydrogen.

Abstract: The polyolefins mild cracking experiments have been carried out in a closed batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere over a temperature range from 370 °C to 420 °C and the characterization of the mild cracking products has been investigated. The objective of this work is to study the cracking mechanism and reaction path for the mild cracking of polyolefins with lower heating rate (the isothermal and non-isothermal process), and to find the appropriate operating conditions (temperature and residence time) for optimal yield of liquid hydrocarbons (oils/waxes) as the suitable feedstock of olefin recovery. The advantages of this work can be summarized as high yield of light fraction, low aromatics content and mild cracking conditions. More viscosity-reducing and less volatiles-loss can be simultaneously achieved in mild cracking of polyolefins by selecting the reasonable residence time-temperature combination. The results confirm that chain scission reactions are significantly predominant in these experimental conditions. Intramolecular hydrogen transfer and intermolecular hydrogen transfer, which are responsible for the reduction in molecular weight of liquid products, can be improved in lower temperature and longer residence time, and intermolecular hydrogen transfer can also be enhanced in the PE/PP mixture cracking.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of plastic waste allows to produce liquid fractions, but their molecular weight distributions are typically very large whereas it would be interesting to focus on light hydrocarbons. In this study, the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was investigated using a semi-batch, vertical glass reactor heated at 480 °C equipped with a reflux condenser. The pyrolysis was performed with and without a reflux condenser. The temperature at the top of this reflux condenser was ranged from 125 °C to 200 °C depending on the heating power at the wall of this condenser. The permanent gas yield (C1 to C4) ranged between 20.9 wt% and 25.8 wt% when the reflux was used. The gas contained mainly hydrocarbons with a carbon range from C1 to C4 and H2 in a smaller extent. Their kinetic profiles followed a similar trend, i.e they exhibited a maximum with time. The GC-MS/FID detected mainly olefinic hydrocarbons (olefins) with less than 28 carbons. The major hydrocarbons obtained were light and heavy naphtha cuts when the reflux was used. The range of light naphtha (C5-C7) was between 13.1 and 16.7 wt% and the range of heavy naphtha (C8-C12) was between 69.1 and 87.2 wt% of the total mass fraction detected.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis is an environmentally friendly recycling method, which has attracted remarkable attention due to worldwide issues of the production and accumulation of plastic wastes. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was carried out in a dual-bed semi-batch reactor over the Si-rich Ni/ZSM-5 nanocatalyst at atmospheric pressure. The parent nanocatalyst was prepared by hydrothermal technique and modified with nickel promoter (0–25 wt%). The properties of the nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, NH3-TPD, and TG-DTA techniques. The results showed the high crystallinity, spherical particles, and high specific surface area (376 m2g−1). The impact of operational conditions was evaluated to maximize the production of the high value-added compounds. The high percentage of the Ni promoter (25 wt%) led to the highest amount of gasoline range hydrocarbons (61%). The appropriate operational conditions were temperature of 525 °C, catalyst to plastic ratio of 1:20, and 2.5 ml min−1 nitrogen flow rate, resulting in the best product distribution: aromatics (39.4%), olefins (28.3%), and paraffins (15%). The reusability of the nanocatalyst showed high performance and more aromatic production. The characterization results of the used nanocatalyst confirmed the high stability through the pyrolysis reaction and lack of significant structural defect. The developed nanocatalyst represented the high activity through the pyrolysis of the real LDPE plastic waste, including the major product distribution in the gasoline range hydrocarbons.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on maximizing gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics production using a customized Ni-promoted nanocatalyst, with no reported detailed oil composition or plastic-specific fingerprint data.",TARGET_AROMATICS;EXOTIC_CATALYST;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Thermal conversion technology is an effective means to transform waste plastics into high-value-added products. This study explored the thermal decomposition characteristics and cracking mechanism of four different types of plastics (polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) for thermal conversion technology. The findings revealed that PP exhibited the highest hydrogen yield, reaching 3.56 mmol/g at 510°C. PET's gas production was predominantly comprised of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. PVC gas products contained a significant amount of HCl, followed by hydrogen and methane. For solid products, the carbon yield followed the order PET > PVC > PS > PP, with the carbon content of PET accounting for 35.63% of the total products. PP and PS demonstrated higher oil yields for liquid products than PET and PVC. The oil yield of PP was 94.38%. Further analysis of the cracking mechanism found that during the thermal decomposition process, plastics underwent random fragmentation, leading to reactions such as β-scission, intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen transfer, rearrangement, cyclization, etc., due to structural variations.

Abstract: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a thermoplastic polymer, is the main raw material in the manufacturing of clear bottles used mainly for water and soft drinks. In 2022, the world plastics production was 400.3 million tons; around 6.2 % corresponds to PET, and only 10 % of it is recycled. PET waste can only be recycled four times because high temperatures generate chemical and physical degradation. This study aims to apply the principles of circular economy to transform PET waste into crude oil through fast catalytic pyrolysis, under N2 atmosphere at different temperatures and with different quantities of zeolite as a catalyst. The crude oil was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and solution quantitative 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR). To compare the test results, a simulation for the pyrolysis reactor was conducted with CHEMCAD software. The result of FTIR analysis showed the presence of carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups, and 13C NMR also shows presence of aromatic C–C and C–O bonds, aliphatic C–O and C–C bonds and carbonyl groups. The experimental results, which were comparable to the simulation, also show that a ratio of 12.5 % zeolite catalyst to waste PET helps the decomposition process and reduces the operating temperature needed in the reactor.

Abstract: Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste is a promising approach for producing renewable biofuels and value-added chemicals. However, because of their different pyrolysis behaviors, the synergy between biomass and plastic is limited, and low-yield aromatics are produced. Herein, a modified segmented catalytic co-pyrolysis technology was proposed, and the effects of pyrolysis parameters were studied in detail to enhance the synergistic effect between feedstocks. For the biomass section (segment 1), catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of poplar sawdust was conducted, and results showed that employing 15 wt% MgCl2 at 500 °C facilitated the production of furans. For the plastic section (segment 2), CFP of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were performed. It was showed that instead of Y and beta zeolites, the utilization of ZSM-5 as a pyrolysis catalyst with a loading of ZSM-5/HDPE = 1.0, and a temperature of 600 °C was beneficial for the production of short-chain olefins. For the segmented co-pyrolysis of poplar sawdust and HDPE (segment 1 + segment 2), the biomass-to-plastic ratio was crucial in aromatics production.

Abstract: Fast pyrolysis coupled with catalysis is a promising method for recycling waste plastic into value-added fuels, chemicals, and carbon materials. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was pretreated by non-thermal plasma (NTP) in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor where the discharge zone was packed with quartz glass beads, which enables the HDPE to present a low-degree of polymerization, high crystallinity, and rough surface morphology. The fast pyrolysis of pretreated HDPE significantly increased the content of C2–C4 light olefins in the pyrolysis vapors, notably the C2H4 content increasing by 19.78 % and 27.88 % after Ar and air NTP treatment, respectively. Compared with Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3, the novel 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst, which are characterized by a higher density of strong acid sites and superior ability to cleavage C−C and C−H bonds, possessed superior activity in upgrading of pyrolysis vapors, achieving a high H2 yield equivalent to 91.65 % hydrogen in HDPE.

Abstract: Using waste plastics as a reburning fuel is promising for both reducing NOx emissions and managing plastic waste. To gain a better understanding of the chemistry involved in plastic reburning, pyrolysis products of different types of plastics at typical reburning temperatures (900–1200 °C) were investigated experimentally, and the reburning performance of simulated plastic pyrolysis gases was studied through experiments and chemical kinetic modeling. The plastics involved in the pyrolysis experiments included high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide 6 (PA6), and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS). HDPE exhibited the highest hydrocarbon gas yield (up to ∼ 70 wt% at 900 °C) while ABS had the lowest gas yield (<20 wt%) among the four plastics at the investigated temperatures. The hydrocarbon gas was composed mainly of methane, ethylene, and acetylene, with ethylene decreasing and acetylene increasing with temperatures rising from 900 to 1200 °C. Hydrogen cyanide was found to be the dominant gaseous nitrogen-containing compound for PA6 and ABS. Solid byproducts such as soot were generated at pyrolysis temperatures exceeding 1100 °C, leading to a reduction of the gas yield for all plastics. This indicates a potentially important contribution of heterogeneous NO reduction mechanisms during plastic reburning at high temperatures. Concerning the homogeneous NO reduction, reburning experiments using simulated plastic pyrolysis gases composed of methane, ethylene, and/or acetylene were carried out at 700–1200 °C in a flow reactor with an initial NO concentration of 1000 ppm and an excess air ratio λ of 0.7. Results for the simulated plastic pyrolysis gases showed NO reduction efficiencies ranging from 30 % to 46 % within the temperature range 950–1200 °C.

Abstract: Chemical recycling by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis/degradation offers the possibility of converting waste plastics into their original monomers or other valuable chemicals which can be used as feedstocks in chemical and petrochemical industries. Plastic wastes of polystyrene (PS) based materials can be a good source of styrene as well as mono-aromatic (BTEX: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) compounds. The selectivity of pyrolysis products can be tuned by choosing the right catalyst as well as appropriate operating conditions/operation modes. In this regard, the focus of the present work was to perform thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of different waste polystyrene (WPS) feedstocks over acid and base catalysts employed in ex-situ and in-situ modes. The main goal was to compare the compositions of pyrolysis products obtained by changing feedstocks, catalysts and operation modes. A further goal was to discuss the suitability of the catalysts employed for the enhanced recovery of desired products from WPS pyrolysis. It was demonstrated that expanded polystyrene gives very similar product distribution as compared to virgin PS, both giving high styrene content. Likewise, hard PS-based random packing materials produce similar results as compared to high impact polystyrene (HIPS). Moreover, it was shown that solid base catalysts influence the composition of the pyrolysis products only slightly as compared to thermolysis.

Abstract: Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure energy security have led to increased interest in renewable energy technologies, particularly pyrolysis for converting waste into fuel.

Single-cylinder engine tests were conducted on PPO and PSO, each blended with DF in mass proportions of 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. The engine featured a state-of-the-art compression ignition combustion system, including an 8-hole high-pressure injector and precisely controlled air and exhaust gas recirculation paths. Results proved that both PPO and PSO could be efficiently combusted in modern compression ignition systems, provided their admixture with reference DF did not exceed 60 %. For optimal performance, the engine control map needed to be re-calibrated to prevent over-homogenization of the pilot spray, caused by higher volatility and reduced fuel reactivity. When maximising waste-derived components, PPO provided optimal emission results (1.37 g/kWh NOX and 0.04 g/kWh PM) when combined with heavy EGR and advanced injection timing. In this case, the total emissions overlimit value was 3.7, compared to 7.3 in the best-case DF scenario (a 50 % reduction in cumulative emissions).

Abstract: Poly(bisphenol A carbonate) or polycarbonate (PC) constitutes a significant fraction of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, mainly due to its high production and consumption rate and its variety of applications. Traditional methods for its treatment no longer appear to provide long-term solutions and for this reason, the investigation of thermochemical methods and more specifically pyrolysis as a potential recycling method took place in the current study. In the first part of this study, pyrolysis studies of polycarbonate have been performed in a Pyrolizer equipped with GC–MS, at five different reactor temperatures, in order to facilitate the understanding of the degradation mechanism. Higher pyrolysis temperatures were found to be more suitable for PC pyrolysis, since they increased the volatile fractions (liquid and gaseous). The gaseous fraction consisted mainly of CO2, CH4 and CO, whereas in the liquid fraction a large amount of different phenolic compounds, including the monomer bisphenol A was recorded. Based on the findings, it has been suggested that the main degradation pathway follows a chain scission mechanism and that the scission of the isopropylidene linkage is the first step. Phenols and phenolic compounds were formed through a series of scission and hydrolysis reactions. In the second part, pyrolysis kinetics of PC are investigated in detail using thermogravimetric experimental data, collected at several heating rates and several either model-free (isoconversional) or model-fitting models. From the isoconversional kinetic analysis the effective activation energy was fund to increase with the extent of conversion, ranging from 146 to 189 kJ/mol and from 154 to 215 kJ/mol, when using the integral method of Tang (similar to the KAS) or the differential method of Friedman, respectively. A simple first order kinetic model was found to simulate excellent the experimental data, though predicting different activation energies and pre-exponential factors at each heating rate employed.

The GC-MS(Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)and FT-IR (Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy) were taken for pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene and compared with diesel.

The emission results showed an increase in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC)and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)emissions. The multiple times increase in emissions is due to the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons and higher carbon number of saturated compounds in PPO.

Abstract: This work explores low-pressure catalytic hydropyrolysis for upcycling plastics from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Three Pd-based catalysts (using Al2O3, n-ZSM-5, and SiO2 as supports) were investigated. Experiments were performed in a custom-made reactor operating at 550 °C / 350 °C in the thermal / catalytic zones, respectively, under 50 vol% H2/N2 as the carrier / reactive gas and at 6 bar. The main product was the oil fraction (yields over 65 wt%), having a high concentration of valuable aromatic hydrocarbons, coming mainly from ABS and PS polymers contained in the raw WEEE plastics. Among the three catalysts, Pd/SiO2 exhibited the best performance, sharply reducing the Cl content in the oil and achieving complete Br removal.

Abstract: The catalytic effect of HZSM-5 zeolite was studied on the thermal decomposition of model waste mixtures of plastics (composed of PE, PP, and PET) and biomass (composed of newspaper, cardboard, and pine sawdust). The influence of temperature and catalyst ratio as well as the hindering effect of cellulose and lignin on the catalytic decomposition of plastic waste were studied applying analytical pyrolysis at low and high heating rate by thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), respectively. The products of laboratory scale batch pyrolysis and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis were analyzed in details and compared. HZSM-5 catalyst reduced the thermal stability of plastic waste, but the catalytic effect was blocked when 50% cellulose or 10% lignin were mixed in the plastic waste. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to reveal correlations between the composition of pyrolysis products, pyrolysis temperature and proportion of the applied catalyst. It was established that the hindering effect of biomass could be compensated by applying higher catalyst ratio. In a batch reactor, the use of HZSM-5 catalyst led to a significant increase in the yields of volatiles (both gases and pyrolysis oil); moreover aromatization or isomerization effects have been observed.

Abstract: Precise kinetic models are required for the chemical recycling of polymer waste by pyrolysis to predict conversion and reaction rates, which are fundamental for developing a reactor model. This study evaluates the pyrolysis kinetics of three polymer wastes of different complexity: end-of-life tires, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene. For this purpose, thermogravimetric data obtained at three different heating rates were analyzed using two complementary approaches: 1) a single-step method combining isoconversional and master plot techniques, and 2) a multi-step distributed activation energy model. This work is crucial because it provides the first systematic comparison of fitted conversion and reaction rate curves against experimental data, filling a gap in the existing literature. The results show that the complexity of the feedstock influences the accuracy of the model: The distributed activation energy model outperforms single-step methods for end-of-life tires and correctly captures their multi-component degradation (complex matrix containing natural and synthetic rubber). On the other hand, Friedman/master plots work better for simpler polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, which contain ethylene glycol and terephtalic acid, and styrene, respectively.

Abstract: Thermal treatment can utilize polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in a high-value, eco-friendly method, but HCl generation and high oil chlorine content are key pyrolysis issues. Therefore, this research extensively characterized fast co-pyrolysis of PVC and high-alkali coal (HAC) using XPS, TG-FTIR-GC/MS, and GC-MS. This explored alkali metal catalysis and volatile reforming effects on Cl transfer and utilizing PVC as a hydrogen donor to improve the quality of pyrolysis oil. According to the GC-MS results, increasing the PVC ratio to 40 % raised monocyclic (MAHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to 59.1 % and 33.4 % respectively. However, co-pyrolysis of PVC and HAC inhibited the polyene reconstruction of the carbon skeleton, leading to a decrease of oxygenates, such as phenolic, acid, and ester. The XPS results showed that the inorganic chlorine in the solid product increased from 1 % to 66 % after co-pyrolysis at 600 °C, indicating the high fixed chlorine effect of HAC. Fast heating almost merges the PVC dechlorination stage with the conjugated polyene reconstruction stage, creating a liquid–gas synergy.

Abstract: Pyrolysis liquid is a valuable product that could be re-introduced into the refinery or petrochemical industry following circular economy principles. However, halogens in the liquid product hinder this approach by causing corrosion of subsequent technologies. Dehalogenation is, therefore, a necessary step that aims to reduce halogen content below the set limit of 10 ppm. Research on this topic often includes contradictory results, and dehalogenation is still not widely used in large-scale operations. The present study explores the possibility of chlorine removal from a model plastic mixture, including 10% PVC utilizing various pyrolysis conditions, stepwise pyrolysis, and sorbents based on Ca(OH)2, Fe3O4, and Fe. Results suggest that it is not suitable to use sorbents in-situ as the captured Cl in the form of chlorides was released at higher temperatures increasing the chlorine content in the liquid products. The limit of 10 ppm for refinery introduction was reached by combining stepwise pyrolysis and sorbents ex-situ.

Abstract: The present work deals with the thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE (low-density polyethylene) in lab-scale one- and two-stage test rigs over HZSM-5 catalysts featuring different acid site densities. In the first part of this work, the influence of catalyst-to-feed ratio and temperature (in conjunction with the acid site density of HZSM-5) on the product distribution was studied with an aim to identify the optimum operating conditions for the enhanced production of aromatics and light olefins. For this purpose, one-stage thermo-catalytic pyrolysis was performed in which catalysts were mixed with LDPE pellets for in-situ catalysis. In the one-stage catalytic pyrolysis, the catalyst sample with the highest acid site density gave the highest concentration of aromatics (ca. 55%) in the pyrolysis oil with a mono-aromatics fraction of over 50% that consisted mainly of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) compounds. The highest C2-C4 olefins concentration (ca. 65%) in the pyrolysis gas was obtained when the sample with the lowest acid site density was used. In the two-stage catalytic pyrolysis (ex-situ catalysis), the concentration of aromatics in the pyrolysis oil reached over 77% with a mono-aromatics fraction of ca. 72% that contained mainly BTEX compounds, when the most acidic catalyst was used. When the catalyst with the lowest number of strong acid sites was employed, the high content of C2-C4 olefins in the pyrolysis gas remained almost independent of the reactor configuration.

The yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolitic catalysts (HZSM-5>HUSY>HMOR) gave higher yield than non-zeolitic catalysts (SAHA≈MCM-41). Observed differences in product yields and product distributions can be attributed to the nature of catalyst and the reaction temperature.

Abstract: Despite the calorific value of plastic waste being comparable to that of fossil fuels, its direct utilisation in the internal combustion engine is not a viable option due to a technical difficulty in optimising the equivalence ratio.

Abstract: The utilization of microwave pyrolysis technology and CO2 dry reforming to recover high-quality products from waste plastics has become a research hotspot. In this work, light fuels were recovered by CO2-enhanced continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The balanced relationship between CO2 utilization and energy recovery was investigated, and the intrinsic pyrolysis mechanism was analyzed. Increasing the pyrolysis temperatures and CO2 concentrations helped to increase the pyrolysis gas yield and the syngas content, which were 96.44 wt% and 65.61 vol%, respectively.

Abstract: It is known that gas generated through plastic pyrolysis is abundant in hydrocarbons and can serve as a raw material for carbon nanotubes (CNTs).

A comparative evaluation was conducted between the upcycling process and the conventional process using methane as a carbon source, and each process was performed at laboratory scale. We report that the cost of the upcycling process (2,999 $ kg−1) is comparable to that of the conventional process (2,930 $ kg−1), and that this slight cost disadvantage can be mitigated by reducing the Ar flow rate by 20%. Upcycling process involving pyrolysis has a greater impact on climate change than conventional process.

Abstract: The valorization of post-consumer waste plastic in a refinery is an attractive initiative to avoid environmental problems caused by the poor plastic waste management. The modification of a bifunctional PtPd/HY catalyst through desilication (using NaOH) of the ultrastable HY zeolite has been carried out to upgrade waste plastic (high-density polyethylene (HDPE)) dissolved in a secondary refinery stream (vacuum gas oil (VGO)) through hydrocracking. Three different catalysts have been studied: the parent (Cat-A), undergoing a desilication cycle (Cat-B), and subjected to two cycles of desilication (Cat-C). The characterization techniques employed have been: N2 adsorption–desorption, TEM, ICP-AES, tert-butylamine-TPD, pyridine FTIR, WDXRF, XRD and TPO. The hydrocracking tests have been carried out in a semi-batch reactor at: 440 °C; 80 bar; catalyst to feed ratio, 0.1 gcat (gfeed)–1; HDPE to feed ratio, 0.2 gHDPE (gfeed)–1; and reaction time, 2 h. The products have been fractioned according to their boiling point range in: gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The composition of each fraction has been determined in terms of concentration of paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and (mono-, di- and poly-) aromatics. The results show that alkaline treated catalysts enhance the fuel production, with high HDPE and HCO conversions. The Cat-C (the one submitted to two desilication cycles) has displayed the greatest performance, reducing by half the gas yield and increasing the naphtha yield by 51 wt% respect to those obtained with the parent catalyst (Cat-A).

Abstract: The selective conversion of waste plastics into valuable chemicals, such as light olefins and single ring aromatics, was approached in an original fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor. The aim was the evaluation of the role played by temperature on product distribution and reaction mechanism in the steam cracking of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). Therefore, continuous runs were conducted between 675 and 800 ºC using a bed made up of inert sand. The reactor operated under vigorous spouting conditions to promote gas-solid contact and, at the same time, reduce the gas residence time. The proposed reactor design performs very well and is highly versatile to operate in a wide temperature range without operational problems. The steam cracking at 675 ºC led to partial conversion with a high oil fraction (44.9 wt%). The maximum yield of light olefins of 54.5 wt% was obtained at 700 ºC, with this yield steadily decreasing as temperature was increased. Cracking temperature had also an influence on the light olefin composition, with a marked decrease in the content of propylene and butenes and an increase in that of ethylene when temperature was raised. In addition, high temperatures also promoted the production of valuable single ring aromatics, i.e., a Benzene, Toluene and Xylenes (BTX) fraction yield of approximately 16 wt% was obtained between 750 and 800 ºC.

Aquathermolysis has emerged as a promising strategy for converting contaminant-rich polyolefin plastic waste into value-added liquid fuels. This study investigates the plastic-waste aquathermolysis potential of a TiO2 catalyst derived from the sacrificial precursor Ti-containing MIL-125 via a MOF-mediated synthesis pathway combined with calcination. The TiO2 catalyst retained its mesoporous properties and predominantly anatase phase on calcination at 450 ℃.

Additionally, the role of water in the N removal efficiency and coke suppression properties of the catalyst were analyzed. Water significantly improved the removal of N and S impurities, with a N reduction of 80–95% at the optimal water content (20–40 wt%). The robustness of the as-synthesized catalyst was confirmed by deconvoluted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy patterns, which indicated the persistence of the TiO2 phase, even after prolonged catalysis in aqueous environments, and transmission electron microscopy results, which showed that the anatase phase remained well-dispersed under aquathermolysis conditions with a significant reduction in the C/Ti ratio and a corresponding increment in the N/C ratio.

Abstract: Plastic waste management has become a vitally important environmental and economic concern for researchers and technologists worldwide. Currently, catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste emerged as a promising plastic waste management technique, further aiding the full-scale development of an alternate innovation to convert plastic waste into fuel (liquid oil) energy. Lately, zeolites have been one of the most suitable and versatile catalysts in converting plastic waste into fuel grade hydrocarbons via catalytic pyrolysis.

Abstract: The huge generation of plastic waste has become significant environmental problem. For environmentally sustainable plastic waste management, thermochemical recycling of widely used plastic waste such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate have vigorously studied. However, development of proper recycling process for other types of plastic waste is required. In this study, a thermo-catalytic treatment was applied for recovery of value-added monomers and gaseous products from polycarbonate (PC). The systematic study investigating the relationships between pyrolysis conditions (temperature, atmospheric gas, the presence of catalyst) and yield of value-added products was performed. To make the thermochemical process environmentally benign and more efficient, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as an atmospheric gas in comparing to inert gas (N2). When CO2 was introduced, the yield of PC monomer, bisphenol A (BPA), was nearly doubled at 600 °C. At higher temperature, BPA yield decreased with the increased yield of gaseous products. Because CO2 was the major gaseous product, BPA recovery from the PC pyrolysis was the useful approach in PC disposal practice. To improve BPA yield from PC pyrolysis, two MgO catalysts were utilized (medium porosity MgO-1 and ultrahigh porosity MgO-2). Catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 environment increased BPA yield from 12.8 (pyrolysis without catalyst under N2) to 25.6 (MgO-1) and 30.5 wt% (MgO-2) at 600 °C. High porosity MgO catalyst was more effective in BPA production, and the catalyst deactivation was not shown for 4 consecutive reactions.

Different chemical removers based on sodium, calcium and zinc bases, and different adsorbents based on alumina or zeolites were used inside the reactor or in downstream hot filters, respectively, for chlorine removal and upgrading of pyrolysis oils. Initially, polyolefin waste (POW, containing a 98.5 wt% polyolefins) was thermogravimetrically pyrolyzed to determine its thermal behaviour. Subsequently, chemical removers were mixed with the POW which was pyrolyzed at 480 °C in a semi-batch reactor. The adsorbents were tested separately in hot filters (300 ± 20 °C) downstream of the pyrolysis reactor. After the pyrolysis, the resulting char containing the chemical removers and the absorbents in the hot filters were analysed by FTIR, CHN elemental analysis and ESEM-EDS to determine their respective chlorine contents. The highest chlorine retention was 23.8 wt% for chemical remover when used in direct contact with POW, while a zeolite used in the hot filter (gas streams) gave a chlorine retention of 65.6 wt%. The pyrolytic liquids consisted of mixtures of C7-C40 hydrocarbons made up of olefinic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a very low presence of aromatics (estimated to be below 3 wt% by HPLC).

Abstract: Catalytic upgrading of plastics to valuable fuels and chemicals is an attractive route to valorize waste plastics. Herein, catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene was performed over γ-Al2O3 as a heterogeneous catalyst to produce fuel-grade hydrocarbons. The use of an inexpensive γ-Al2O3 catalyst and mild reaction conditions led to high liquid yield selectively in gasoline-range hydrocarbons which stands out from most of the work reported in the literature for polypropylene pyrolysis. The reaction conditions of pyrolysis were optimized by the Box-Behnken Design approach utilizing the response surface methodology. The highest liquid yield of 88.1 wt.% was obtained at 470 °C temperature, with 2 wt.% of catalysts and 5 h reaction time. The amount of solid carbon was insignificant (0.7 wt.%) and the gas yield was 11.2 wt.%. The γ-Al2O3 showed high efficiency and stability for converting polypropylene to liquid fuels. The catalyst was highly stable, reusable, and showed similar catalytic activity for 3 recycles. These features and the highly selective conversion of PP to gasoline range fuels are crucial for large-scale applications. The GC–MS analysis revealed that the liquid fuel produced mostly contained C8 to C15 hydrocarbons encompassing mostly gasoline and a small fraction of diesel fuel and higher hydrocarbons. The GC–MS data was also supported by SimDist analysis, which exhibited the boiling point ranging from 100 °C to 260 °C for the liquid fuel product. The reaction temperature and time had a significant impact on the liquid yield. The higher temperature favored the formation of the gaseous product of C1-C3 hydrocarbons. The NMR analysis showed that the liquid products mostly contained the highest amount of paraffins followed by olefins and a small fraction of aromatics. The presence of mild acidity in the γ-Al2O3 catalyst and optimum reaction condition provides favorable conditions to produce the highest yield of transportation fuel grade hydrocarbons without over-cracking into gases.",YES,YES,Single PP pyrolysis with detailed GC-MS and SimDist oil composition data showing C8–C15 hydrocarbons and gasoline-range boiling points.,SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: The adsorptive dechlorination of a pyrolysis oil coming from real plastic waste was investigated using different Na-zeolites (4A, 13X, and Y) as adsorbents. The dechlorination experiments were performed in a fixed bed trap under inert atmosphere operating at moderate temperatures (< 180 °C). The dechlorination efficiency of the adsorbents was significantly improved by performing a dehydration pre-treatment due to the removal of water molecules physisorbed on the zeolite surface. Among the zeolitic materials tested, 13X zeolite showed the best dechlorination efficiency, which was related to its high content of Lewis acid sites (attributed to the presence of Na+ cations ionically interacting with the zeolite framework), acting as chemisorption sites, as well as the high accessibility of the FAU-zeolitic topology to the Cl-containing compounds. For that sample, a detailed study of the adsorption temperature (from 30 to 180 °C) and time on stream (1–6 h) was further carried out. The maximum chlorine removal efficiency was achieved, reducing the chlorine content of the pyrolysis oil from 421 to 45 ppm, at temperatures of about 150 – 180 °C. Interestingly, under these conditions, thermal or catalytic cracking effects of the zeolite on the feedstock were not observed. However, the study of the time on stream showed that, after 3 h, the chlorine removal efficiency of the zeolite started to decrease. Thus, different regeneration treatments were evaluated proving that, after a combustion at 600 °C, the zeolite recovered its initial dechlorination efficiency.

Abstract: High-temperature gasification is an attractive alternative technology for clean energy production from plastic wastes and provides a sustainable pathway for their disposal. Waste cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) offers good potential energy recovery source because of its high energy density of around 47 MJ/kg that can be converted to syngas using pyrolysis or gasification. CO2 assisted gasification can provide clean and efficient syngas that can be converted further to valuable products. This can effectively decrease the carbon foot-print from the utilization of polyethylene wastes. This paper examines pyrolysis and CO2 assisted gasification of XLPE waste with focus on the kinetics, product yield and syngas yield properties (yield of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon) at different temperatures. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out to estimate the impact of the gasifying agent over pyrolysis. Pyrolysis and CO2 assisted gasification were conducted at several temperatures in the range 973 K to 1173 K in steps of 50 K. The results were compared with high-, medium-, low-density polyethylene as well as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Higher temperatures provided increased syngas yields from pyrolysis. The activation energy of pyrolysis from single-step kinetic analysis of TGA data revealed increases with an increase in branching and cross-linking. The reaction profiles of the single step of all the samples (except medium density polyethylene) were found to be closely represented by the Avrami-Erofeev models. Results also revealed that gasification generated more syngas, hydrogen, and energy than pyrolysis. Gasification consumed the CO2 to generate syngas with a mass-specific heating value similar to natural gas suggesting efficient utilization of both CO2 and XLPEs for clean and efficient energy production.",YES,NO,"Main focus is syngas and hydrogen production from XLPE via gasification, with no meaningful oil composition or yield data reported.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;TARGET_AROMATICS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: This study explores the co-pyrolysis recycling of the Polypropylene-Bakelite blend to improve the kinetics, thermodynamics, and conversion of thermal degradation of bakelite into useful products. The thermogravimetry analysis of the blend was conducted from ambient to 1000 °C at various heating rates in an N2 atmosphere. Thermogravimetric-Differential thermogravimetry curves revealed four steps of pyrolytic degradation, including two major weight loss steps (220–420 °C and 420–550 °C). The blending of polypropylene with Bakelite caused a shift in the pyrolytic degradation temperature zone and a synergetic effect. The pyrolytic degradation of the blended sample followed the F3 order-based mechanism with an average activation energy of 151 kJ/mol at 220–420 °C and the P3/2 nucleation mechanism with an average activation energy of 306 kJ/mol at 420–550 °C.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and low-rank coal is an important way to realize the recycling of plastic wastes and the clean and efficient conversion of coal. However, halogens released would cause equipment corrosion and affect tar quality when halogenated plastics were co-pyrolyzed with coal. For this reason, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as a representative of halogenated plastic, was co-pyrolyzed with Pingshuo coal (PS) in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The synergistic effect between PS and PVC and the migration behavior of chlorine were investigated, and the in-situ removal of chlorine during pyrolysis was explored by adding a CaO bed in the second stage of the reactor. The results showed that the addition of PVC in PS has a positive synergistic effect on tar yield with a maximum tar yield increment of 2.30 wt% at 30 wt% PVC, which is related to the negative synergistic effect on gas yield. Furthermore, the addition of PVC increases the content of 1–3 ring aromatics and decreases the content of aliphatics in the tar. The chlorine content in char and tar increases significantly with the increase of PVC addition. The addition of a CaO bed can significantly reduce the yield of HCl and the chlorine content in the tar. At 700 ℃, the dehydrochlorination efficiency of CaO can reach 78.1%. However, the CO2 produced by PS pyrolysis will reduce the dehydrochlorination efficiency of CaO, and this effect of CO2 can be reduced by increasing the temperature of the CaO bed.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with coal and no focus on pure plastic oil composition or fingerprinting.,CO_PYROLYSIS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Waste polyethylene was pyrolyzed using a process that combines auger reactor (AR) and fluidized bed reactor (FBR). This study primarily investigated the effects of the AR temperature, fluidized bed temperature, FBR freeboard temperature, and the type of fluidizing medium (steam vs. N2) on product distribution and light olefin yield. The most critical aspect of the process is the role of the AR. When the AR temperature is maintained at around 300 °C, the polymers inside the reactor melt. In this molten state, they are fed into the FBR, where pyrolysis takes place. Introducing polymers into the pyrolysis reactor in a molten, rather than solid state promotes their decomposition more effectively, resulting in enhanced production of light olefins. The experimental results confirmed this hypothesis. When the AR temperature was at 300–350 °C, the yield of C2–C4 olefins ranged from 50 to 52 wt%, which is up to approximately 8 wt% higher than the yield (44 wt%) obtained when the AR was unheated. The fluidized bed and freeboard temperatures were also found to influence gas production and the yield of C2–C4 olefins. In contrast, the choice of fluidizing medium had only a minimal effect on product distribution and light olefin yields. In conclusion, this study suggests that the AR-assisted steam pyrolysis process could serve as a straightforward method for the large-scale production of light olefins from plastic waste.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on light olefin production, with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of tire pyrolytic oil (TPO) blends on diesel engine performance, evaluate the techno-economic viability, and optimize the process variables using the response surface methodology (RSM) in order to increase the maximum product yield. To test engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics, the derived pyrolytic oil was employed in a four-stroke diesel engine with different diesel fuel blend ratios. It has been found that engine performance using a pyrolytic oil blend is much closer to the diesel fuel engine performance. This paper has briefly explored the economics of TPO production and the reliability improvements of the pyrolysis processes to make them viable for commercial applications. The techno-economic feasibility analysis has been conducted on a 10 tons'/day capacity pyrolytic plant. It has been found that the total cost and net revenue generation from one ton of scrap tires are $225.25 and $410.2, respectively. Additionally, the 8-year project's payback period is only 2.96 years, while the internal rate of return (IRR) was found to be 27.81%.

The effect of the catalysts to the pyrolysis oil properties and the in-situ upgrading (especially the storage, transportation and corrosion stability) of pyrolysis oil was investigated. High concentration of Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/SAPO-11 zeolites in catalyst mixtures can increase the yield of gases and pyrolysis oil, the concentration of aromatics or the hydrogen content in gases; however the presence of red mud in higher content can further increase the hydrogen concentration.

Four mainstream trolley case materials are selected in the study, and the main components are polypropylene (TC-PP), polycarbonate (TC-PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (TC-ABS), and PC/ABS blend (TC-PC/ABS). The pyrolysis behaviors under an air atmosphere with four heating rates are tested using a thermogravimetric analyzer, and the behavior under nitrogen with a heating rate is further tested for comparison. Two model-free methods are used to obtain the activation energy (E a), and the reaction mechanism of the target materials is characterized. Moreover, the pyrolysis products are analyzed coupled with an FTIR spectrometer. The thermogravimetric results show that the pyrolysis processes of the four materials in air and nitrogen atmospheres differed significantly. The E a of TC-PP, TC-PC, TC-ABS, and TC-PC/ABS obtained by the KAS method are in the range of 82.1–294.4, 93.7–394.2, 156.5–419.3, and 152.1–313.6 kJ·mol−1, respectively.

Abstract: The past COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the use of disposable masks, posing a significant environmental challenge due to the swift accumulation of waste. This study explores the potential of pyrolysis to transform this waste into valuable pyrolysis oil with characteristics akin to gasoline, addressing both waste management and energy derivation concerns. Pyrolysis, a thermal decomposition process, was applied to mask materials, producing an oil with a high calorific value of 45.93 MJ/kg. The chemical makeup of this pyrolytic oil was meticulously characterized using Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (PY-GC/MS) and Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), confirming the presence of hydrocarbons similar to those found in gasoline. Achieving an efficiency of 41.865 %, the pyrolytic approach demonstrated a promising potential for not only managing mask waste but also creating an alternative energy carrier. However, the study advises that before considering this pyrolytic oil for engine use, a thorough evaluation of its combustion quality, engine compatibility, and environmental impact is essential.

Abstract: Pyrolysis-catalysis of high density polyethylene (HPDE) was carried out in a fixed bed, two stage reactor for the production of upgraded aromatic pyrolysis oils. The catalysts investigated were Y-zeolite impregnated with transition metal promoters with 1 wt% and 5 wt% metal loading of Ni, Fe, Mo, Ga, Ru and Co to determine the influence on aromatic fuel composition. Pyrolysis of the HDPE took place at 600 °C in the first stage of the reactor system and the evolved pyrolysis gases were passed to the second stage catalytic reactor, which had been pre-heated to 600 °C. Loading of metals on the Y-zeolite catalyst led to a higher production of aromatic hydrocarbons in the product oil with greater concentration of single ring aromatic hydrocarbons produced. The single ring aromatic compounds consisted of mainly toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, while the 2-ring hydrocarbons were mainly naphthalene and their alkylated derivatives. There was a reduction in the production of multiple ring aromatic compounds such as, phenanthrene and pyrene. The addition of the promoter metals appeared to have only a small influence on aromatic oil content, but increased the hydrogen yield from the HDPE.

Abstract: Pyrolysis seems a promising route for recycling of heterogeneous, contaminated and additives containing plastics from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). This study deals with the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of a synthetic mixture containing real waste plastics, representative of polymers contained in small WEEE. Two zeolite-based catalysts were used at 400°C: HUSY and HZSM-5 with a high silica content, while three different temperatures were adopted for the thermal cracking: 400, 600 and 800°C. The mass balance showed that the oil produced by pyrolysis is always the main product regardless the process conditions selected, with yields ranging from 83% to 93%. A higher yield was obtained when pyrolysis was carried out with HZSM-5 at 400°C and without catalysts, but at 600 and 800°C. Formation of a significant amount of solid residue (about 13%) is observed using HUSY. The oily liquid product of pyrolysis, analysed by GC–MS and GC-FID, as well as by elemental analysis and for energy content, appeared lighter, less viscous and with a higher concentration of monoaromatics under catalytic condition, if compared to the liquid product derived from thermal degradation at the same temperature. HZSM-5 led to the production of a high yield of styrene (17.5%), while HUSY favoured the formation of ethylbenzene (15%).

SA4 silica alumina and three SA4/iron oxide combinations (γ-Fe2O3, a Fe3O4-C composite and α-FeOOH) were used for catalytic degradation.

SA4 catalyst used in liquid phase contact mode has a cracking effect on ABS degradation. The SA4/iron oxide catalytic systems give better results than the separate use of the catalysts, converting the heavy nitrogen (N)-containing compounds into light aliphatic nitriles that can be easily removed from the degradation oil by distillation.

Abstract: The current kinetic models for polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis contain many simplifications to reduce their size and the corresponding simulation time. Moreover, they are often based on rate coefficients determined using non-ideal experimental data featuring ambiguous process conditions with respect to mixing and temperature uniformity. The practical interest of PS pyrolysis is the production of styrene monomer to be reused as a feedstock in the polymerization of styrene. In the present work, a lab-scale tree-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model is presented that differentiates between 18 reaction families and 26 end-group pairs to study the product yield variations for thermal degradation of PS. Model parameters follow from Bayesian optimization to experimental data recorded with an in-house micro-pyrolysis unit coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. Low chain length (CL) anionic-made PS is specifically considered to gain an understanding of the role of specific end-groups. The experimental yields of the major products (monomer: 74.7–80.8 wt%, dimer: 5.1–5.5 wt%, trimer: 1.6–7.7 wt%) are well-predicted with the fine-tuned parameters. The main reaction pathway in the formation of styrene monomer is end-chain β-scission, while mid-chain β-scission is primarily involved in the formation of the styrene dimer and trimer.

Abstract: Not all plastics can be recycled mechanically. Polycarbonate (PC) combined with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is one such material used in applications like electronic casings and automotive components. Since mechanical recycling of PC/ABS results in thermal degradation and the loss of required properties, alternative methods are sought. Pyrolysis, the thermal decomposition without oxygen, preferentially cleaves certain bonds, yielding valuable monomers. This study investigates the pyrolysis of non-flame-retarded and flame-retarded PC/ABS blends at laboratory and pilot plant scales. Analyses utilized thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR). The blends exhibited two decomposition stages influenced by flame retardants. The IR spectra provided insights into the structural properties of volatile compounds. CO2 yield ranged from 6 % to 8 %, with the flame-retarded blend showing 0.5–1 % higher yields.

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of two different parameters on the different fractions obtained in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE using HZSM-5.

On the other hand, two different types of samples have been pyrolyzed at each heating rate: dry catalyst–polymer blend and melted blend (prepared in an extruder). The results obtained allow us to evaluate the influence of the contact effectivity between polymer and catalyst, as well as the effect of the type of heating on the product distribution. In general, catalytic pyrolysis leads to higher volatiles yields than thermal degradation and the pyrolysis of a melted blend reaches always higher yields than a dry blend. It seems than a better contact between polymer and catalyst implies a more noticeable activity of the catalyst although both parameters, heating rate and polymer–catalyst contact, are interconnected and the grade of influence of the type of blend used depends, in many cases, on the heating rate of the process.

Abstract: The preparation of bio-oil from cotton stalks and agricultural residue films using co-pyrolysis technology can achieve resource recovery and energy conversion, which has important research value and significance. In this study, cotton stalks were subjected to different chemical pretreatments using NaOH, HCl, and H2O solutions to understand their structural changes and pyrolysis characteristics. In addition, the lower H/C ratio of cotton stalks resulted in higher oxygen content in the pyrolysis oil, which limited its efficient and clean utilization. Therefore, the characteristics and pyrolysis kinetics of the pyrolysis products of pretreated cotton stalks and LDPE (low-density polyethylene) were studied. The results showed that the ash content of alkali pretreatment cotton stalks decreased by 1.24 %, and the dense structure of cotton stalks significantly relaxed. NaOH pretreatment effectively removed hemicellulose sugars and cracked them. During the co-pyrolysis process, when the ratio of NaOH-CS/LDPE was 50/50, the synergistic effect was more pronounced, and the oil yield increased by 2 % compared to the theoretical value. The oxygen content of CO and CO2 in the pyrolysis gas was higher than the theoretical value, at 10.4 % and 14.1 % respectively. The synergistic effect of bio-oil on hydrocarbons was the most significant, reaching 18.9 %.

Abstract: Thermochemical conversion in dual fluidized bed (DFB) systems is a potential alternative to the recycling of abundantly available plastic waste.

The presence of MC, XY, and AL does not exert significant influences on the distribution of types of pyrolysis products of PP, and the interaction of the three components with PS is conducive to the generation of styrene. The introduction of catalysts can increase the yield of hydrocarbons in the co-pyrolysis products of biomass components and plastics. The combination of MC (52.39 %)/XY (35.77 %), PP, and HZSM-5 is most beneficial for increasing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly due to the synergistic effect between MC/XY-derived oxygenates and PP-derived hydrocarbons through the hydrocarbon pool mechanism, the hydrogen transfer reaction, and the Diels-Alder reaction. For the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and PS, HZSM-5 shows significantly superior selectivity for mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, while HZSM-5/MCM-41 and MCM-41 obviously promote the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The research provides a reference for the preparation of high-quality bio-oils through oriented co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass components, no pure plastic-only condition with oil composition data reported.",CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: In this study, mixtures of peanut shells (B) and polypropylene (PP) were co-pyrolyzed in two configurations using spent fluid-catalytic-cracking (sFCC) catalyst. The feed ratio was varied to investigate changes in yields and selectivity. The ex-situ configuration generated a higher-quality liquid, less char and more gas yields (1.3 times on an average) than the in-situ mode. Both the operation modes produced similar aromatic compounds; however, the ex-situ bio-oil had a higher monoaromatic fraction. The ex-situ configuration showed more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at higher B and PP loadings, with a maximum yield of ∼44%C at B: PP ratio of 1:2. The ex-situ mode cracked polypropylene more efficiently to short-chain olefins (<C10). The dominant fractions were C9 and C12 in the in-situ and C9 in the ex-situ mode.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis is an attractive and promising way to recycle waste plastics. In this paper, AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt was used as the catalyst to pyrolyze waste polyethylene (WPE), and its catalytic activity was studied. Thermogravimetry (TG), gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were applied to investigate the pyrolysis behavior of WPE in the presence of AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt during the catalytic pyrolysis. Subsequently, the char separated from the pyrolysis residue were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), nitrogen adsorption and desorption testing, respectively. The results show that our strategy allows for the pyrolysis of WPE in the presence of molten AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt, which can not only reduce the initial pyrolysis temperature (below 200 °C) significantly but also play a key role in increasing the reaction rate. Accordingly, it is a safe and environmentally benign treatment of “white pollutions” by both reducing energy consumption of pyrolysis process and alleviating the environmental pollutions. Besides, another advantage of using the AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt as catalyst in pyrolysis of WPE is that the components of the heavy oil in the liquid products was much more reduced and no olefin was generated thus narrowing the composition distribution and improving their utilization value for further use. What’s more, the char separated from residue contains many pore structures with a BET surface area of 218-277 m2 g−1.

Abstract: An eco-friendly process to recover valuable materials deriving from silicon based photovoltaic panels at end-of-life has been proposed.

A preliminary mechanical treatment to remove fluorinated polymers allows to exclude dangerous emissions of hydrofluoric acid and fluorinated compounds coming out from conventional heat treatments. A subsequent thermal treatment allows the complete removal of the residual polymers and the separation of valuable materials.

Abstract: Polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis and gasification have been examined in a semi-batch reactor at temperatures of 700, 800 and 900°C. Characteristic differences between pyrolysis and gasification of polystyrene (PS) have been evaluated with specific performance focus on the evolution of syngas flow rate, evolution of hydrogen flow rate, evolution of output power, syngas yield, hydrogen yield, energy yield, apparent thermal efficiency and syngas quality. Behavior of PS under either pyrolysis or gasification processes is compared to that of char based sample, such as paper and cardboard. In contrast to char based materials, PS gasification yielded less syngas, hydrogen and energy than pyrolysis at 700°C. However, the gasification of PS yielded more syngas, hydrogen and energy than pyrolysis at 900°C temperature. Gasification of PS is affected by reactor temperature more than PS pyrolysis. Syngas, hydrogen and energy yield increased exponentially with temperature in case of gasification. However, syngas and energy yield increased linearly with temperature having rather a mild slope in the case of pyrolysis. Pyrolysis resulted in higher syngas quality at all temperatures. Kinetics of hydrogen evolution from the PS pyrolysis is introduced. The Coats and Redfern method was used to determine the kinetic parameters, activation energy (E act), pre-exponential factor (A) and reaction order (n).

Abstract: The recycling of plastic wastes is key to not only the development of circular economy, but also the safety of living environment.

The catalysts and carbon products were analyzed by XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, XPS, N2 physisorption, H2-TG, H2-TPR, TG-DSC and Raman.

Abstract: The production of H2-rich syngas from pyrolysis-catalytic gasification of plastic waste bottles has been investigated.

The different parameters (Ni loading, temperature, N2 flow rate and feedstock-to-catalyst ratio) have been investigated to optimise the H2 production. The catalysts were analysed by N2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was used to analyse the carbon formation on the used catalysts. The highest H2 production of 59.15 mmol g-1 of plastic was obtained in the presence of a catalyst with 20 wt.% Ni loading, which amounts to H2 purity as high as 54.2 vol% in gas production. Furthermore, 90.63 mmol g-1 of plastic of syngas was produced by increasing the feedstock-to-catalyst ratio to 4:1, yielding 84.4 vol.% of total gas product (53.1 vol.% of H2 and 31.3 vol.% of CO, respectively). The Ni-CaOCa2SiO4 hybrid-functional material is a very promising catalyst in the pyrolysis-catalytic gasification process by capturing CO2 as it is produced, therefore shifting the water gas shift (WGS) reaction to enhance H2 production from plastic waste. Detailed elucidation of the roles of each component at the microscale during the catalytic process was also provided through in-situ TEM analysis.

Abstract: One of the most promising ways to recycle plastic is pyrolysis. Valuable fuels and chemicals can be obtained by pyrolysis of waste plastic. In this study, pyrolysis of polypropylene was conducted using a novel continuous two-stage process equipped with auger and fluidized bed reactors connected in series. The auger reactor played an important role as an activator to elevate the vibrational states of molecules fed into the fluidized bed reactor. Hence, the two-stage pyrolysis conducted herein was called activator-assisted pyrolysis. In this study, the effects of the temperatures of the auger reactor (or activator) and bubbling and freeboard zones of the fluidized bed reactor, the type of the fluidizing medium (product gas and N2), and the residence time of pyrolysis vapor on the product distribution and composition were investigated. In the experiments, the activator facilitated decomposition of polypropylene molecules, resulting in a high yield of the product gases (81 wt%) consisting mainly of H2 and CH4. The maximum olefin (ethene, propene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes) yield was 52 wt%. The pyrolysis oil mainly consisted of aromatics (up to 92 wt%), particularly mono-aromatics. The activation energies of the activated and unactivated molecules were calculated using the Friedman and Flynn–Ozawa–Wall methods. The activation energy of the activated molecules was approximately 17 kJ/mol lower than that of unactivated molecules.

Key work lies in the organic template-free synthesis of fly ash-based ZSM-5 (FAZ) zeolites for catalytic reforming process of mixed plastics. The zeolites were subjected to ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis with simulated mixed plastic particles (MPP) from municipal solid wastes, and the liquid yield of FAZ-2–48h was 42.7 wt%, which was 1.3 times that of commercial ZSM-5. The selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the reformulated oil was 84.3 %, and the C6-C12 distribution was 98.01 %. The synergistic reaction between hydrogen-rich polymers (LDPE, PP) and hydrogen-poor polymers (PS) in the ternary hybrid plastics promoted the formation of liquids. The liquid yield of FAZ zeolite for the catalytic reforming of the actual hybrid plastics was 24 wt%, with a MAHs selectivity of 86.5 %, and the percentage of C6-C12 was 99.7 %.

Abstract: The volatiles generated from the pyrolysis of waste plastics undergo chemical reactions before being catalyzed to produce the plastic-derived oil. To reveal the relation between the oil properties and the volatile reactions, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene – a main component in waste plastics – were studied at volatilization temperatures of 300–600 °C with a volatilization time of 17.7–53.0 s in a two-stage reactor. The yield and composition of the oil in both thermal and catalytic reactions were investigated. It was found that in thermal pyrolysis, a high volatilization temperature favors the cracking of volatiles, resulting in the decline of carbon chain length and the decrease of the oil yield. Extension of the volatilization time favors the formation of light oil at a volatilization temperature above 400 °C, but produce more long-chain fractions at a volatilization temperature of 300 °C. The carbon number distribution of the oil after catalysis is independent on the conditions for volatile reactions, but the yields of the oil and each fraction after catalysis are higher at a lower volatilization temperature and shorter volatilization time.

Abstract: Recovery of high-grade copper from waste enameled wires can effectively alleviate the shortage of copper resources. In this paper, the evolution of pyrolytic products during pyrolysis of waste polyester imide enameled wires was analyzed and the thermal decomposition mechanism was presented. A technology consisting pyrolysis and ultrasonic was proposed to achieve deep decarbonization. The results showed that the pyrolysis process was mainly divided into two stages. Below 500 °C, polyester imide was first depolymerized into large monomer, and then pyrolytic oil containing ketones, imides, amines and aromatic compounds was generated by random fracture (three main ways) and free radical reactions. With increase of temperature, the free radical reactions of small molecules to produce carbon and pyrolytic gas were dominant.

Abstract: In this work real polypropylene (PP) waste plastic was used as a feedstock for synthesis of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) via a two-stage process. Lanthanum oxide (La2O3) was reported as a promising support for the active metals in thermocatalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons. This is due to the fact that it produces highly dispersed metal particles with an appropriate metal support interaction. Accordingly, La2O3 supported monometallic 50%Ni and bimetallic 40%Ni–10%Cu catalysts with the total metal content of 50 wt % were prepared and examined for the first time for the decomposition of non-condensable gases obtained from pyrolysis of PP to produce CNMs. The main target of this work is to study the impact of Cu addition on the yield and nature of as-deposited carbon product. The prepared catalysts were tested at the same pyrolysis and decomposition temperatures of 500 °C and 700 °C, respectively, and reaction time of 2.5 h. Various characterization techniques such as XRD, H2-TPR, BET surface area and FTIR were used to study the physicochemical properties of fresh catalysts. While, HR-TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and TGA-DTG techniques were employed on the spent catalysts to explore the nature, morphology, quality and thermal properties of CNMs product. It was observed that the bimetallic Ni–Cu/La2O3 catalyst exhibited higher surface area, higher metal dispersion as well as lower reduction temperature compared to the monometallic 50%Ni/La2O3 catalyst. These factors were found to be responsible for the improved catalytic growth activity of the 40%Ni–10%Cu/La2O3 catalyst in terms of carbon yield. The CNMs yield remarkably increased from 944% to 1458% after incorporating 10 wt% Cu in 40%Ni/La2O3 catalyst.

Abstract: This study investigates the pyrolysis behavior of two common medical waste polymers—polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)—through an integrated approach that combines thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and model-free kinetic analysis. The TGA/DTG results indicate that PP-based waste (e.g., surgical gown material) undergoes a single-step degradation at approximately 450 °C, producing negligible residual char. In contrast, PVC-based waste (e.g., gloves and tubing) demonstrates a two-stage mass loss: initial devolatilization occurring between 250 °C and 350 °C due to dehydrochlorination and plasticizer loss, followed by char breakdown at temperatures up to 600 °C. FTIR gas analysis reveals that the volatiles generated from PP pyrolysis are predominantly aliphatic hydrocarbons, characterized by strong C–H bands, while the pyrolysis of PVC releases significant amounts of HCl during the first stage and aromatic compounds in the second stage. Correspondingly, GC–MS analysis confirms that PP primarily yields hydrocarbons within the C5–C20 range, whereas PVC generates a variety of chlorinated and aromatic byproducts. The iso-conversional kinetic analysis indicates a relatively constant activation energy of approximately 200 kJ/mol for PP decomposition, contrasting with a two-phase profile for PVC, which exhibits lower apparent activation energies (ranging from 100 to 180 kJ/mol) during the initial HCl evolution and much higher values (exceeding 400 kJ/mol) during char decomposition.

Abstract: The possibility of using oil refinery facilities for treating streams derived from consumers’ society wastes, such as plastics, is gaining relevance in recent times. This strategy would cover two goals at the same time: (i) improve the management of wastes reducing the landfilling and incineration rates, and (ii) integrate the conventional oil industry within the circular economy. In this context, the hydroprocessing of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) blended (10 wt%) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) was investigated. In particular, four different NiW/HY catalysts were prepared and the influence of HY zeolite with different SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios (80, 30, 12, and 5.1) for producing automotive fuel-like fractions was studied. The catalysts were characterized in detail by several techniques to correlate their performance with their main physico-chemical characteristics.

Overall, it was obtained that highly acidic catalysts with a high concentration of Brønsted-type acid sites with moderate acidic strength rule the process, but these acidic properties must be endorsed by adequate textural properties in a matter of high specific surface and wide pore sizes. According to this, the NiW/HY12 catalyst offered the best performance, since the highest hydrocracking conversion and sulfur removal were achieved while the production of naphtha and light cycle oil fractions was maximized.

Abstract: Waste plastics, positioned between biomass and fossil fuels, hold great potential for valorization through upcycling technologies. However, it is still challenging to produce high-quality energy and chemicals from real-word commingling waste plastics. Catalytic pyrolysis demonstrates strong adaptability to mixed feedstocks, and the development of specialized catalysts is key to enhancing product quality. Among various catalysts, biochar-based catalysts stand out for their simple preparation and remarkable resistance to coke deposition. In this context, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics based on biochar-based catalysts was comprehensively and statistically analyzed by considering plastics feedstocks, pyrolysis reactors, reaction conditions, and catalyst development. This paper critically examines the mechanisms governing catalytic reaction during pyrolysis and analyzes the current challenges aimed at improving the yield and selectivity in the production of target products. In comparison to in-situ, the oil yield from ex-situ and microwave catalytic pyrolysis is notably higher. The coconut shell-based biochar with polymetallic modification under higher catalyst-to-feedstock ratios and lower reaction temperatures are more conducive to producing liquid oils. The free radical generation, carbocation reactions, and hydrogen transfer are the main mechanisms of waste plastics pyrolysis catalyzed by biochar-based catalysts. The Bronsted and Lewis acid centers on biochar-based catalysts, enhanced by biochar design, metal modification, and microwave heating, are key to determining the above reactions.

The results of this study offer a feasible route to co-produce hydrogen-rich gas and high-value light aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes…) from waste tires, by using inexpensive transition metal-promoted zeolite catalysts. 5Ni/USY tripled the hydrogen content of the product gas to 59.37 % and cut the C11+ fraction of the liquid phase by 70 % relative to the parent USY.

The temperatures of the pyrolysis process were varied between 360°C and 480°C, while the heating rates underwent changes, including 10, 15, and 30°C/min.

Abstract: Converting plastic wastes into value-added products through energy-efficient pyrolysis is essential, and it requires lower pyrolysis temperatures and shorter processing times than that of other processes. An exothermic phenomenon was observed during the process high-pressure polyethylene pyrolysis. It was proven for the first time that the exotherm is caused by a pressure-induced phase transition, in which colossal heat release can be driven by relatively small pressures. A large temperature change (> 100 °C) leads to the deep cracking of polyethylene, although the set temperature is far lower than the required temperature for thermal cracking. Importantly, the heat input stops immediately when the set temperature is reached; thus, the external heating time is short. Polyethylene can be completely converted into liquid products in ~90 wt% yield and with a small number of gases. The self-exothermic phase transition only occurs within a certain range of material thickness, which is related to the corresponding phase behavior. In the self-exothermic pyrolysis process, with an increase in the thickness of polyethylene, the proportion of low-value olefins in oil products decreases gradually, while alkanes, isoalkanes and aromatics show an increasing trend, making the product composition closer to the fuel standard.

Abstract: Recently, the hydrotreatment of plastic waste pyrolysis oils has been considered a promising route to remove heteroatoms and unsaturates from plastic pyrolysis oils to be used as steam cracking feedstock. As plastic waste pyrolysis oils differ vastly in composition from conventional crude oils, accurately identifying the different molecular species present in the mixture is essential to acquire further insights into their hydrogenation pathways. This work used gas chromatography coupled to a vacuum ultraviolet detector (GC-VUV) to obtain accurate quantification of (di)olefins compared to more conventional methods. It was found that there is no difference in intrinsic hydrogenation rates between diolefins and olefins, at least for chain lengths above C10. Moreover, an explicit dependency of the carbon chain length is identified on the hydrogenation rate for both olefins and diolefins with optimal hydrogenation rates up to C15. This is a consequence of the competition between hydrogenation and cracking reactions. Shorter unsaturated chains are thus formed because intrapore diffusional limitations prevent the hydrogenation of larger species. In addition, the degree of substitution (non-branched, methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, etc.) of the unsaturated molecules mattered concerning the hydrogenation rate. Linear olefins were more rapidly hydrogenated than branched components. Apart from hydrogenation, skeletal isomerization reactions are also important, especially at high olefin conversions. These fundamental insights demonstrate the capability of GC-VUV to analyze hydrotreated plastic pyrolysis oils and provide essential knowledge for designing and optimizing the hydrotreatment processes of plastic waste pyrolysis oils.",NO,NO,"The study focuses on hydrotreatment and hydrogenation pathways of pre-existing pyrolysis oils, not on experimental plastic pyrolysis or oil composition from raw plastic feed.",NO_LAB_EXPERIMENT;NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA

Abstract: Three molecular sieve-based catalysts, HZSM-5, HUSY, and Al-MCM-41, were employed in the catalytic pyrolysis of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer. The on-line synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) together with pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to evaluate the performances of these catalysts in the catalytic pyrolysis processes, especially their denitrogenation ability on the pyrolysis oil.

In contrast, although large amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be formed over Al-MCM-41, little effect was exhibited on the yields of major products owing to its inferior acidity. Given the relative production of light nitrogenous compounds, it can be concluded that HUSY is more applicable to the denitrogenation than HZSM-5.

Abstract: This work focuses on regeneration of coked catalysts using ozonation as an alternative process to typical coke combustion with oxygen. Different samples of coked ZSM-5 zeolites obtained during catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene at 450 °C were exposed to an ozone enriched stream in a fixed-bed reactor. The influence of main operating parameters (time of exposure, temperature, O3 inlet concentration and gas volumetric flowrate) were studied by evaluating coke removal efficiency and by observing regeneration behavior both at pellet and reactor scales. These experimental results led to a better insight of the diffusion–reaction phenomena occurring during the process. Diffusion limitations were illustrated thanks to an innovative method, the analytical acquisition of carbon radial profiles on catalyst pellets, while the apprehension and quantification of competing reactivity (thermal, catalytic and oxidation) gave a better understanding of the ozonation process. Time of exposure and temperature were found to significantly affect carbon removal efficiency, while inlet ozone concentration and flowrate influence were respectively moderate and null in the investigated range. Similarly to combustion, coke ozonation is driven by a balance between diffusion and reactivity, leading to the appearance of a mix of known regeneration regimes depending on the operating conditions: homogeneous and shrinking-core.",YES,NO,Catalyst regeneration study with no focus on or reporting of oil composition or liquid product data from plastic pyrolysis.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: This study proposes a strategic principle to enhance the thermal efficiency of pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW). An environmentally sound energy recovery platform was established by suppressing the formation of harmful organic compounds evolved from pyrolysis of MSW. Using CO2 as reaction medium/feedstock, CO generation was enhanced through the following: 1) expediting the thermal cracking of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) evolved from the thermal degradation of the MSWs and 2) directly reacting VOCs with CO2. This particular influence of CO2 on pyrolysis of the MSWs also led to the in-situ mitigation of harmful organic compounds (e.g., benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) considering that CO2 acted as a carbon scavenger to block reaction pathways toward benzenes and PAHs in pyrolysis. To understand the fundamental influence of CO2, simulated MSWs (i.e., various ratios of biomass to polymer) were used to avoid any complexities arising from the heterogeneous matrix of MSW.

Abstract: Coke evolution on a Y-zeolite based catalyst and its influence on the active site and catalytic activity during catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene for fuel oil were investigated.

Abstract: Factorial Design Methodology (FDM) was developed to enhance diesel fuel fraction (C9–C23) from waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and Heavy Gas Oil (HGO) through co-pyrolysis. FDM was used for optimization of the following reaction parameters: temperature, catalyst and HDPE amounts. The HGO amount was constant (2.00g) in all experiments. The model optimum conditions were determined to be temperature of 550°C, HDPE=0.20g and no FCC catalyst. Under such conditions, 94% of pyrolytic oil was recovered, of which diesel fuel fraction was 93% (87% diesel fuel fraction yield), no residue was produced and 6% of noncondensable gaseous/volatile fraction was obtained. Seeking to reduce the cost due to high process temperatures, the impact of using higher catalyst content (25%) with a lower temperature (500°C) was investigated.

Abstract: Microwave catalytic cracking of waste plastics is a promising technology.

This study has focused on the heat transfer performance and reuse of microwave absorber and the influence of heating strategies on cracked products.

Abstract: Pyrolytic conversion of chlorine-containing mixed plastic (CMP) wastes into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) suffered the chlorinated pollutants and low product yield, making it difficult for continuous industrial operation. Herein, a novel method of tandem catalytic pyrolysis of CMP coupled with hydrothermal pretreatment (HY) for the clean production of high-yield MAHs was investigated. The pyrolytic kinetics of the feedstocks obtained after HY was analyzed, and the synergistic mechanism of HY and tandem catalysis over carbon-based catalyst (Fe/Ni/Mo@N/C) and zeolite (HZSM-5) was established. The results showed that the homogenization effect of HY on CMP was the key to improving its catalytic activity. High pretreatment temperature effectively weakened the branch-chain bond of the polyolefin molecules and dramatically reduced the pyrolytic activation energy of CMP.

Abstract: The source reduction of plastic waste could be an effective means to attenuate hazardous environmental problems triggered by microplastics. Energy recovery from plastic waste through thermochemical processes is a desirable valorization route. To realize the grand challenges, plastic waste derived from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) was pyrolyzed.

As such, fundamental and systematic works were conducted to delineate the CO2 effects on conversion of VMs. This study experimentally proved that CO2 promotes thermal cracking in line with C–C bond scissions. However, the reaction rate for the conversion of CO2 and VM into CO via homogeneous reaction was not fast. Therefore, a Ni-based catalyst was employed to accelerate the reaction rate. However, there was coke deposition on the catalyst surface. To prevent coke formation, we chose a method to enhance CO2 reduction to CO and the oxidation of VM.

Abstract: End-of-life tires are an increasingly important environmental burden. Since retreading is only partly possible, safe and economic methods of disposal need to be developed. Pyrolysis of ELTs, and subsequent upgrading/application of the produced energy carriers, is considered a valuable treatment method. In order to design the process, numerous operation units have to be taken into account. Char, vapour and gas are formed in the reactor. The char is purified from ZnO with a leaching process. The pyrolysis vapour is separated into a condensable fraction (oil) and a non-condensable fraction (gas) thanks to a cross-flow condenser with air as indirect cooling medium. The remaining gas is compressed to 6 bar: a part of it is continuously converted in electricity for process use, while another part is stored for power generation at peak demand time. A flowsheet of the process is established and environmental and assessment of investments and production are discussed. For the pyrolytic treatment of 3 ton/hr of ELTs, the required heat for the reactor is 271 kW at 380 °C, provided by electrical heating elements. A reactor volume is determined for a residence time of about 6 h. For the cross-flow condenser, indirectly air-cooled, a heat-transfer area of about 13.2 m2 is required.

The char cooler requires a heat-transfer area of 10.2 m2, when indirectly cooled by water. Operating parameters of the leaching and subsequent recovery of Zn2+ complete the design.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising method for delamination and recycling of end-of-life (EoL) photovoltaic (PV) modules. To provide theoretical support for process optimization, the thermal evolution of ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) is focused on. Besides the conventional characterization of TG-MS, Py-GC/MS, and in situ DRIFT, perturbation-correlation moving-window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) analysis were used to understand the effect of physical perturbations and the correlation of the functional group variations, respectively. The results indicate that the pyrolysis of EVA involves the melting stage (60–280 ℃), the first weight loss stage (280–430 ℃), and the second weight loss stage (430–530 ℃). At the melting stage, some acetic acid and its derivatives are generated, followed by the emergence and re-formation of the esters. It suggests the phase separation and surface segregation of the polyvinyl acetate segments. The evolution of functional groups at the first weight loss stage is dominated by the rearrangement while the devolatilization plays a minor role. At the substage of 280–350 ℃, it mainly occurs the transformation of ester groups to acetic acid with the release of some secondary small molecules. The decarboxylation into volatiles is delayed by the H-bonds and concentrated at the substage of 350–430 ℃. The second weight loss stage is dominated by the release of alkenes with ∼77 % weight loss. Consequently, a three-step pyrolysis strategy is proposed for PV modules delamination at ∼280 ℃, acetic acid separation at ∼430 ℃, and alkene production at ∼530 ℃.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on functional group evolution and thermal behavior of EVA using advanced spectroscopy, with no reported oil composition or yield data for the liquid product.",HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The valorization of waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) for hydrogen production has been studied in a two-step process, comprising pyrolysis and subsequent steam reforming of the volatiles produced in the first step. Particularly, this work focuses on the deterioration mechanisms (sintering and coke deposition) of the Ni commercial catalyst used in the second step, as it conditions the overall process performance. Pyrolysis of HDPE has been performed in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500°C, and the catalytic steam reforming of the pyrolysis volatiles, in a fluidized bed reactor at 700°C. Deactivated catalyst samples were recovered at different values of time on stream, and characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM and TEM electronic microscopies, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), Raman, FTIR and LDI-TOF MS spectroscopies. The results show that the deactivation is due to the sintering and encapsulation -by coke- of Ni.

Abstract: Landfilling is viewed nowadays as a serious threat associated with various burdens and stressors on the urban environment. To date, there is little information available on actual value of landfilled waste namely plastic solid waste (PSW) resulting from mining operations. In this work, PSW reclaimed from an active unsanitary landfill site (MAB) has been studied with the aim of determining its thermal profile and degradation behaviour for future utilisation in thermo-chemical conversion (TCC) processes. The materials were characterised by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in accordance with internationally approved test methods in a simulated pyrolytic environment. In addition, chemical analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to study the nature of the materials reclaimed. The degradation kinetics of the reclaimed PSW were studied with the aim of determining the apparent activation energy (Ea) of the pyrolytic reactions. The Ea values determined ranged from 199 to 266 kJ mol−1 which is in-line with pyrolytic reactions applicable for future use in fuel recovery units. TGA showed a clear shift in thermograms indicating a clear change in the degradation mechanism. The physico-chemical studies conducted on the materials also favours TCC treatment over other conventional end of life options such as physical (mechanical) recycling or incineration.

Abstract: Plastic waste (PW) is currently one of an environmental threat. Despite the increasing share of recycled plastics, their disposal remains high. Therefore, there is a high demand for new PW management systems. Among them, pyrolysis combined with dry reforming (PCDR) is an advantageous solution because it allows for resource recovery in the form of gas and liquid fuels, with simultaneous utilization of CO2. To date, catalysts based on Ni, Co, and noble metals supported on metal oxides have been examined. However, these catalysts suffer from quick deactivation due to coking and sintering. Therefore, testing other materials for PCDR is of particular importance. In this regard, Ni-WC/Al2O3 and Ni-WC/MgWO4/MgAl2O4 were investigated as potential PCDR catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by BET, BJH, XRD, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, SEM, TEM, TG and DTG. The catalytic activity was evaluated in a two-step PCDR process using low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and simulated waste plastic (SWP). The structure of the polymer strongly determines the yields of gas, liquid, and solid products. The highest yield of synthetic gas generation was observed for Ni-WC/MgWO4/MgAl2O4 and was 48.20 ± 2.41 mmol/gp. Different origins of the structural changes including oxidation or coking were observed for different plastics. PCDR of PET led mainly to oxidation, LDPE to the coking deposition.

Abstract: The viability of pyrolysis technology for chemical recycling of plastics is challenged by the presence of PVC in real-world mixed plastic wastes. This study aims to investigate catalytic stepwise pyrolysis as a pretreatment step to remove chlorine from PVC-containing plastic wastes prior to further processing. TG-FTIR and Py-GCMS analysis as well as experiments on a lab-scale pyrolysis system were conducted to study the influence of key processing parameters on the pretreatment including temperature, heating rate, and catalysts. Py-GCMS results indicated 300 °C to be the best pretreatment temperature in terms of balancing Cl removal and avoidance of organochloride formation. Metal oxides, i.e., CaO and Fe2O3, mainly acted as adsorbents of HCl gases with little cracking effect, and their adsorption effects are positively correlated with alkalinity. ZSM-5 catalysts promoted the release of HCl, and the dechlorination effect was more pronounced with ZSM-5 of higher acidity. In contrast, in the lab-scale pyrolysis system, 350 °C pretreatment achieved the highest HCl generation ratio, i.e., 43.60 %. The addition of zeolite catalyst significantly reduced the content of organochloride in the pyrolysis oil in contrast to the performance of metal oxides, but also absorbed most HCl instead of promoting HCl release as in Py-GCMS tests. Mass balance analyses revealed that the majority of chlorine was retained in the solid residues following the catalytic stepwise pyrolysis process, with the notable exception of Fe2O3.

Abstract: The exponential increase in global plastic production, coupled with the limited efficiency of current recycling technologies, calls for innovative and scalable waste management solutions. Catalytic pyrolysis has emerged as a promising method to upcycle plastic waste into valuable chemicals and fuels. However, a major challenge remains in efficiently converting complex municipal plastic waste into valuable downstream products, which requires improving the product distribution toward the aromatic fraction, particularly benzene, toluene, and xylene compounds (BTX), which hold significant value in refinery operations. BTX are key building blocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of polymers, solvents, detergents etc. Their recovery from plastic waste not only adds economic value but also supports circular economy goals by reducing reliance on fossil-derived aromatics. This study addresses these challenges by designing and evaluating catalysts with tailored acidity and hierarchical pore structures to enhance the productivity of BTX. A comparative analysis was performed on the microporous zeolites (HZSM5), mesoporous catalysts (mesocellular foams, MCF), and hierarchical variants synthesized via top-down modifications, benchmarked against an equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst for BTX production. Feedstock characterization revealed a heterogeneous composition with a substantial inorganic fraction, highlighting the need for robust catalytic systems. Systematic evaluation reveals hierarchical zeolite and zeolitized mesocellular foams, outperforming conventional catalysts by balancing acid site concentration with pore accessibility.

Abstract: Large quantities of physiological saline and polyvinyl chloride fragments constitute the primary sources of chlorine within medical waste.

Free radicals from fibrous dehydration aided plastic scission and lignin cleavage, while polymer melt inhibited secondary fiber reactions.

The time at which defluidization occurred was correlated to the ratio between the bed solids hold-up and the polymer feed rate by means of linear relationships.

Abstract: Heavy hydrocarbon residue management has always been an environmental issue; thus, it is essential to find a method for upgrading heavy oils and plastic waste to high quality products as an alternative source of chemicals and fuels. In this study, the microwave catalytic pyrolysis (MCP) of heavy oil (HO) and LDPE (as plastic source) was proposed by employing a unique design of the catalyst, SiC foam@HZSM-5. This special catalyst design provided sufficient mass and heat transfer and enhanced the available catalyst surface area during the pyrolysis process. The effect of microwave power and the HO:LDPE ratio were investigated to optimize the product yield and quality. The results showed that the hazardous and unwanted elements of HO were eliminated by adding LDPE to the feedstock. More importantly, it was observed that the secondary and side reactions were accelerated due to a positive synergistic effect ( Δ Y ), which occurred because of hydrogen donors from the LDPE degradation and the non-thermal effect of microwave heating. The HO:LDPE ratio of 1:1 with a microwave power of 800 W and 10 min heating time were the optimum conditions; the liquid yield was about 42 wt% with around 90% of aromatics (mono- and polycyclic) relative concentration.

Abstract: Switching from a linear mode of waste management to a circular loop by transforming plastic waste into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a promising approach to current plastic waste treatment. One of the many applications of CNTs is its use for electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution. Existing methods of CNTs-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode fabrication involve additives like polymeric binders and additional steps to improve CNT dispersion, which are detrimental to the CNT structure and properties. The in-situ fabrication approach can potentially be a one-pot solution to HER electrode synthesis. In this study, polyolefins pyrolysis gas and a Co:Ni:Mg catalyst were used to fabricate binder-free CNTs-based electrodes on different substrates for HER. The study assessed CNT quality on conductive carbon paper, semiconductive silicon, and dielectric glass substrates, evaluating their HER performance in 1 M KOH. A mixture of hollow-core, bamboo-like, and cup-stacked arrangement nanotubes were synthesized on the substrates, with CNTs on glass and carbon paper substrates possessing better graphitization than CNTs grown on silicon. This is in agreement with HER performance, whereby the as-prepared electrodes required overpotentials of 267 mV, 241 mV, and 216 mV for silicon, glass, and carbon paper, respectively, to achieve 10 mA/cm2. Despite being poorly conductive, the glass substrate electrode achieved a lower overpotential than the silicon electrode. Additionally, the as-prepared silicon electrode faced a delamination issue likely attributed to the lower surface energy of the silicon substrate surface, demonstrating the weaker adhesion between the CNTs and silicon surface. The proposed approach thus showed that the in-situ fabricated electrodes performed better than separately synthesized CNTs prepared into electrodes by 27.4% and 14.2% for carbon paper and glass substrates, respectively. The improved performance of the as-prepared, binder-free electrodes can be linked to the lower charge-transfer resistance and reduced contact resistance between the CNTs and substrate.",YES,NO,"Main target is CNT synthesis for hydrogen evolution reaction, with no focus on oil composition or liquid product characterization.",TARGET_CNT;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: To enhance the quality of raw bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of biomass, hydrogen-rich reactants such as waste plastics, cooking oils, and soap stock are frequently incorporated into the fast catalytic co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of biomass. Nevertheless, widespread uses of acids, bases, and zeolite catalysts must address concerns such as easy to coke, regeneration challenges, and environmental impacts. In this study, one green carbon catalyst is derived from nanocellulose (NCCC) and then firstly applied to co-pyrolyze the Douglas Fir (DF), a typical lumber species in North America, together with low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a commonly used plastic. The use of NCCC during feedstock co-pyrolysis boosted the formation of aromatics, particularly the mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in bio-oil and H2-rich gaseous products, with a selectivity of H2 to 65 vol.%, nearly double the selectivity without catalysts. Even after five consecutive applications, the NCCC still displays good catalytic effectiveness in the co-pyrolysis: its selectivity for H2 in gaseous products (48 area%) after five-time usage is virtually equal to that without catalysts (46 area%). Moreover, the mechanism of the NCCC application was investigated by applying the NCCC in a co-pyrolysis of LDPE and DF, along with their individual pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 450 to 800 °C. This research investigated the potential catalytic impacts of NCCC in co-CFP process, aiming to provide an affordable, eco-friendly heterogeneous catalyst to replace existing acid/base catalysts in the conversion of biomass.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with biomass and no focus on pure plastic oil composition or fingerprint data.,CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Infrared-fast pyrolysis (IF) has proven effective for examining the co-pyrolysis behavior of polyethylene (PE) and corn stover (CS) by optimizing secondary reactions. In this study, a fixed-bed reactor with fast infrared heating was adopted to explore the distribution of pyrolysis products and compare the product compositions generated by IF with those produced by electric-conventional slow pyrolysis (ECS). Increasing the PE ratio first increased the oil yield and then reduced it at 600 °C during the co-pyrolysis process by IF. The maximum oil yield produced by IF in PE50%-CS50% was 1.6 times the calculated yield, whereas the oil generated by ECS were roughly comparable to the calculated amount. Owing to the sluggish heating rate in ECS, the pyrolysis volatiles experienced a prolonged residence time in the high-temperature area, resulting in a severe secondary reaction and large variations in H2 and CO2 content. The highest H2 content in PE75%-CS25% was 18.09 vol%, which was 3.4 times the calculated value. The lowest CO2 content was 45.7 vol% in PE50%-CS50%, which was 27% less than predicted. During IF, The phenols, ketones, acids, aldehydes, and polyaromatic rings gradually decreased as the PE ratio increased, while the alcohol and ester content initially increased and then decreased. The alcohol reached a maximum content of 57.3% in CS50%-PE50%, while the ester reached a maximum value in PE25%-CS75%. The increased PE content produced a large number of hydrogen radicals that accelerated the hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions of phenols and furans.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass (corn stover) without separate pure plastic conditions, leading to distorted oil fingerprints.",CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: To reduce the pollution during the pyrolysis recovery of chlorine-containing plastic waste from different sources, effects of the interaction between different plastics and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on the transformation of chlorine at low temperature were investigated by thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) and fixed-bed pyrolysis experiments. Results showed that the proportions of chlorine in chars were all <0.04 %, indicating that almost all chlorine was released after pyrolysis. However, the chlorine forms in volatiles were significantly changed with mixing different plastics. HCl production was significantly inhibited due to the addition of other plastics, while the organic chlorinated compounds (OCCs) formation was promoted, which increased the distribution of chlorine in liquid products. During PVC pyrolysis, chlorine was mainly distributed in gas (93.09 %) in the form of HCl, only a small amount of aliphatic chlorides were generated and distributed in liquid (6.89 %). After the addition of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the chlorine distribution in liquid increased to 8.86 %, 11.98 % and 25.99 %, respectively. The formation of OCCs was significantly affected by the difference in thermochemical reaction characteristics of plastics. Specifically, the production of aromatic chlorides was promoted by PS, while the generation of aliphatic chlorides and aromatic chloroesters was significantly promoted by PE and PET, respectively. Therefore, the release form of chlorine could be significantly altered by the interaction between PVC and other waste plastics, which provides a reference for the regulation of chlorine-containing pollutants in the recovery and utilization of plastic waste.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on chlorine distribution and transformation in volatiles during co-pyrolysis of PVC with other plastics, with no detailed oil composition or fingerprint data reported.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The global presence of plastic debris has become an indisputable environmental issue. While it is useful to recycle used plastic materials, contaminated plastics require a series of pretreatments prior to the process. Here, we offer a viable thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) platform to directly valorize fishing net waste (FNW). Prior to the pyrolysis of FNW that was collected at a Korean seaport, its chemical composition (polyethylene) was examined using thermogravimetric analysis, ultimate analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Pyrolysis of FNW was conducted to produce value-added syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) in both CO2 and N2 environments with a variety of pyrolysis setups. The pyrolysis temperature significantly contributed to the thermal cracking of long-chain liquid HCs into H2 and C1-2 HCs under the N2 and CO2 conditions. In the presence of cobalt-based catalysts, an additional improvement of the reaction kinetics for producing H2 and C1-2 HCs was shown in the N2 environment. However, the synergistic effectiveness of Co-based catalysts and CO2 resulted in CO formation, because CO2 provided additional C and O sources over the Co-based catalysts. Thus, it allowed control of the H2/CO ratio in the CO2 and N2 atmospheres. The compositional matrix of the liquid HCs after pyrolysis also confirmed that CO2 controlled their aromaticity. Thus, the CO2-cofeeding pyrolysis of FNW can be considered a viable platform for the direct treatment of plastic wastes by harvesting energy as a form of syngas.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbon production with CO2 co-feeding, and the liquid hydrocarbon product is not the main focus or characterized in detail.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The effect of co-cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or its pyrolysis wax together with vacuum gasoil (VGO) has been studied. The aim is to determine the content, nature, and location of coke while analyzing the impact on product distribution in the process. Four different feeds were used (VGO, VGO + 5 wt% HDPE, VGO + 20 wt% of wax, and 100 wt% wax) in experiments performed in a laboratory-scaled riser simulator, with similar conditions to those of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit: equilibrium catalyst; 530 °C; catalyst/feed mass ratio, 5; contact time, 6 s. The results of the different characterization techniques of the deactivated catalyst and the coke indicate that the catalyst fouling decreases notably by incorporating these waste streams, changing its nature to a more aliphatic (olefinic) one and its location towards the zeolite micropores. On the contrary, the coke formed from the VGO is more evolved and mainly constituted by polyaromatic components deposited on the mesopores of the catalyst matrix. Product distribution is also affected, increasing the yield of light cycle oil and keeping a relatively similar gasoline yield, with greater olefinity and lower aromaticity.

Microwave pyrolysis is a simple and efficient technique with better heating uniformity and process controllability than conventional heating. Compared with PVC pyrolysis, the addition of SW significantly reduced CO2 yield and greatly increased the yield of CO. The yield and quality of pyrolysis oil were effectively improved by SW, and the content of chlorine-containing compounds in the oil was suppressed to <1% at low temperatures (<550 °C).

Abstract: Enhancing the pyrolysis of Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) through torrefaction effectively removes impurities, preventing equipment corrosion and improving product quality. ASR, mainly composed of plastics, rubber, foam, and fabric in varying ratios, exhibits torrefaction and pyrolysis behaviours influenced by complex interactions among these components, which contribute to process outcomes that exceed the additive effects of individual components. To further elucidate the interaction mechanisms during the integrated torrefaction and pyrolysis process of ASR, this study analyzed the product properties of ASR with varying component ratios during this process. Our findings reveal that the interactions among the typical components of ASR enhance reactions between volatiles and char, boosting the polymerization of volatiles into char. This interaction increased char yield by over 6.0 wt% compared to the sum of individual components and enhanced the formation of large aromatic structures within the char. The melting of plastics over semi-char caused continuous volatile accumulation, further boosting polymerization, while foam’s porous structure enhanced volatile-char contact, promoting this process. Conversely, rubber and fabric produced more char and oxygen-containing radicals, promoting the secondary polymerization of volatiles.

Abstract: Among the two pyrolysis methods, the two-stage type gives better results than the single-stage in converting mixed municipal solid waste (MMSW) into synthetic oil (O-Synthec) and gaseous products (G-Synthec). However, the double energy supply for the heating process in the first and second reactors needs to be considered in terms of efficiency. Therefore to complete the research of two-stage pyrolysis, this study improvised a two-stage co-pyrolysis process supported by a Long Fixed-Bed Catalytic Insert (LFCi) attached to the inner wall of the reactor. In the test, 500 g of MMSW with 8 components was fed into a reactor with LFCi containing a dolomite natural catalyst. The co-pyrolysis process was carried out at a temperature variation of 400–550 °C, and the best results obtained were used as a reference for variations in reaction time from 120 to 210 min. Based on the physical and chemical properties, the co-pyrolysis O-synthec and G-synthec products were subjected to Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) analysis and American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) standard to physical properties test. The results were compared with those of one-stage pyrolysis, direct catalytic and without catalyst.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes is a promising way for their conversion into valuable products. By modulating the catalyst properties and operating conditions, it is possible to direct the product distribution to obtain oils that may be suitable both as fuels and as chemicals. However, the efficient and safe removal of the halogens, often contained in plastic wastes, remains as a great challenge. In this work, the catalytic behaviour of ZSM-5 zeolites in the pyrolysis of a real chlorinated plastic waste of the electric and electronic equipment sector (WEEE), consisting of PE with about 3.4% of PVC, was investigated. To that end, three zeolite samples with different acidity and accessibility were synthesized and assayed. A thermal pre-treatment was applied to the plastic waste at 350 ºC, which allowed a chlorine removal of 87% from the WEEE feedstock. The pyrolysis tests were carried out in a downdraft fixed-bed stainless steel reactor, with a catalyst/feedstock ratio of 0.2, at temperatures of 600 ºC and 450 ºC in the thermal and catalytic zones, respectively, of the reaction system. In comparison with thermal pyrolysis, that mainly produced waxes, the product distribution changed considerably by contacting the pyrolysis vapours with ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to a strong enhancement in the yield of oil and gases.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis is an important direction for the high-value conversion and utilization of biomass and plastics. Research on the mechanisms underlying synergistic effects contributes to the regulation of co-pyrolysis processes and enables targeted production of products. The synergistic effect is primarily determined by the physicochemical properties of the feedstocks as well as chemical reactions occurring during pyrolysis. This study designed co-pyrolysis experiments with varying mass transfer processes, aiming to classify and identify physical and chemical changes in co-pyrolysis from a reactive perspective, thereby obtaining methods for regulating the co-pyrolysis process. The research findings indicate that solid-phase contact and reactions between gas phase and solid phase are major factors influencing pyrolytic behavior and variations in pyrolytic products, independent of feedstock types. The type of feedstock affects specific reaction processes. In terms of thermal weight loss, both PP and PET can facilitate the pyrolysis of cellulose, but the molten PET, due to its higher viscosity, can encapsulate cellulose, preventing the release of volatile components and promoting secondary reactions. Regarding surface structure characteristics of biochar, the main difference between the two plastics lies in the hydroxyl group content. PETV can reduce the hydroxyl group content on the biochar surface through esterification reaction, while also fixing itself on the biochar surface, thereby increasing the biochar yield. PPV primarily reacts with unsaturated structures such as carbonyl groups, increasing the hydroxyl group content. As for the liquid phase products, both plastics can promote the deep decomposition of CE, producing more small molecular substances. This synergistic effect primarily originates from the interaction between plastic volatiles and CE.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with biomass (cellulose) and no clear reporting of pure plastic oil composition data.,CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Developing effective catalysis to address end-of-life Nylon pollution is urgent yet remains underdeveloped. Nylon-6 is a resilient synthetic plastic and a major contributor to ocean pollution. Here, we report a metallocene catalytic system based on earth-abundant early transition and lanthanide metals that mediates Nylon-6 depolymerization at unprecedented rates up to 810 (ε-caprolactam)·mol(Cat.)−1·h−1 at 240°C in ≥99% yield. This solventless process operates with catalyst loadings as low as 0.04 mol % at temperatures as low as 220°C—the mildest Nylon-6 depolymerization conditions reported to date. This metallocene catalysis can be carried out in a simulated continuous process, and the resulting ε-caprolactam can be re-polymerized to higher-quality Nylon-6. Experimental and DFT analyses identify effective depolymerization pathways involving catalytic intra-Nylon-chain “unzipping” assisted by π-ligand effects and inter-chain “hopping.” A robust chelating ansa-yttrocene is particularly effective in depolymerizing diverse commodity end-of-life articles, such as fishing nets, carpets, clothing, and plastic mixtures.",NO,NO,The study focuses on catalytic depolymerization of Nylon-6 to monomer (ε-caprolactam) rather than pyrolysis oil production.,NO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_AROMATICS

Abstract: The study investigated the kinetic, thermal, and thermodynamic behaviors of the co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene.

WCO showed complete degradation in Phase 1(300–435 °C), whereas W3P1 showed a maximum degradation of 60.19 wt% among the mixtures at the same phase. The maximum weight loss temperatures for all the WCO-WP mixtures in Phase 2(435–510 °C) were found to be lower than that of WP. The correlation coefficient for diffusion models was 0.95–0.98, suggesting it to be the most probable reaction mechanism for WCO- WP co-pyrolysis. The activation energies of the mixtures for diffusion models were found to range from 103.33 to 122.66 kJ/mol and 73.42–258.88 kJ/mol in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively.

Abstract: Nitrogen-doped activated carbon catalysts (NAC) were prepared via a two-step process involving the co-carbonization of coconut shell and urea, followed by activation with KOH. These NAC were then employed in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of corn stover (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using a fixed bed reactor. The characterization results demonstrated that nitrogen doping led to a larger specific surface area, an enhanced microporous structure, and abundant nitrogen-containing functional groups, which facilitated the production of liquid and promoting the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics (MAHs). The introduced pyridinic-N and pyrrolitic-N provided sufficient active sites for deoxygenation, cracking, aromatization, and Diels-Alder reactions of co-pyrolysis vapors that augmented the formation of MAHs, as well as high calorific value syngas including H2, CH4, and C2+ hydrocarbons. The highest MAHs yield of 62.41% was achieved at a urea to coconut shell ratio of 0.8, whereas an excessive amount of urea resulted in cyclization and polymerization reactions of MAHs to form polycyclic aromatics (PAHs). Accordingly, controlling temperature and catalyst to raw material ratios enabled further regulation of the production and selectivity of MAHs.

Abstract: The sustainable utilization of agricultural residues and waste plastics to mitigate environmental pollution, while generating renewable energy through pyrolysis has achieved significant attention through the years.

With an intention to avoid pulverization of the feedstocks to fine particle sizes, a unique configuration resembling a chocolate is adopted to mix the biomass pellet with sheets of PPW, while using activated carbon as a susceptor. The calorific value of the co-pyrolysis oil was higher (30–35 MJ kg−1) than the pyrolysis oil obtained from RSP (22–28 MJ kg−1). The maximum oil yield from co-pyrolysis was 40 wt% for a feed-to-susceptor ratio of 2.5:1 w/w, 10 % PPW at 600 °C, and 800 W microwave power. Compared to the pyrolysis of RSP, co-pyrolysis resulted in significant deoxygenation in the oil fraction (50–60 %).

Abstract: Packaging plastic waste consisting of low and high-density polyethylene and polypropylene were pyrolyzed in a lab scale semi-batch reactor at a very slow dynamic condition (1 °C min−1). Gaseous and liquid products were collected at regular intervals starting from their inception during the degradation process.

Abstract: Quantifying trace levels of microplastics in complex environmental media remains a challenge. In this study, an approach combining field collection of samples from different depths, sample size fractionation, and plastic quantification via pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) was employed to identify and quantify microplastics at two public beaches along the northeast coast of the U.S. (Salisbury beach, MA and Hampton beach, NH). A simple sampling tool was used to collect beach sand from depth intervals of 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm, respectively. The samples were sieved to give three size fractions: coarse (>1.2 mm), intermediate (100 μ m–1.2 mm), and fine (1.2 μ m–100 μ m) particles. Following density separation and wet peroxide oxidation, a low-temperature solvent extraction protocol involving 2-chlorophenol was used to extract polyester (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyamide (PA), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The extract was analyzed using Py-GC–MS for the respective polymers, while the solid residue was pyrolyzed separately for polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). The one-step solvent extraction method significantly simplified the sample matrix and improved the sensitivity of analysis. Among the samples, PET was detected in greater quantities in the fine fraction than in the intermediate size fraction, and PET fine particles were located predominantly in the surface sand. Similar to PET, PS was detected at higher mass concentrations in the fine particles in most samples. These results underscore the importance of beach environment for plastic fragmentation, where a combination of factors including UV irradiation, mechanical abrasion, and water exposure promote plastic breakdown.

Abstract: Polychloroprene (PCP) rubber is mostly mixed in industrial solid waste (ISW) as the main source of chlorine element. Whereas, the products formation and chlorine behavior during the pyrolysis are insufficiently illustrated for this typical chlorinated polymer, which is not conducive to the chlorine regulation of ISW pyrolytic products.

Importantly, 30–65 wt% chlorine was found to be migrated to gas and tar, respectively. Compared with PVC, the differences of chlorine distribution between PCP and PVC may be attributed to the easier cyclization with a longer molecular chain. Also, the release temperature of HCl acted as main component determines its availability for the subsequent formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. In details, the conversion pathway from chlorinated limonene to Cl-aromatic hydrocarbons was confirmed and the reaction was found to be enhanced at higher temperature and heating rate. By analyzing the content of tar components (especially at low heating rate), it was found that the major formation pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons was supposed to be the direct Diels-Alder reaction of monomer rather than the dechlorination of intermediate chlorinated limonene.

Abstract: This study investigates the thermal decomposition kinetics and mechanisms of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Kinetic parameters were determined using model-free methods, including Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), as well as the model-fitting Coats-Redfern (CR) method. PVC was dehydrochlorinated in a fixed-bed reactor at 300–450 °C, followed by pyrolysis at 550 °C using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS). In fixed-bed experiments, gaseous products and chlorine-containing species were characterized using a gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors (GC-TCD/FID), and oxygen bomb combustion-ion chromatography (OBC-IC). The structural evolution of char was examined through elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The raw PVC was also pyrolyzed with Py-GC/MS at 300–550 °C to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Results revealed a two-stage thermal decomposition pathway for PVC, with the activation energy for the first stage (131.477 kJ·mol−1) was notably lower than that of the second stage (199.409 kJ·mol−1), indicating that defect structures initiate dehydrochlorination. At lower temperatures during fast pyrolysis, raw PVC undergoes dehydrochlorination, releasing HCl and forming short-chain conjugated polyenes. As temperature increases, the dehydrochlorination rate accelerates, forming longer conjugated polyene chains that rapidly cyclize and aromatize into bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, the two-stage process, comprising low-temperature dehydrochlorination in a fixed-bed reactor followed by pyrolysis via PY-GC/MS, facilitates the development of a more extensively crosslinked structure during the initial stage. Upon subsequent thermal treatment, the crosslinked network undergoes further cracking and structural rearrangement, forming aliphatic hydrocarbons and more polycyclic aromatic compounds, particularly tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",YES,NO,"PVC pyrolysis study focuses on kinetic mechanisms and char/organic gas evolution, with no clear reporting of liquid/oil composition or yield data suitable for fingerprinting.",NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: The resource recovery based on pyrolysis has become the mainstream disposal method for polyolefin plastics in recent years.

To address these problems, molten salts thermal treatment was performed to conduct targeted regulation of the process.

The findings revealed that X influenced the carbon yield of NiMo-X catalysts and the morphology of the resultant carbon nanomaterials. Notably, NiMo-Ca demonstrated the highest carbon yield, whereas NiMo-Mg and NiMo-Ba exhibited the lowest. Furthermore, NiMo-Mg tends to produce clean and thin CNTs, while NiMo-Ba tends to yield carbon flakes with numerous irregular cokes.

Specifically, NiMo-Mg generated a high CO2/CH4 environment, while NiMo-Ba exhibited slower catalytic cracking of polymeric chains from face masks, both of which were unfavorable for CNTs growth. Conversely, NiMo-Ca facilitated higher carbon recovery, likely due to its creation of a low CO2/CH4 environment via CO2 methanation.

In this paper, energy recovery from waste blends (sewage sludge (SS), polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP), paper rejects (PR), and waste tyres) was tested through laboratory-scale co-pyrolysis. For each co-pyrolysis test, 7 l of waste blend in different ratios were used. The results of pyrolytic oil and gas analyses show valuable compounds and chemical materials recovered. The detailed analyses show the effects of co-pyrolysis parameters, especially the ratios of waste blends with respect to the process temperature of 600°C, on the pyrolytic gas and oil. The highest volumes of gas (0.66 m3) and oil (699 ml) were obtained from sample 5_8 (PES:SS:PR). Waste blend 15_1 (LDPE:SS) had the highest gross calorific value (GCV) of 43.82 MJ/m3 in gas, and had the highest proportion of flammable components (46.31% of methane). Sample 5_8 had the highest calorific value in pyrolytic oil (45 MJ/kg) and sample 5_3 had the lowest (28.113 MJ/kg), which is comparable to coal. High-quality pyrolytic gas and oil were obtained with average GCV of 44 MJ/m3 and 40 MJ/kg respectively, where the average GCV of the most calorific fossil fuels is 43.6 MJ/kg in crude oil and 34 MJ/m3 in natural gas. We conclude that co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and waste is a convenient and simple method of waste disposal under a synergetic effect of efficient waste management, energy production, and reduction of dependence on fossil fuels.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with sewage sludge and other waste types, without clear data on pure plastic oil composition.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: To date, the recycling of polyurethane (PU) and polyisocyanurate (PIR) waste still poses a significant problem. Within this contribution, the thermal degradation of high-resilient ether PU, semirigid PU, rigid PU, and (PIR) with and without TCPP flame retardant was studied at different temperatures to identify and quantify the main products. For this, a tandem micropyrolyzer coupled to GC × GC with FID and ToF-MS detectors was used, and the yield volatiles, light gases, and residue was quantified. The volatile pyrolysis vapours obtained from pyrolyzing high-resilient ether PU and semirigid PU at 600 °C were very similar, and the main products obtained were ethylene and propylene (combined yield of ~13 wt%), ~16 wt% of various oxygenates, and 4–6 wt% organic nitrogen compounds. The oxygenates included mostly poly-ether type compounds with varying molecular weight, and these are attributed to the decomposition of the polyol chains forming the soft segments of the polymer. The main semi-volatile nitrogen compound was 4,4′-methylenedianiline, attributed to the decomposition of the hard segments in the PU structure synthesized from MDI. The pyrolysis vapours from rigid PU contained several ether-type compounds and high yields of heteroatom-free monoaromatics—in particular styrene. The PIRs were more difficult to decompose and volatilize than the PUs, resulting in ~20 wt% higher residue yields. The charring propensity was even higher in the absence of a flame retardant in the formulation. Pyrolysis of TCPP-containing PIR produced Cl-containing pyrolysis vapours such as allyl chlorides. While the yield of H2O was comparable for the different PUs and PIR, pyrolysis of PIR produced higher yields of CO2 and less CO compared to the different PUs. The use of catalysts can help to convert PU waste pyrolysis vapours more efficiently to desirable chemicals.",YES,YES,"Rigid polyurethane pyrolysis with detailed GC×GC-FID/ToF-MS analysis of oil products, including quantified yields and identification of key compounds like styrene and oxygenates.",SINGLE_PLASTIC;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;GENERAL_CATALYST

Abstract: In thermal treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), oxygen-induced low-temperature pre-dechlorination coupled with hydrogen-assisted Cl capture in subsequent pyrolysis was proposed as an economical and competitive way for the inhibition of chloroaromatics. Dechlorination and pyrolysis processes were experimentally investigated, and formation of chloroaromatics in both processes was quantitatively compared, using PVC as the model. Due to the low bond energy of CCl, most of Cl released at low temperature, ahead of common volatiles, providing a feasible temperature window for the pre-dechlorination of feedstock. Chlorobenzene and benzyl chloride were the major chloroaromatics in pyrolysis product, formed at 300 °C and higher temperature. Therefore, dechlorination should be proceeded below 300 °C to prevent the generation of chloroaromatics from itself. However, under inert atmosphere, dechlorination efficiency was heavily dependent on temperature, being poor at 250 °C and 275 °C. O2 had a clear inductive effect on low-temperature dechlorination, lowering the peak temperature of HCl release to 234 °C. After a 30 min oxygen-induced dechlorination at 250 °C, 97.525% of Cl in feedstock was removed, and chloroaromatics in the subsequent pyrolysis was reduced by 90.2%. For a further inhibition of chloroaromatics, 2% H2 was introduced for in-situ Cl capture in the pyrolysis of pre-dechlorinated feedstock, as a result, no chloroaromatic was detected.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on chloroaromatics inhibition during PVC pyrolysis, with no reported oil composition or liquid product fingerprint data.",TARGET_AROMATICS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: A series of bimetallic CoMo/MgO catalysts with different total metal contents from 10 up to 60 wt% and a fixed Co/Mo weight ratio of 4/1 were prepared and employed for the first time to transform real low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials through a two-stage process. The waste was thermally cracked at 500 °C to non-condensable gases which then decomposed over CoMo/MgO catalysts at 700 °C to obtain the desired products. Both fresh and spent CoMo/MgO catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, FTIR, Raman, BET, TEM, and TGA techniques. The results showed that the catalytic activity and stability were increased with the successive increase of CoMo content up to 40 wt%. Both 30CoMo/MgO and 40CoMo/MgO catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity where more than 90% H2 yield was obtained. This behavior could be attributed to the excessive formation of different types of mixed oxide species such as MgCoOx, CoMoOx and MgMoOx as shown from XRD, TPR and Raman results. In fact, the presence of these species enhances the dispersion and stabilization of Co and Mo particles in the catalyst matrix, resulting in improved catalyst performance.

Abstract: This study examined the thermogravimetric pyrolysis behaviour of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles using catalysts like ferrocene (F), red mud (RM), a Ni/Cu/Mo multicomponent catalyst on kieselguhr, and ferrocene-red mud mixtures, with or without hydrogen peroxide. Heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min were used. The Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) models determined activation energies (Ea), which were lower with catalysts compared to pure PET (189 kJ/mol). The lowest Ea (53 kJ/mol) was achieved with hydrogen peroxide, resulting in complete pyrolysis and no char. SEM analysis of the resulting char showed micro carbon rod (MCR) formations. The best catalyst can be chosen based on the needs of the final product. For example, if MCR creation is the goal, ferrocene and red mud may be the best choice; if full pyrolysis is the goal, H2O2 may provide the greatest result. The thermodynamic analysis, including ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS, indicated that the enthalpy values for catalyst-containing PETs are lower than those for pure PET.

Abstract: A bench scale, two-stage, thermo-catalytic reactor equipped with a continuous feeding system was used to pyrolyse pure and waste plastics. Experiments using five zeolitic and clay-based catalysts of different forms (pellet and powders) and different plastic feedstocks – virgin HDPE, HDPE w1aste and mixed plastic waste (MPW) were compared to the control experiments – pyrolysis without catalyst. Results indicated that the two pelletized catalysts were the most promising for the conditions employed. Of these two, one with higher acidity and surface area was highly selective for the gasoline fraction (C5–C11) giving 80% from the total medium distillate conversion using virgin HDPE as feedstock. It also produced the least amount of olefins (17% for virgin HDPE, 4% for HDPE waste and 2% for MPW) and coke (<1% for virgin HDPE, 3% for HDPE waste and 5% for MPW), and the highest aromatics content (22% for virgin HDPE from un-distilled medium distillate, 5% for HDPE and 13% for MPW both from distilled medium distillate). The second pelletized catalyst exhibited high selectivity for the diesel fraction (C12–C25) giving 63% from the total medium distillate conversion using virgin HDPE as feedstock. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst surface depended mainly on the mesopore volume, with less coke deposited as the mesopore volume increased.

Abstract: Waste plastics contain a substantial number of valuable chemicals. The wastes from post-consumer as well as from industrial production can be recycled to valuable chemical feedstock, which can be used in refineries and/or petrochemical industries. This chemical recycling process is an ideal approach in recycling the waste for a better environment. Polymer cracking using a laboratory fluidised bed reactor concentrated on the used highly contaminated catalyst, E-Cat 2. Even though E-Cat 2 had low activity due to fewer acid sites, the products yielded were similar with amorphous ASA and were far better than thermal cracking. The high levels of heavy metals, namely nickel and vanadium, deposited during their lifetime as an FCC catalyst, did not greatly affect on the catalyst activity. It was also shown that E-Cat 2 could be used with and without regeneration. Although there was more deactivation when there was no regeneration step, the yield of gases (C2–C7) remained fairly constant. For the first time, these results indicate that “waste” FCC catalyst (E-Cat) is a good candidate for future feedstock recycling of polymer waste. The major benefits of using E-Cat are a low market price, the ability to tolerate reuse and regeneration capacity.",YES,NO,The study focuses on catalyst reuse and regeneration with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data.,NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is one of the most widely used plastics in the world. When PVC is heated, HCl will form, causing equipment corrosion, product quality decline, environmental pollution and other problems. Therefore, more attention is paid to recycling of PVC than other plastics. In this study, the reaction mechanisms of PVC with different metal oxides (MO x : CaO, ZnO, CuO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3) at low temperature (310 °C) were compared, with focus on chlorine capture and dehydrochlorination product (De-Cl PVC) property. The results showed that when the radius of metal ion was smaller, the extrapolated onset temperature (Ti ) of PVC-MO x pyrolysis tended to be lower, such as PVC-ZnO, PVC-CuO and PVC-Al2O3. Direct reaction of PVC and MO x was deduced for PVC-CuO and PVC-ZnO pyrolysis, based on the lower Ti and peak temperature (T max) than that of PVC pyrolysis. MO x that did not significantly lower T max was supposed to react with HCl that dissociated from PVC. The addition of ZnO significantly reduced the release of HCl (0.5%) and captured 97.6% of chlorine as inorganic chloride salts. However, the chloride salts produced from PVC-MgO pyrolysis could decompose at low temperature, thus releasing HCl again, and the C atoms in PVC-CuO system could react with copper chloride salts and H2O, to form and release HCl. The capture effects of chlorine by Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were not good. With addition of MO x , all De-Cl PVCs were rich in C=C-H and (C)3C-H structures.

Abstract: Plastic waste is a promising resource for producing liquid fuels that can be integrated into existing hydrocarbon infrastructures. However, the heterogeneous nature of plastic-derived liquid fuels limits direct application in internal combustion engines, necessitating their refinement into a usable form. To address these issues, this study explored the enhancement of combustible gaseous fuels derived from plastic waste, footwear waste, as a viable alternative. This approach involves the introduction of carbon dioxide as a reactive feedstock during the pyrolysis process. Analytical techniques were employed to precisely determine the types and compositions of four polymers present in footwear waste. The compositional matrices of the primary pyrogenic products were also identified. However, incorporating carbon dioxide into pyrolysis leads to its interaction with volatile compounds, converting them into lighter gaseous products, particularly carbon monoxide. The homogeneous reactivity of carbon dioxide was further enhanced by the application of heat and a nickel-based catalyst. The gaseous product yield from catalytic pyrolysis in the presence of carbon dioxide increased proportionally with the test temperature. Specifically, the use of carbon dioxide led to a 1.92-fold increase in gaseous product yield at 700 ˚C, in reference to the results from nitrogen.

Abstract: This study was aimed to investigate the effect of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the pyrolysis of polylactide composites (PLA4042D/rGO) prepared in solution. GC-MS analysis of PLA4042D/rGO pyrolysis products showed that introduction of rGO into the composition with PLA leads to a significant change in the ratio of main degradation products.

Abstract: Thermocatalytic co-pyrolysis of agro-forestry residue and LDPE waste was used to improve aromatic-rich bio-oil with combining CeZrAl and HZSM-5 dual catalyst. The influence of pyrolysis parameters on pyrolysis characteristics, kinetics, aromatic yield and selectivity was investigated; the synergistic effect and additive effect for promoting aromatic hydrocarbons with and without catalysts were determined based on the experimental and theoretical hydrocarbon content; and the reaction mechanism was also described by analyzing the free radicals.

Abstract: The growing amounts of plastic waste and CO2 emissions are two environmental threats that require urgent attention. Pyrolysis combined with dry reforming (PCDR) is a technology that allows both CO2 utilization and resource recovery from waste plastic. New catalysts for PCDR are crucial for developing efficient and stable processes that can be widely implemented in the industry. In this study, Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts modified using different transition metal (Ti, Mo, W) carbides were investigated in the PCDR of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) with emphasis on syngas yield, H2/CO ratio, product distribution, and catalyst deactivation. In addition, the effect of reforming temperature and process pressure was investigated. The catalysts were characterized using H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, N2 physisorption, XRD, TEM, XPS and TGA. The combined characterization and activity tests demonstrated that modification with different metal carbides affects the structure and activity of Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts in relation to product yields, syngas composition, and catalyst stability. The investigation revealed that modification of nickel catalysts with different transition metal carbides enables manipulation of syngas composition, which is of great importance because different industrial processes require synthesis gas with different H2:CO ratios. Moreover, mixed outcomes were observed when different plastic feedstocks were used in the PCDR, indicating that different metal carbide-modified catalysts may be suitable for the process depending on the feedstock used. Regarding the effectiveness of synthesis gas production and catalyst stability, the most promising catalyst was the Ni-TiC/MgAl2O4 catalyst. According to the obtained results, modification with TiC resulted not only in increased synthesis gas production but also in reduced carbon deposition in PCDR of both LDPE and PS.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on syngas production and catalyst performance for dry reforming, with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Plastic production and usage increase every year due to its practicality, adaptability, and low-cost production. The problem with plastic arises when it becomes waste and needs to be treated. Most of the plastic we use is produced from petrochemical material that can be used in resource recovery processes like pyrolysis to produce various materials. One of the pyrolysis process products is pyrolytic oil, whose properties are similar to conventional fuels. Minor differences in fuel properties can influence the injection process, in-nozzle flow condition, spray formation and break-up, the combustion process, etc. The presented paper aims to study the influence of pyrolytic oil‘s properties on cavitation formation in the injection nozzle of a common-rail injector. First, the pyrolytic oils were obtained from waste high- and low-density polyethylene using a pyrolysis reactor. Afterwards, the oils were characterized and implemented in the AVL FIRE computation program for studying their influence on cavitation formation in the injection nozzle hole. The obtained results indicate slight differences in fuel properties that influence cavitation formation and spread in the injection hole, which further influence conditions at the exit of the injection hole. The lower lower viscosity of pyrolytic oils influences lower friction in the fuel nozzle flow.

Conducting pyrolysis at steady state allowed observations on the behavior of polymers during thermal degradation. Based on collected information about reaction rates and the composition of pyrolysis products as well as of reactor content we could distinguish between the random and the chain-end scissions of polymer macromolecules and we showed that porous silicalite favored the later ones. Although silicalite had no acid reactive centers, it influenced the equilibrium attained at steady state and changed the composition of pyrolysis products. As a result, the rate of double bonds formation strongly increased with the silicalite amount; however the mass rate of pyrolysis was not significantly affected. The macroscopic mechanism for the thermal degradation of polymer explained why the amount of silicalite does not contribute to the improvement of the mass rate of volatilization.",YES,NO,The study focuses on mechanistic insights into chain-end scission and product equilibrium rather than reporting detailed oil composition or quantitative oil yield data.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Two mechanisms of defluidisation were identified and the time at which defluidisation occurred was measured and correlated to a key variable of the process.

It was found that the flame retardants had small effect on the composition of pyrolysis oils: 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)ethane increased the unsaturated compounds of PhCC type to the detriment of ethylbenzene. Contrary, the synergist had more remarkable effect on the pyrolysis of HIPS-Br. Decomposition started faster giving lower amount of gases, oils with higher density and more pyrolysis residue.

Abstract: A massive challenge in handling and disposing the polymeric waste, generated by the growing human population and continuous development, has been faced currently as a result of human negligence. Fortunately, among many methods to deal with the problem of increasing polymer debris in the environment, pyrolysis stands out due to its efficiency and accessibility. In the present study, automobile plastic scrap (APS) and tyre crumb rubber (TCR) materials as a combination were subjected to co-pyrolysis using a novel catalyst (NOVC-FZP) that was synthesized using ferrocene and zeolite as precursors.

Abstract: Hydroconversion has been demonstrated as a viable method to efficiently deconstruct polyolefins under relatively mild conditions. The hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds over Ru-based catalysts can convert polyolefins into liquid alkanes and methane. To suppress methane generation and obtain high-value isomer, further exploration of the mechanism for the cooperative deconstruction of polyolefins by bifunctional catalysts with metal–acid sites is necessary. In this study, we utilized ball milling to enhance the accessibility of acid sites within MOR zeolite, while the fragmented pore structure ensured that the loaded Ru metal was sufficiently accessible for long-chain alkanes. The sequential accessibility of metal–acid sites boosted the hydroconversion efficiency of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Through systematic investigations involving catalysts with various Ru loadings and Si/Al ratio of zeolites, it is discovered that the smaller-sized Ru particles not only facilitate the generation and desorption of olefinic intermediates in hydrocracking but also promote the hydrogenation and desorption of alkyls and suppress the cascade of terminal C–C bond cleavage in hydrogenolysis. Liquid fuel (C5-C21) yield was increased by 27% for the catalyst loaded with 0.7 wt% Ru on mMOR20 compared to 1.7 wt% loadings, while methane yield was only one-third of the latter. Concurrently, the distribution of acid sites on the zeolite surface affected the aggregation process of Ru atoms.

Abstract: Raw natural clinoptilolite from the Slovak deposit in Nižný Hrabovec and clinoptilolite treated with solution of hydrochloric acid (0.1 M) were used to promote cracking of polypropylene (PP), as a representative of the second most common plastic in municipal waste, into valuable gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons. The influence of catalyst was studied using two-stage cracking apparatus. The process consisted of batch semiflow thermal cracking reactor connected to flow catalytic reactor operating at 450 °C. The cracking activity of fresh, unregenerated and regenerated clinoptilolite was studied. The cracking activity into gaseous hydrocarbons was the highest with fresh catalyst (28.1 % for raw and 53.4 % for acid-modified catalyst). It represented an increase of 11.3 % and 36.6 %, respectively, in comparison with thermal cracking. The content of valuable methylpropene in gas was markable (up to 27.1 wt %). It was confirmed that catalytic cracking of PP with unregenerated and regenerated catalyst was also effective although the cracking activity of those catalysts slightly decreased.

Abstract: Biogenic impurities are common contaminants of plastic waste. This study investigated the effects of biogenic impurities on the conversion of a polyolefin mixture (6 wt% low-density polyethylene, 24 wt% high-density polyethylene, and 70 wt% polypropylene) into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and hydrogen via pyrolysis-chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Biogenic components from diverse sources were added to the polyolefin mixture, including lignocellulosic materials (pine sawdust, coconut coir pith), biosolids from wastewater treatment (municipal sewage sludge), animal-based waste (crustaceans), and bio-based plastic (polylactic acid). At contamination levels up to 9.1 wt%, 3 out of 5 impurities (coconut coir pith, sewage sludge and crustaceans) caused a decline in the conversion efficiency of feedstock into MWCNTs (33 ± 7% for polyolefins only compared with 20 ± 6%, 16 ± 1% and 16 ± 2% for polyolefins with 9.1 wt% coconut coir pith, sewage sludge and crustaceans, respectively). According to gas analysis, impurities led to a loss of catalyst activity, resulting in a decreased concentration of H2 and increased concentrations of methane and ethylene in the CVD gas. Furthermore, for polyolefins containing 9.1 wt% coconut coir pith, sewage sludge, crustaceans and polylactic acid, microscopy data revealed changes in the growth of filamentous carbon, leading to the appearance of carbon nanofibers in MWCNT samples. On the contrary, biogenic impurities barely changed outer diameters, ID/IG ratios, interlayer spacing, crystallite sizes of graphite-like sites, and the surface chemistry of MWCNT samples.

Abstract: Using the measurement technique pyrolysis gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry, the release characteristics of oxygen-containing compounds and aromatics during the pyrolysis of waste tire (WT) and the co-pyrolysis of WT and bamboo sawdust (BS)/rice hull (RH) were analyzed at low temperature (350 °C), medium temperature (550 °C) and high temperature (750 °C). The oxygen-containing compounds from the WT pyrolysis contained acids, phenols, alcohols, esters, peroxides and oxygen-containing heterocycles. Especially, the acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid presented the highest proportion of 8.68% at 350 °C. The oxygen-containing compounds proportion showed a sharply decreasing trend with the increase of temperature. The aromatics proportion was extremely low at 350 °C and 550 °C, while aromatics proportion was as high as 44.64%, including benzene, alkyl substituted benzene, indene, naphthalene and alkyl substituted naphthalene at 750 °C. The proportion of benzene, toluene and xylene was 17.05%, and that of naphthalene and its derivatives was 7.86%. After adding BS or RH, the aromatics proportion increased at 550 °C. The aromatics proportion decreased by more than 16% with the addition of BS, while the aromatics proportion increased with the addition of RH, such as benzene, indene and naphthalene derivatives. It was also found that the relative oxygen-containing components and aromatics proportion showed an opposite trend along the temperature. At 750 °C, oxygen-containing compounds could be converted into aromatics through a series of free radical reactions. For the WT pyrolysis, N-containing organic compounds proportion in gas product as the temperature increased. While the S-containing organic compounds were released into gas phase only at 550 °C. Adding BS could reduce the formation of N- and S- containing organic compounds. However, adding RH inhabited the N-containing organic compounds formation only at 350 °C. Adding RH also inhabited the formation of S-containing organic compounds formation, while this while this positive effect was weaker than that of adding BS. Finally, according to the obtained results from Py-GC/MS at different temperatures, it was found that the active oxygen-containing free radicals released from BS could promote the chain breaking of rubber components and release hydrogen free radicals. With the aggravation of hydrogen transfer reaction, the oxygen-containing organic compounds were continuously transformed into hydrocarbon products.

Abstract: This study proposes a method for recovering value-added monomers from abandoned biodegradable plastics such as used biodegradable straws (UBSs) by utilizing a catalyst made of bottom ash generated from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators. The MSW-derived bottom ash (MSW-BA) catalyst primarily comprises alkaline metal oxides such as CaO (58.88 wt%). Thermogravimetric and single-shot pyrolysis analyses show that polylactic acid (PLA) monomers—lactide and lactic acid—are the main products of UBS pyrolysis. We conducted catalytic pyrolysis of UBS at 500 °C under different atmospheres (N2 and CO2), with and without the MSW-BA catalyst. Compared with non-catalytic pyrolysis, the MSW-BA catalyst-based pyrolysis significantly increased the yield of PLA monomers in both N2 and CO2 environments. This is because the base sites present on the MSW-BA catalyst promoted the polymeric bond cleavage of PLA. The MSW-BA catalyst in CO2 achieved the highest recovery yield of PLA monomers (20.84 wt% per feedstock mass basis), which was approximately 17.75 % higher than that during non-catalytic UBS pyrolysis. The base sites present on the MSW-BA catalyst promoted polymeric bond cleavage of PLA, and the base-catalyzed pyrolysis of PLA was enhanced by the more reactive cleavage of the bond linkages in the presence of CO2.

Abstract: Being the most deployed thermoplastic worldwide, waste polyvinyl chloride (PVC) generation is expected to increase by about 80% over the next couple of decades. Chlorine toxication during the incineration process is a menace for waste handling facilities though various PVC management is in place. Hence, effective chloride capture is considered the primary focus during PVC pyrolysis rather than harnessing the latent hydrocarbons in any form of energy. In order to simulate a real-world situation wherein the chlorine content is proficiently removed from waste PVC using affordable additives, the state-of-the-art online TG-IR-GCMS approach was used to examine the PVC thermal degradation products in the presence and absence of Ca(OH)2. In both cases, the TG analysis revealed twin degradation phases with the simultaneous IR spectral analysis verifying that the HCl release was limited to the first stage with a mass loss of ∼60%; most notably benzene being the other major product with 81.59% relative area as endorsed by GCMS analysis. In the second stage, further PVC chains unzipping generated several other aromatic products upon the Diels–Alder reactions of intramolecular cyclization such as toluene, xylene and other benzene derivatives. The PVC co-pyrolysis with Ca(OH)2 reduced the HCl formation significantly due to the dissociative adsorption of HCl gradually over the calcium surface converting Ca(OH)2 into calcium oxide and eventually into CaCl2 as verified by the XRD crystallinity analysis and surface morphology and elemental mapping via SEM-EDX analysis.",YES,NO,Co-pyrolysis with Ca(OH)2 and focus on HCl dechlorination rather than oil composition or plastic fingerprinting.,CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

The PET component (C1) and full RFTBs component (C3) exhibited two pyrolysis stages (Py1 and Py2) in N2, whereas the glass fiber reinforced polymer (C2) revealed only one pyrolysis stage. Higher heating rates shifted peaks of heat weight loss rate upward due to thermal hysteresis. Under air and CO2 atmospheres, all feedstocks developed an additional gasification stage (Gs, >400 °C), originating from products undergoing partial oxidation reactions in air and interactions in CO2. Both pathways release heat that accelerates pyrolysis through localized thermal enhancement, effectively reducing heat transfer limitations via short-distance energy redistribution.

Abstract: Mixed plastics and papers are two of the main fractions in municipal solid waste which is a critical environmental issue today. Recovering energy and chemicals from this waste stream by pyrolysis is one of the favorable options to achieve a circular economy. While pyrolysis products from plastics are mainly hydrocarbons, pyrolysis products from paper/biomass are highly oxygenated. The different nature of the two pyrolysis products results in different treatments and applications as well as economic values. Therefore, separation of these two products by multi-step pyrolysis based on their different decomposition temperatures could be beneficial for downstream processes to recover materials, chemicals and/or energy. In this work, stepwise pyrolysis of mixed plastics and paper waste was performed in a batch type fixed bed reactor using two different pyrolysis temperatures. Neat plastic materials (polystyrene, polyethylene) and cellulose mixtures were used as starting materials. Then, the same conditions were applied to a mixed plastics and paper residue stream derived from paper recycling process. The condensable products were analyzed by GC/MS. It was found that pyrolysis temperatures during the first and second step of 350 and 500 °C resulted in a better separation of the oxygenated and hydrocarbon condensates than when a lower pyrolysis temperature (300 °C) was used in the first step. The products from the first step were derived from cellulose with some heavy fraction of styrene oligomers, while the products from the second step were mainly hydrocarbons derived from polystyrene and polyethylene. This thus shows that stepwise pyrolysis can separate the products from these materials, although with some degree of overlapping products. Indications of interaction between PS and cellulose during stepwise pyrolysis were observed including an increase in char yield, a decrease in liquid yield from the first temperature step and changes in liquid composition, compared to stepwise pyrolysis of the two materials separately. A longer vapor residence time in the second step was found to help reducing the amount of wax derived from polyethylene.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of pinewood and different kinds of plastic wastes in different mass fractions using polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), and polycarbonate (BPC) were investigated.

Differential thermography (DTG) results showed enhanced decomposition peaks of biomass along with longer evolution of syngas and decreased peak of plastic polymers using BPC or PETE.

This suggests increased carbon conversion efficiency and volatiles yield during co-pyrolysis compared to individual component pyrolysis. First order distributed activation energy modeling (DAEM) with 5 pseudo-components revealed that the synergistic effects of biomass with PP or PETE were mainly due to physical nature of the polymers as observed from increased activation energy bandwidth of biomass decomposition.

Abstract: We conducted ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of corn stalk (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over HZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the production of hydrocarbons. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and CS-to-HDPE mass ratio (CS/HDPE) on the yield of condensable volatile organic products (CVOPs) and the relative content of hydrocarbons were studied. The synergisms between CS and HDPE were determined based on the difference between the experimental and theoretical CVOP and hydrocarbons content. The results showed that the addition of HDPE significantly promotes the production of CVOPs, reaching the maximum value at 750 °C.

Abstract: In recent time, poor solid waste management has led to blockage of several drainages in major cosmopolitan cities. The health hazard associated with this waste is devastating especially during raining season in tropical region prone to flooding. Due to their non-biodegradable nature, low density polyethylene (LDPE) materials constitute nuisance to the environment as a result of inappropriate disposal method. This research work is geared towards ameliorating this societal menace by the generation of hydrocarbons from LDPE wastes (LDPEW) through the process pyrolysis. The LDPEW obtained from dumpsites were subjected to high temperature pyrolysis under a controlled system to generate hydrocarbons with potentials as petrochemical additives. The obtained hydrocarbons are fractionated after purification and characterisation using GC–MS. The GC–MS analysis showed that the major components of the hydrocarbons expressed in area % were; xylene (9.20) toluene (8.39), 1-butanone (7.49) cyclooctane (6.89) undecane (8.52) dodecane (6.40) 1-tridecene (5.39) decane (4.54) 1-tetradecene (3.72) benzene (2.62). The obtained physicochemical parameters of the hydrocarbons as petrochemicals are in the ranges: 0.3436–3.2719 mPas (absolute viscosity), 0.7269–3.9900 Mm2/s (kinematic viscosity), 0.7269–0.8200 g/cm3 (density) and 0.7401–08305 kg/m3 (specific gravity at 15/15 °C). It was observed that 20 % v/v blend of petrochemical additives enhance the properties of major petroleum products (PMS, Kerosene, Diesel).

Abstract: The present study employs microwave (MW) energy to enhance the co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes and biomass. Based on the characterization of raw materials as well as gas and liquid products, we propose a pyrolysis mechanism of PET and biomass during microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). The MAP of PET-biomass blends shows a synergetic effect that the interaction between PET and biomass promotes the yields of value-added products (e.g. aromatic acids and phenols) and suppresses the generation of biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to the MAP of individual biomass or plastics. Besides, the blending ratio of PET-biomass has significant effect on the formation of major liquid products. The liquid product from the MAP of PET-biomass 4:1 blends contains above 30 wt.% chain hydrocarbon that can be used as gasoline and kerosene. Moreover, we evaluate the roles of three typical MW absorbing materials during MAP, including carbon powder, ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) and calcium oxide (CaO). Carbon powder can enlarge the yield of main products from plastics pyrolysis due to its significant dielectric loss. Apart from the MW-absorbing ability, Fe3O4 can accelerate the esterification and decarboxylation reaction; CaO can convert acids into ketones and hydrocarbons through neutralization and catalytic cracking reactions.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass, no pure plastic-only condition with oil composition data",CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: Caprolactam is the main compound of nylon 6 waste fishing nets (WFNs) and its recovery conserves natural resources, maximizes WFNs economic performance, and closes the circular economy loop of the fishing net industry. Within the framework and as a part of the Healthy Seas’ initiative to clean the oceans from waste fishing nets (WFNs), and to valorise it, this research aims to study the catalytic pyrolysis behaviour of the WFNs extracted from oceans in order to study their potential applications in the energy conversion field. The catalytic pyrolysis experiments of WFNs over ZSM-5 Zeolite catalyst (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 wt%) were conducted using thermogravimetry (TG) coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at different heating rates (5–30 °C/min). Also, the kinetics of ZSM-5/WFNs catalytic pyrolysis was studied by model-free methods (KAS, FWO, and Friedman). In addition, the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) and the independent parallel reaction kinetic model (IPR) combined with the optimization algorithm were used to fit the TGA-DTG experimental data and to calculate the parameters that can achieve the minimum deviation. The TGA results showed that the main decomposition zone was located in the range 342–476 °C with a total weight loss 83-75 wt% (based on the amount of catalyst). Meanwhile, FTIR and GC-MS results manifested that alkyl C–H stretch functional group, carbonyl functional group (CO), and caprolactam (83.15%; at 20 wt% of ZSM-5) are the main groups and volatile compounds in the decomposed WFNs samples. The model-free kinetics analysis showed that all activation energies were estimated at 112 kJ/mol (WFNs) and 158, 230, 197, 201, and 220 kJ/mol for ZSM-5/WFNs samples (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 wt%). At the same time, DAEM and IPR models proved a high prediction to fit TG curves at all heating rates.

Abstract: In this study, waste polyethylene (PP) obtained from obsoleting water purifier filter was mixed with ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) to prepare a series of single crystal phased iron compound incorporated carbon composites (Fe/PP-C). The prepared Fe/PP-Cx catalysts were then utilized to degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in water by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The results showed that with the assistance of pyrolysis temperature regulation, waste PP filter could control the crystalline phase of the iron compound in the prepared Fe/PP-Cx through releasing distinct gaseous atmospheres at respective pyrolysis temperature. When the pyrolysis temperature was set at 600 °C and 900 °C, pure phase ferric oxide (Fe3O4) and zero-valent iron (ZVI) incorporated carbon catalysts were obtained, respectively. 0.2 g/L of Fe/PP-Cx could completely degrade 0.02 mM of SMX within 20 min, in which the toxicity of the reaction solution was also effectively reduced. In both Fe/PP-Cx/PMS systems, non-radical mechanisms dominated the SMX degradation, in which singlet oxygen played the dominant role in the Fe/PP-C600/PMS system, whereas electron transfer process was primarily responsible for SMX degradation in the Fe/PP-C900/PMS system. High-valent iron-oxo species was also involved in SMX degradation in the Fe/PP-C900/PMS system. Since Fe/PP-C600 and Fe/PP-C900 respectively activated PMS via heterogeneous and homogeneous routes, Fe/PP-C600 maintained higher longtime use stability.

In the experiments, active carbon used as a tar removal additive sharply increased the yields of syngas, char, H2, and CO and decreased the condensed tar yield. Although toluene, styrene, naphthalene, biphenyl, and anthracene were found in the syngas obtained without active carbon, none were found in the experiment with active carbon. The tar content in the gas with active carbon was 13 mg/Nm3. A high tar-cracking reactor temperature and a high steam/fuel ratio favored the production of syngas and H2.

Abstract: The feasibility of an alternative process for the processing of plastic/aluminum combinations by means of pyrolysis has been studied. Below the melting temperature of aluminum, the main fraction of the plastics can be devolatilized. As the plastic fraction often mainly consists of PVC, it is more economical to incinerate the pyrolysis products on-site, in combination with HCl removal and heat recovery. In the case of a high concentration of other plastics, e.g. ABS and PET, it is possible to get a valuable pyrolysis oil. Degradation of PVC mainly occurs through elimination of side groups, i.e. chlorine. 90% or more of this chlorine can be released as HCl. During pyrolysis of PVC, hardly any formation of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofuranes occurs.

Abstract: The production of hydrocarbon-rich liquid fuels from mixed waste plastics through the catalytic pyrolysis process is reported including engine performance. Four different catalysts, viz., DOL, SiDOL, ZSM-5, and ZSMDOL, were prepared and characterized using XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM, and EDX. The catalytic activity was assessed in pyrolysis process to produce pyro-oils. The fuel properties were determined using various ASTM methods. The analysis showed that catalysts can change fuel properties such as viscosity, density, cloud & pour points, flash & fire points, calorific values, etc. The GC–MS results suggested a higher fraction (66–85%) of lower hydrocarbons (<C12) are formed during catalytic cracking as compared to thermal cracking (∼51%). FTIR and NMR analysis confirmed the presence of different hydrocarbons (paraffin, olefin, and aromatics) in pyro-oils. A higher percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons was seen with ZSM-5 catalyst due to diffusion of primary pyrolysis products into catalyst pores resulting in formation of aromatics via a common hydrocarbon pool and higher H/C value in the feedstock.

This paper demonstrates the microwave-assisted decomposition of plastic waste materials for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and high H2 production using magnetic-based catalysts via in-situ exsolution. Magnetic-based catalysts, namely Al2O3-NiFe2O4, Al2O3-ZnFe2O4, and Al2O3-MgFe2O4 were prepared using aluminum oxide, iron nitrate, zinc nitrate, and magnesium nitrate. CNTs and H2 were produced from the decomposition of wasted HDPE using the prepared catalysts. The Al2O3-NiFe2O4 catalyst showed better formation of CNTs and gas due to its low dielectric loss factor. The high surface area and magnetic-support interaction also promoted the catalytic activity of the catalyst.

Abstract: The pyrolysis-catalysis of a simulated mixture of plastics representing the plastic mixture found in municipal solid waste has been carried out to determine the influence of process conditions on the production of upgraded fuel oils and chemicals and gases. The catalysts used were spent zeolite from a fluid catalytic cracker (FCC), Y-zeolite and ZSM-5 zeolite. The addition of a catalyst to the process produced a marked increase in gas yield, with more gas (mainly C1–C4 hydrocarbons) being produced as the temperature of the catalyst was raised from 500 °C to 600 °C. The Si/Al ratio of the catalysts influenced the composition of other gases with the more basic catalysts producing more CO and the strongly acidic catalyst producing more H2. The yield of product oil decreased with the addition of the catalysts, but the oil was of significantly lower molecular weight range, containing a product slate of premium fuel range C5–C15 hydrocarbons. In addition, the content of aromatic compounds in the product oil was increased; for example, benzene and toluene accounted for more than 90% of the aromatic content of the oil from the strongly acidic Y-zeolite catalysts.

Abstract: Annually accumulating decommissioned Photovoltaic modules pose severe environmental risks. Pyrolysis is key for resource recovery via disassembly, but conventional 500 °C pyrolysis produces hazardous fluorinated pollution. This study analyzed pyrolysis mechanisms for EVA encapsulant and fluorinated KPK backsheets (PVDF/PET/PVDF) using thermal, IR, and MS techniques. Key findings: (1) EVA pyrolyzes in two stages: dominant deacetylation (300–400 °C), then chain scission (400–500 °C); (2) PVDF decomposition (300–600 °C) releases most fluorine as gaseous pollutants (e.g., 1,2,4-trifluorobenzene, SiF₄), leaving fluoride-containing solid residues; (3) The major KPK weight loss peak (350–500 °C) stems primarily from PET. Exploiting these thermal properties, a novel two-stage, fluorine-controlled process is proposed: First, heat to 350 °C to trigger intense EVA deacetylation and adhesion loss before significant PVDF cracking, allowing non-polluting backsheet removal. Then, raise temperature to 500 °C to fully pyrolyze residual EVA.

Abstract: Background The synergic effect of textural and acidity properties of zeolite composite catalysts needs to be investigated, to improve catalyst design for plastic pyrolysis. The proximity of the acid sites of the catalysts can increase accessibility and reduce the diffusion limitation of macromolecules, improving the performance of zeolite catalysts. Methods In this study, polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis was studied over different zeolites (ZSM-5, HY, and MCM-41) and their diverse composites in a dual-bed fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. The parent catalysts were synthesized by hydrothermal method and two techniques (granular mixing and powder mixing) were applied to prepare the composite catalysts. The structure and acidity of the catalysts were characterized by FE-SEM, XRD, BET-BJH, NH3-TPD, FT-IR, and TGA techniques. Significant Findings The catalysts included a uniform morphology, high crystallinity, high surface area (>360 m2g−1), and mesopore structure. The MCM-41/HY composite catalyst had superior catalytic performance in both forms of granular mixing and powder mixing. The highest amount of gasoline hydrocarbons (76.6 %) was achieved by the powder mixing, including olefin (28.3 %), paraffin (1.7 %), isoparaffin (8 %), aromatic (5.6 %), and cyclo compounds (32.4 %). The developed catalyst showed high stability, reusability, and low coke tendency. Furthermore, high activity was achieved in the pyrolysis of real PP waste plastic.

Abstract: Chemical recycling processes, such as pyrolysis, have the potential to break down the polymer (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA) into its main building blocks (monomers), and thus enable the preservation of full functionality in closed-loop recycling processes. In this study, products from flash pyrolysis of PMMA are quantitatively determined using an ex situ exhaust gas analysis by means of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To achieve this, the FTIR is additionally calibrated for methyl methacrylate (MMA) with an MMA/N2 mixture of various concentrations. Flash pyrolysis conditions (heating rates approximately 10 3 K s − 1 ) are realized with a small-scale fluidized bed reactor operated with a nitrogen atmosphere and temperatures between 573 and 873 K with a continuous feed of PMMA granules. The experiments reveal MMA yields up to 90 % at 673 K. With increasing temperature, the MMA yield drops to approximately 50 % at 873 K. In return, the yields of the MMA decomposition products such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), propylene (C3H6), and formaldehyde (CH2O) increase. The approximated residence time of 20–30 s leads to a stronger decomposition of the MMA into its fragments (especially at higher temperatures) than in other studies, which can be well modeled with a single first-order decomposition mechanism.

Abstract: The kinetics of the catalytic cracking of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) over three FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) equilibrium commercial catalysts has been modeled. The PPO comes from the fast pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The cracking runs have been carried out in a laboratory-scale reactor under FCC conditions: 500–560 °C; catalyst/oil weight ratio of 5 gcat gPPO -1; and contact time of 1.5–6 s. Four different reaction schemes composed of six lumps have been compared and it has been obtained by statistical means that the simplest one is the most appropriate for describing the process. The differences in the kinetic parameters have been related to the properties of the catalysts. Among them, total acidity and mesoporous structure have a key role. The former for promoting the cracking reactions and the latter for limiting the diffusional restrictions of both the bulky compounds within the PPO and the formed coke precursors. This way, ECAT-3 that is the most acid and most mesoporous catalyst, maximizes the yields of naphtha (33.6 wt%) and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) (18.9 wt%). In contrast, ECAT-1 and ECAT-2 should be chosen for producing light cycle oil (LCO).

Abstract: The catalytic pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene (Br-HIPS) was performed in the presence of five different solid acid catalysts in order to remove the bromine from the derived pyrolysis oil. The catalysts were three zeolite materials (HY, Hβ and HZSM-5) and two mesoporous solids (all-silica MCM-41 and active Al2O3). The results showed that in the presence of HY and Hβ zeolites, a reduction of approximate 50wt.% in oil yield and a corresponding increase in wax and gas yields were obtained compared to thermal degradation. The addition of HZSM-5 showed less impact on product distribution and produced more oil compared with the other zeolites. The mesoporous catalyst of all-silica MCM-41 obtained the highest oil yield of 67.9wt.% and reduced the wax yield to 8.73wt.%.

Abstract: The thermal decomposition of polyalkenes was investigated as a recycling route for the production of petrochemical feedstock. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were thermally decomposed individually in a batch reactor at 450°C, thus forming oil/wax products. Then these products were dissolved in primary heavy naphtha to obtain steam cracking feedstock. The selectivity and kinetics of copyrolysis for 10mass% solutions of oil/waxes from LDPE or PP with naphtha in the temperature range from 740 to 820°C at residence times from 0.09 to 0.54s were studied. The decomposition of polyalkene oil/waxes during copyrolysis was confirmed. It was shown that the yields of the desired alkenes (ethene, propene), according to polymer type, increased or only slightly decreased compared to the yields from naphtha. In addition to the primary reactions, the secondary reactions leading to coke formation have also been studied. The formation of coke during copyrolysis of LDPE wax with naphtha was comparable to the coking of pure naphtha. Slightly higher formation of coke was obtained at PP wax solution at the beginning of the measurements, on the clean surface of the reactor. After a thin layer of coke covered the walls, the production was the same as that from naphtha.

Abstract: In the present paper, automotive waste plastics were considered as a potential source of fuels and chemicals. The feedstock in the experimental tests was represented by the heaviest fractions from the distillation of pyro-oil from the pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE-wax) and polypropylene (PP-wax). Due to their very high viscosity both polymer-waxes were, prior to processing, diluted in atmospheric gas oil (GO). Mixtures with hydrotreated vacuum gas oil (HVGO) were also prepared and processed under simulated fluid catalytic cracking conditions via a MAT-test. The product distribution was similar to the one shown by the commercial FCC process: light gases (C1, C2), LPG, gasoline fraction, light and heavy cycle oil. To maintain optimal performance a commercial FCC equilibrium catalyst (FCC-ECAT) was used. When processing HDPE and PP waxes, high yields of profiling products – propylene and gasoline were obtained. In the case of the PP-wax feed without HVGO, the yield of gasoline was even higher than in case of pure HVGO. When cracking HDPE-wax feed mixtures the product distribution was oriented more towards the production of propylene. The composition of liquid products considering all types of feedstock consisted mainly of iso-alkanes and aromatics.

Abstract: The co-pyrolytic behaviour of single-use plastics (Polystyrene, Low-density polyethylene) and Eucalyptus biomass was investigated at variable temperatures (300, 400, 500, and 600 °C) and the effects of their interactions on the characteristics of solid chars were also studied. The variation in thermal profiles of ‘Δ Mass loss%’ showed the inhibitory and synergistic effects of plastics on the biomass degradation, resulting in higher and lower yields of char composite, respectively.

Abstract: A six-lump kinetic model has been developed for the hydroprocessing of a mixture of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) in a ratio of 90:10 wt%, using a NiW/HY catalyst. This process aims to valorize waste plastics by producing valuable oil fractions such as naphtha and light cycle oil (LCO). The experiments were conducted in a semi-continuous stirred tank reactor across a temperature range of 370–440 °C and under 80 bar hydrogen pressure. Special attention was given on developing models to quantify the deactivation effects caused by coke and metal (Fe) deposition, with the latter having a lesser impact. These models are based on experimentally validated mechanisms of these phenomena, investigated through different post-mortem characterization techniques applied to spent catalysts. The successful fit of a separable deactivation model –featuring different deactivation functions for each reaction lump and an activity function related to the coke content– highlights the significant impact of pore blocking due to coke deposition. This blocking selectively affects the diffusion of molecules within the different lumps, depending on their volume. The results indicate that increasing the temperature has a favorable effect on the yield of naphtha and LCO fractions. At 440 °C and 180 min, the yield of these lumps exceeds 70 wt%, with a conversion greater than 75 %.

To validate the mechanism, iron-based catalysts with different microwave-absorbing properties were prepared using different catalyst supports including activated carbon, silicon carbide, and silicon dioxide. The experimental results showed that the catalysts with high dielectric loss promoted the gas yield and the growth of CNTs.

Abstract: This study investigates the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes of waste wind turbine blades (WWTB) and polyolefins (POs) at 450 °C in a round bottom tank reactor. The study contains three experimental sets: 1) batch pyrolysis of POs; 2) continuous pyrolysis of WWTB; 3) continuous feeding of WWTB into a molten PO medium, which was previously fed to the round bottom tank reactor batch-wise. Individual WWTB pyrolysis yields a modest 18.7 wt% of liquid, predominantly influenced by elevated ash and fixed carbon content. Conversely, co-pyrolysis demonstrates positive synergies, with escalating polyolefin content boosting liquid yields, reaching a peak at 61.5 wt% with a WWTB:POs mixture (25:75, wt%), while concurrently suppressing gas production to 21.6 wt%. The primary chemical groups found in the liquid obtained from WWTB are phenol and phenolic compounds, with their abundance diminishing as the POs ratio in feedstocks increases. Analysis of non-condensable gases from WWTB reveals that approximately 57.7 wt% are oxygen-containing, predominantly CO and CO2. Co-pyrolysis with POs at a 25:75 (wt%) ratio yields 47.1 wt% C3H6, resembling POs pyrolysis. The resulting solid products are rich in carbon and contains high ash. This research not only offers a detailed product analysis of WWTB but also sheds light on the dynamics of its co-pyrolysis with POs.

Abstract: Large amounts of styrene and other important aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained employing microwave assisted pyrolysis for the depolymerization of polystyrene in the presence of carbon as an absorber. Working at a reduced pressure the yield of liquid was increased (higher than 75%) with respect to those obtained at ambient pressure. This liquid was clear and showed a low viscosity and density. On the contrary a dark brown liquid was formed when pyrolysis was carried out in a stream of nitrogen, but the yield was 94.3wt%. Using a fractionating system and a residual pressure of 21.3kPa the maximum concentration of styrene in the liquid was reached (71.9wt%) corresponding to the maximum amount of styrene recovered from the starting PS (60.6wt%). The substitution of carbon with silicon carbide as MW absorber, gave almost the same amount of liquid but the rate of pyrolysis was strongly reduced. Composition of liquids was affected by residence time into the reactor and some different compounds might be obtained by reaction among intermediates formed in the course of the process.

Abstract: Converting waste plastic into marketable hydrocarbons is a promising way to protect the environment and earn financial gain. While several kinetic studies have examined the cracking of waste plastic, they are often oversimplified or inappropriate for designing an industrial reactor. This work proves the necessity of using isoconversional methods by using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC verified that cracking of waste plastic involves the production of several intermediates, indicating that the kinetics is more complex and requires further studies.

Abstract: In this article, the pyrolysis and thermo-degradation of 11 virgin-polypropylene (virgin-PP) with different levels of arsenic in its polymer matrix, was carried out in a discontinuous quartz reactor at 500 °C. To quantify arsine (AsH3), 4 points were sampled during the PP synthesis process and a methodology was applied by GC with 4 detectors, which simultaneously and with a single injection allowed to quantify multiple components. AsH3 in propylene varied between 0.05 and 4.73 ppm and arsenic in virgin-PP residues between 0.001 and 4.32 ppm for PP0 and PP10. These generated an increase in the melt flow index from 3.0 to 24.51 and maintained a direct relationship with an R2 of 0.9993. The origin of thermo-oxidative degradation and the beginnings of virgin-PP pyrolysis are explained by the formation to aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, carboxylic acid functional groups, CO and CO2. These species caused TG and DTG curves to have atypical behavior for PP. For example, PP10 with an arsenic content of 4.32 ppm presented 3 degradation peaks at 80, 90 and 200 °C with a mass loss ratio of 22%, 18% and 55% °C−1 respectively.

Abstract: Enhancing the target product yields from co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass relies on the synergetic interaction of their intermediate products. Therefore, a key factor in strengthening this synergy is increasing the yield of both feedstocks’ intermediate products. The study innovatively utilizes the “Burger” layered filling strategy to alter the mass transfer process and affect the yield of key intermediate products. In the traditional homogenous blending mode, the plastic will first melt and encapsulate biomass during the heating process to block the mass transfer process, thus limiting their interaction. However, the “Burger” layered method mitigates mass transfer constraints and has a positive impact on increasing the relative content of key intermediates and aromatic hydrocarbons. For instance, compared to the homogeneous blending pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and lignin, the layered pyrolysis increased the relative content of phenolic compounds, which are key intermediates during lignin pyrolysis, from 9.02 % to 13.49 %.

Abstract: The pyrolysis of used rubber is a promising approach for resource recovery; however, the selective recovery of isoprene remains a challenge due to extensive thermal decomposition and secondary reactions. This study proposes a co-pyrolysis process aimed at enhancing the retention of the isoprene skeleton in the recovered liquid rubber during low-temperature pyrolysis. A cross-linked polyisoprene rubber reinforced with carbon black was co-pyrolyzed with phenolic antioxidants, namely tetrakis[methylene(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]methane, denoted as AO-1010, and n-octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, denoted as AO-1076, to inhibit radical-induced structural degradation. The isoprene skeleton retention rate decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature for all samples. However, antioxidant-treated rubbers (AO-1010 and AO-1076) showed higher retention at 300 °C compared to untreated rubber, indicating that antioxidants can suppress thermal degradation and preserve the isoprene structure at elevated temperatures. For untreated rubber, the isoprene recovery rate increased from approximately 12 % at 200 °C to a peak of 53 % at 270 °C, followed by a sharp decline to 34 % at 300 °C, suggesting intensified secondary reactions at higher temperatures.

Abstract: Catalytic cracking of a plastic mixture consisting of LDPE and ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer (86/14 w/w) over mesoporous Al-SBA-15 and Al-MCM-41 materials as well as nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite (crystal size ∼35 nm) has been carried out in a batch reactor at 400–420°C. The release of acetic acid formed from the EVA decomposition was observed within the temperature range 350–400°C. The most active catalyst was nanometer size HZSM-5 that led to complete conversion of the plastic mixture at 420°C whereas both Al-MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15 were meaningfully less active. In addition, the polymer mixture was more difficult to be cracked both thermally and catalytically than pure LDPE. This result has been ascribed to the occurrence of cross-linking reactions leading to a fast deactivation by coke fouling especially over mesoporous catalysts (Al-MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15) because of their open structure. A high selectivity towards C1–C5 hydrocarbons (∼75%) was attained over nanometer size HZSM-5, most of them being valuable C3–C4 olefins.

Abstract: This work uses cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles and purified plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) to create and evaluate nano fuel for four-stroke diesel engines. The objective is to increase engine performance and decrease emissions without altering the engine. PPO is mixed with conventional diesel fuel to form modified diesel fuel, which is then mixed with surfactant-modified CeO2 nanoparticles to produce a special nano fuel. HR-TEM, SEM, EDS, and XRD characterise the characteristics of the modified nanoparticles. A four-stroke diesel engine is used to test the nano fuel in order to assess emission characteristics and engine efficiency. Comparing the recommended procedure to commercial diesel fuel, the findings demonstrate a 16% reduction in pollutants and a 10% improvement in engine efficiency. This is because the oxygen in the nanoparticles makes the fuel purer and more viscous, which enhances burning efficiency. The performance and emission properties of the nano fuel are evaluated using a four-stroke diesel engine. The results show that, when compared to commercial diesel fuel, the suggested approach increases engine efficiency by 10% and decreases emissions by 16%.

Abstract: The commonly used pyrolytic catalysts (molecular sieves, metals, etc.) are expensive and easily inactivated, which is a major difficulty in the catalytic pyrolysis technology. In this work, the effect of low-cost kaolin with different particle sizes on the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in fixed furnace and its reusability are studied. The results show that the liquid oil mainly contains aliphatics and aromatics. The carbon number of liquid oils is mainly in the range of C6-C20, accounting for 90%-95%. The first addition of 1250 mesh kaolin (K1250) produces the highest contents of aliphatics (64.66%) and hydrocarbons (93.91%) and H2 (30.07%). During the repeated use of K1250, the increasing trend of aromatics content was consistent with the results of particle size increase. The presence of carbon deposition after the use of the catalyst causes slight coking, which increases the acidity and particle size of the catalyst. K1250 is suitable for the production of liquid oil with better quality (more hydrocarbons, more aliphatic groups) and higher yield in the early stage of use.

Abstract: The thermal cracking of a polyolefin (HDPE) has been investigated in the presence of solvents with different hydrogen-donating capabilities (9,10-dihydroanthracene, tetralin, decalin and 1-methylnaphthalene) with the aim of increasing the yields of C5–C32 α-olefins, which are valuable hydrocarbons for the chemical industry. The results have been also compared with the corresponding solventless reaction. The HDPE thermal degradation in the presence of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and tetralin, which are good hydrogen-donating solvents, led to the lowest yields of C5–C32 hydrocarbons. On the contrary, the reactions with the poor hydrogen-donating solvents, 1-methylnaphthalene and decalin, gave the highest C5–C32 yields, the main components of this fraction being α-olefins. However, the use of decalin is better recommended, because 1-methylnaphthalene loses its methyl group during the HDPE thermal degradation. These results have been explained based on the HDPE degradation mechanism. One of the main changes introduced by these solvents is the suppression of the reactions between intermediate radicals and α-olefins, effect which is responsible for the enhancement in the α-olefins content of the final products.

In this study, bio-oils obtained from fast co-pyrolysis in a microscale fixed-bed reactor were chemically analyzed using gas chromatography (GC/MS) for compound identification. Green coconut fibers were collected, deposited on the soil, exposed to environmental factors for 30 days, and subjected to pyrolysis. The samples were characterized by proximate and elemental analysis, high heating value (HHV) and thermal gravimetrical analysis (TGA). Mixtures of this biomass with polymers (PP, HDPE, and LDPE), were pyrolyzed and the bio-oils were chromatographically analyzed. The analysis of resulting bio-oils revealed that the mixture containing 25 % of each of the three polymers and 25 % of biomass was the most effective, reducing phenols and furans, and eliminating ketones.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass, no pure plastic-only condition and no focus on plastic-specific oil fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS

Abstract: This study evaluates the effect of typical polymer fillers on the thermal degradation of a commodity plastic to produce liquid fuels. HDPE was degraded in the presence and absence of some metallic additives such as Al(OH)3·xH2O, AlCl3, Al2O3, CaCO3, CuO, ZrO2, and Fe2O3. Liquefaction of HDPE in the presence of selected additives was also carried out to verify the thermal gravimetric data. The HDPE liquefaction conditions such as temperature, effect of H2 or N2 pressure, and time were established before studying the effect of additives. At 50% weightloss, Al2O3 increased the degradation temperature by ~30 °C, whereas ZrO2 and CaCO3 decreased it by ~30 and 70 °C, respectively. All the additives were thermally stable below 600 °C except AlCl3 and Al(OH)3·xH2O. Under the experimental conditions used, the thermal degradation trend of HDPE in the presence of Al2O3 was clearly reflected in the liquefaction product analysis. With Al2O3, the liquefaction of HDPE was delayed, which in turn resulted in wax formation. It was further proved by simulated distillation and gel permeation chromatographic analysis. More gas in the presence of ZrO2 and more oil (85%) in the case of CaCO3 were produced when compared to the liquefaction of HDPE alone (75%). However, the simulated distillation and GPC analysis of these products obtained at the end of 30 min liquefaction time did not show significant variation when compared to that of HDPE alone. The nature of gas did not affect the oil yield. However, the temperature and time were critical in obtaining the maximum oil yield.",YES,YES,"HDPE thermal liquefaction with CaCO3 catalyst producing 85% oil yield and detailed product analysis including simulated distillation and GPC, indicating oil composition data.",HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;GENERAL_CATALYST

The zeolites were synthesized by conventional techniques and characterized by XRD, pyridine FTIR and N2 adsorption.

Thermal analyses confirmed that the temperature of decomposition of the polymer can be decreased in as much as about 145°C when the catalysts were added. As compared to the thermal degradation, the catalytic conversion produced less solid residues and much higher amounts of gas and liquid hydrocarbons. The catalysts showed different yield profiles: the H-ZSM-11 zeolite yielded more gases, while the Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite yielded more liquid products.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene(PE) wastes with different blending ratios were performed in a bench-scale fixed bed over Ni/char catalyst. The synergistic mechanism between coke depositions and gas products during co-pyrolysis was studied for better regulation of H2 production. The results showed that feedstock blending ratio played a decisive role in competitive growth of amorphous coke and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the catalyst surface. For low PE ratio (≤50 wt%) a negative synergy on H2 yield was generated. It was ascribed to more oxygenates that were more inclined than hydrocarbons to be absorbed by porous char to form amorphous coke, which encapsulated Ni active sites and internal pore channel of catalyst, thus resulting in deactivation of catalyst. For higher PE content, Ni/char catalyst produced more than triple the amounts of H2 yield (42.28 mmol/gfeedstock) as compared to low PE ratio (11.3 mmol/gfeedstock). A maximum positive synergy on syngas quality was yielded at 75% PE. Despite the high yield (37.8 wt%) of deposited coke, more hydrocarbon gas from plastic pyrolysis condensed on catalyst and promoted CNTs growth via dehydrogenation and polymerization, simultaneously generating H2. The unique hollow tubular structure and tip-growth mode of CNTs exposed more Ni active sites and endowed catalyst with lower deactivation extent. The scission of more chain hydrocarbons was subsequently enhanced to interact with oxygenated compounds. Therefore, appropriate PE ratios (>50%) can exert a positive synergy on gaseous conversion by regulating coke nature during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. Furthermore, coke structure rather than content seems to exert more significant effect.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis with biomass and focus on hydrogen and CNT production, with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_HYDROGEN;TARGET_CNT;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The study focused on producing hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as an adsorbent which provides high efficiency in desulfurization processes.

Liquid fuel was produced in a fluidized bed reactor at 550 °C under a nitrogen gas flow. Post-desulfurization, the fuel's density, water content, and calorific value increased, while sulfur content and flash point decreased, with sulfur content showing a significant reduction of 79.23 %. The desulfurized fuel (PS-A) exhibited better combustion characteristics and closely resembled diesel fuel performance, though it slightly reduced engine effective efficiency by 1.06 % compared to diesel. Both PS-A and pre-desulfurized fuel (PS-B) significantly reduced soot emissions by 23.28 % and 20.81 %, respectively, compared to diesel.

Abstract: Experimentally, empirical rate constants are used to extract liquid fuels and gases from the thermal decomposition of high-density plastics (HDPs). However, this approach is costly, time-consuming, and not commercially viable for producing a sustainable volume of liquid fuel. The prediction of rate constants is, therefore, imperative to boost the efficiency of the scaled destruction of plastic waste into fuels and other valuable products. We used the Box-Behnken technique in response surface methodology (RSM) to forecast temperature-dependent rate constants for thermal destruction of HDP. Most appropriate combinations of activation energies (Ea), exponential factors (Ao) and rate constants (k) were predicted statistically for better insight into HDP reaction mechanism for commercial scale production of oils and gases. The predicted parameters were used in a 2nd order ordinary differential solver to simulate the amount of oil and gases. The thermal treatment of HDP under optimized conditions resulted in 99 % oil production after 240 min of reaction.

Abstract: In recent years, the world has witnessed a rapid rise in waste production and energy demand, which has increased interests in waste to energy processes, particularly the co-pyrolysis of wood and plastic waste. Nonetheless, for plastic waste, most research studies narrowly focus on polyolefins because of their abundance in waste streams and their high oil yields from pyrolysis. In this paper, we study the co-pyrolysis of non-polyolefins – polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) – and poplar wood (PW), in order to investigate the synergistic effect of PS and PVC content on product yield, gas specie yield and heating value. The experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor, heated to 750 ° C at a rate of 20 ° C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. Our results show that PVC has a large positive synergy on char yield with a maximum value of 8 wt% at 30 wt% PVC content, whereas PS only showed a slightly positive synergy (2.5 wt% maximum). Concerning oil and gas production, PS provides a small synergy. However, PVC showed a significant positive synergy on oil yield with a maximum value of 11 wt% at 50 wt% PVC content, which was linked to a strong negative synergy in gas production. Regarding gas specie yields, the addition of PS led to positive synergies in the formation of H2, CH4, CO and CO2, although insignificant interactions were observed for C x H y compounds. Furthermore, by comparing the distribution of chloride species in the products of co-pyrolysis with PVC, using experimental and theoretical methods, we discovered that the negative synergy in HCl yield observed was mainly due to the dissolution of HCl in the water fraction of the condensed oil phase, rather than the formation of chlorinated organic compounds, as suggested in previous literature works.

Abstract: Plastic Waste has become an increased problem in many industrialised countries. Concern over the volumes being created has lead to a number of governments introducing new legislation for its recovery as a resource. Traditional recovery methods have generally concentrated on recycling of materials or incineration for energy. The majority of polymers in waste are mainly hydrocarbon in nature and so can be used as a feedstock for the chemical industries or as a fuel. Pyrolysis is a tertiary recycling process and has an ability to provide three end products: a gas, an oil and a char which all have the potential to be further utilised. It is anticipated that if waste recovery targets currently being set are to be met then methods, such as pyrolysis, will have to be closely examined. The pyrolysis of a plastic mixture in a fluidised bed reactor was studied. The mixture was a simulated fraction of that found in municipal solid waste in Europe. The reactor was constructed of stainless steel and was 70 cm high × 10 cm diameter, with a 17 cm high × 20 cm diameter expander section. The sample was introduced batchwise into the bed. The influence of temperature on product yield and composition was studied. Pyrolysis was carried out at temperatures between 500 and 700°C. This gave widely differing product yields of between 9.79 and 88.76% gas and between 18.44 and 57.11% oil. The oils were analysed for their functional groups using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The molecular weight distribution was also determined using size exclusion chromatography.

Abstract: With the transition of the chemical industry towards renewable and recycled feedstocks, cracking catalysts are explored for a new application in converting difficult to recycle polyolefin plastics to feeds for the chemical industry. The refining industry generates large volumes of equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking catalysts (ECAT) as waste materials, which might find a secondary end-of-life application as plastic cracking catalyst. Herein, we aim at establishing which ECAT materials are particularly attractive for plastic waste conversion. We screened a broad range of materials selected for both their activity and accessibility. We establish the range of activity which is achievable with this type of catalyst, placing important boundaries on process conditions. We find that an industry standard vacuum gas oil (VGO) cracking activity test, namely the fluid bed simulated test, not only predicts plastic cracking activity, but is also a very good indicator for propylene selectivity. Historical data gathered by industrial researchers might therefore prove highly useful in identifying more active and selective plastic cracking catalysts, offering concrete guidance on catalyst selection. This finding further suggests that the active sites critical for cracking of VGO are of similar importance for plastic cracking. However, we find that various characterization techniques including physisorption, contaminant analysis and determination of external acidity do not offer concrete guidance on catalyst selection. This work therefore demonstrates the limitations of routine catalyst characterization as an indicator of performance, but showcases how established activity metrics can aid in the transition of the chemical industry to recycled feedstocks.",YES,NO,"Catalyst-mechanism-centered study with no reported oil composition or detailed liquid product data, focusing instead on catalyst activity and selectivity metrics.",CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: A strategy for enhancing value creation from pyrolysis gas and oil, derived from plastic waste, through the generation of two additional outputs of solid carbon and hydrogen was investigated. Three types of hard-to-recycle plastic waste (marine plastic litter, household mixed plastics and cosmetic products packaging) were thermally treated in two stages: (i) decomposition of feedstock into gas and oil via pyrolysis at 600 °C; and (ii) thermolytic conversion of the pyrolysis gas and a fraction of oil into hydrogen and solid carbon at 1300 °C separately. The thermolysis of both pyrolysis gas and oil fractions predominantly resulted in the production of solid carbon (39–70 wt% per plastic feedstock and carbon content of 91.3–98.6 wt%) and H2-rich gas (H2 yield of 5.9–10.8 wt% per plastic waste feedstock and H2 content of 71.4–97.2 vol% per gas volume). The incorporation of pyrolysis oil into the thermolysis process could enhance the outputs of solid carbon and hydrogen. Characterizations of solid carbon and hydrogen obtained from pyrolysis gas and oil fractions were further conducted. The observed similar properties of H2 and solid carbon from pyrolysis gas and oil supported the feasibility of introducing all the pyrolytic products together into the thermolysis process without condensation of oil. To enhance the value of these solid carbon derived from plastics for practical usage, we utilized the obtained solid carbon as a reinforcing agent for polymer composite foam development. The solid carbon reinforced composite foam displayed great abrasion resistance (wear loss: 240 mg), compression strength (0.347 MPa), and dynamic impact properties (energy returned: 124 J/m and energy absorbed: 57.3 J/m), emphasizing the viability of solid carbon as a nucleating agent and reinforcing filler in polymer foam for cushioning applications.

Hierarchical zeolites showed quite higher activity, with values even six times higher than a standard nanocrystalline sample used as reference (n-HZSM-5). The activity values decreased from LDPE to HDPE due to the occurrence of some degree of branching in the former polymer, which act as preferential cracking sites. The major products were C1–C4 hydrocarbons (in the range 30–70%, mostly C3–C4 olefins) and C5–C12 hydrocarbons (20–60%), whose share depends on both the polyolefin and the catalyst. The amount of C13–C40 hydrocarbons was practically negligible (<1%) due to the high acid strength of the zeolites which promotes end-chain cracking reactions.

Abstract: Biomass and polymeric wastes are becoming more problematic economically and environmentally.

This study aimed to dynamically characterize the co-pyrolysis of hydrothermally treated Chlorella sorokiniana residue (CSR) and waste polymers (polystyrene (PS) and waste tires (WT)) based on their pyrolytic behaviors, kinetics, interaction effects, bio-chars, bio-oils, and in-situ evolved gasses characteristics. The devolatilization of CSR mainly occurred between 150 and 500 °C, while the decomposition of WT and PS appeared between 200–550 °C and 300–550 °C, respectively. The average activation energy was 179.25, 222.82, and 223.12 kJ/mol for the CSR, WT, and PS devolatilization, respectively. The TG-FTIR-detected functional groups included CH (stretching vibration), CH (in-plane & out-of-plane bending vibration), CC, CO2, OH, CO, COOH, CO, and NH3. The TG-MS-detected pyrolytic products were CHO+, CH3O+, C2H3O+, C3H3O+ C3H6O+, C4H3O+, C5H6O+, COOH+, NH3 +, aliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons.

Abstract: The growth in coffee consumption is directly linked to the generation of vast amount of solid wastes such as coffee husk, coffee pulp, coffee silver skin, and spent coffee grounds. Numerous environmental issues and ecotoxicological concerns arise from directly disposing of this waste in landfills or via incineration, attributable to organic constituents such as dioxins, furans, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, and persistent organic pollutants. There is a need for a suitable alternative strategy to resolve these issues and utilize this waste as a functional product, as it is a carbon-rich source with high energy content. This work includes synergetic studies and utilization of online TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS systems to investigate spent coffee ground (SCG) and plastic bottles (PET) co-pyrolysis characteristics and mechanisms. This study examined the product distribution, emission of pollutants, and change in functional groups and composition with temperature during the process to evaluate the optimum proportion and nature of bio-oil and gaseous products. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were also calculated to understand the behavior of SCG-PET blend pyrolysis using a model-free approach and to optimize the process to scale-up to the industrial level. The results revealed that co-pyrolysis of spent coffee grounds (SCG) and PET at high temperatures yields a condensed bio-oil enriched with energy-dense aromatic hydrocarbons, highlighting its potential as a promising drop-in transportation fuel, chemical feed stocks, intermediates, and solvent in different industries. During synergy analysis, positive synergy was observed throughout the temperature range (25–800 °C), indicating the lower energy requirement and enhanced product quality; however, the oxygenated compounds can be further removed by catalytic cracking or hydro-treatment to make it more feasible.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis of plastic with biomass (spent coffee grounds) without clear data on pure plastic oil composition, making it unsuitable for plastic fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Different types of single waste plastics and a range of real-world mixed waste plastics from several different industrial and commercial sources have been processed in a pyrolysis-plasma/catalytic experimental reactor system for the production of hydrogen. The hydrocarbons produced from the pyrolysis stage were catalytically (Ni/MCM-41) steam reformed in a low temperature, non-thermal plasma/catalytic reactor.

Abstract: Typical cracking catalysts, called equilibrium catalyst (E-Cat) are ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite often used with 15% commercial ZSM-5 zeolite additive (ZSM-5(COM)) to boost olefin yield. In this study, similar additive zeolites with different pore sizes and acidic character were synthesized by rapid ageing of precursor solution and used in the co-cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO). Three ZSM-5 zeolites additives with Si/Al ratio 25 (ZSM-5(25)), 50 (ZSM-5(50)) and 75 (ZSM-5(75)) were synthesized and combined with E-Cat to form E-Cat/ZSM-5(25), E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) and E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) respectively.

Abstract: Mesoporous catalysts are currently used in the petroleum and petrochemical industry to convert heavy hydrocarbons into light ones. There is a few papers on iron-pillared clays are available. In the catalytic pyrolysis, it was used a commercial clay fractionated to remove sand and silt and treated to remove soluble salts and the organic fraction. That clay was intercalated with iron or aluminum oligomers and calcined at specific temperatures to form pillars in the layers. The main advantage of the use of pillared clays in catalytic pyrolysis is that their cost is much more reduced than that of zeolite catalysts. All thermal pyrolysis at 500°C have high pyrolysis oil yield (>80%), except for the pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) using zeolite as catalyst. It was observed significant difference in the catalytic pyrolysis of the HDPE at 450°C as the following: zeolite > Al-PILC–450≈Fe-PILC–450> Fe-PILC–300> Al-PILC-Fe-450. The presence of heavy gas oil (HGO) improves the oil yield from both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, which can be attributed to the solvency effect of HGO. Pyrolysis oils were analyzed by GCAR-MS and their profiles were compared to the standard diesel.

Abstract: The proper management of medical waste is a significant global concern, requiring new disposal methods while also recovering energy. This paper explores the viability of energy recovery from medical waste by pyrolysis with a focus on experimentally evaluating the product yield. To conduct the pyrolysis process, an external heating batch reactor was built, where various types of medical waste, including saline bottles, syringes, and medical gloves, were thermally degraded. The main goals of the study were to investigate the effects of varying medical waste mixtures and temperatures on product yields and to determine the physicochemical properties of the produced pyrolytic oil. The maximum yield of liquid products was about 59.5 % at 350 °C for the saline bottle-syringe blend. The maximum liquid yield for the hand gloves-saline bottle blend, hand gloves-syringe blend, and saline bottle-syringe-hand gloves blend was 49 %, 48 %, and 50 %, respectively, at 400 °C. These yields were slightly lower than the saline bottle-syringe blend due to the presence of rubber compound hand gloves in these mixtures.

Abstract: Primary fragmentation during rapid pyrolysis is considered to be the critical size reduction mechanism as it determines the particle size distribution and char conversion rates in the fixed bed gasifier. This study aims to investigate the primary fragmentation behavior of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) pellets during a rapid pyrolysis process. RDF pellets consisted of different blending ratios of cardboard and polyethylene (PE) were produced by a single-pellet densification process. Pyrolysis tests at temperature ranges of 500–700 °C were performed for each pellet type, and the number and particle size of the fragmented particles were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the different composition of RDF causes different particle binding mechanisms that behave differently during pyrolysis. Densification of cardboard particles can maintain the structure of the pellet char at higher temperatures compared to PE, due to the more stable lignin binding mechanism. A modified Fragmentation Ratio (FR) is introduced to quantify the degree of fragmentation. It is shown that a raise of the concentration of PE from 25 to 75 wt% increases the FR value by up to 4.2 times, whereas an increase in pyrolysis temperature from 500 to 700 °C only slightly changes the FR values. It can be concluded that the type of materials in the RDF pellet has a more dominating effect on the fragmentation compared to the pyrolysis temperature. Further, the volatile matter content of pellets shows a linear correlation with the FR value, whereas no clear relation is found in the case of the pellet's mechanical strength.",NO,NO,"The study focuses on fragmentation behavior and char conversion in RDF pellets during pyrolysis, with no mention of liquid/oil product composition or yield data.",NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA

Abstract: The effect of calcium on the synergy evolution mechanism of Zhundong coal and polyethylene (PE) co-pyrolysis was explored by thermogravimetric (TG), fixed-bed experiments, and the ReaxFF simulation method. The weight loss characteristics of coal and PE pyrolysis, obtained through ReaxFF simulations, exhibited good agreement with TG experimental results. The distribution of coal/PE co-pyrolysis products was examined via fixed-bed fast pyrolysis experiments and Reaxff isothermal pyrolysis simulation. The results reveal that calcium substantially reduces co-pyrolysis tar while simultaneously enhancing co-pyrolysis char and gas to varying extents. Besides, the experimental temperature of 973 K and the simulated temperature of 2600 K yield the highest decrease in co-pyrolysis tar, with reductions of 9.52 % and 14.03 %, respectively. It is discovered that the addition of calcium enhances the synergy degree to 100 % between coal and PE molecules, which means that coal molecules become more firmly attached to PE molecular fragments. Additionally, calcium induces polymerization in co-pyrolysis char, causing the char molecules to become larger and increasing their average molecular weight. Ca-containing tars are rich in aliphatic hydrogens, and synergistic molecules prefer light tars, whereas Ca-free tars have a slightly broader range of aromatic hydrogens, and synergistic molecules favor heavy tars, indicating that the addition of calcium may promote the ring-opening process of coal molecules, releasing more branched-chain hydrogen. In the Ca-free and Ca-containing systems, 24.67 % and 29.51 % of the hydrogen content of the coal molecules migrated toward the co-pyrolysis tar, respectively.

Abstract: Artificial marble, a composite material consisting of 40 % (g g−1) Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and 60 % (g g−1) aluminium hydroxide Al(OH)3 , combines the durability and aesthetics of real marble with the lightweight and moldability of plastic. It is the most sought-after synthetic stone in the world, with a production volume of over 1 million t in 2021. However, due to a high level of cross-linking, mechanical recycling of the composite is impossible, while chemical recycling is achievable, yet unprofitable. The only economically viable recycling solution is to retain the value of both the organic and inorganic fraction of the composite. We investigated the pyrolysis and hydrolysis of post-consumer end-of-life artificial marble to identify possible valorization routes, examining the effects of temperature, water content, catalyst presence, and heating style. Temperature directly accelerates thermolysis, and indirectly hydrolysis. The water inherently present in Al(OH)3 drives initial hydrolysis, and temperature expedites inorganic fraction dehydration, increasing local water partial pressure near polymer ester sites. Above 350°C, PMMAeq depolymerizes faster than it hydrolyzes, balancing the effects of temperature on water dehydration with the depletion of available ester sites for hydrolysis. Contrary to intuition, PMMA does not depolymerize to its monomer MMA and then hydrolyze its acid (methacrylic acid); instead, PMMA partially hydrolyzes to poly methacrylic acid (PMAA) while also depolymerizing to MMA. PMAA then dehydrates and degrades, releasing CO and CO2. The optimal method involves a heating ramp that first releases water at 300°C, minimizing hydrolysis, and then favors MMA production at 400°C, achieving a 66 % (g g−1) MMA yield. Regardless of the operative conditions, the inorganic fraction transforms from Al(OH)3 to a γ -alumina precursor, boehmite. Additionally, the remaining polymer in the residue, about 9 % (g g−1), has the required heat capacity for an energy-self sufficient calcination to γ -alumina.

The results showed that the addition of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 reduced the yield of oil from 69.0 wt % to 64.4 wt % and 62.3 wt %, respectively. The modified catalysts of Fe/ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5 exhibited prominent cracking performance, resulting in the decrease of the oil to 63.2 wt % and 61.2 wt %, respectively, corresponding with an increase of gas products from 7.7 wt % to 16.1 wt % and 20.3 wt %, respectively. However, the mesoporous catalysts of Fe/MCM-41 and Ni/MCM-41 tended to preserve the yield of oil to 65.9 wt % and 65.3 wt %, respectively. In terms of the composition of the oils, a higher yield of single ring aromatics was obtained with Fe modified catalysts, while the addition of ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts promoted increased formation of 2 ring aromatics at the expense of single ring aromatics. In addition, the modified catalysts were found to be highly effective at removing bromine from the oils. The Fe modified catalysts exhibited a better debromination performance than Ni modified catalysts, which was in favor of capturing more inorganic bromine and removing bromine from the oils.",YES,NO,The study focuses on catalyst mechanism and bromine removal rather than plastic-specific oil fingerprinting.,CATALYST_MECHANISM_FOCUS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Plastic degradation for recovery of useful products or raw materials is a very interesting alternative for reducing the plastic accumulation. This paper explores the possibility of using refinery facilities to carry out the plastic cracking as well as to take the most of the products obtained. In the present work, LDPE/VGO blends with different percentages of polymer are degraded in presence of a FCC equilibrium catalyst. The reactor used in this study is a laboratory scale sand fluidized bed reactor at 500°C, and a 7:1 catalyst:LDPE/VGO blend ratio in order to simulate the operating conditions in a large scale industrial reactor.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of flame retarded plastics often leads to high concentrations of toxic organobromine compounds in the pyrolysis oil. In this work, we have investigated the pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) over long residence times in a tube reactor with the aim of producing an oil that is free from organobromines. The tube reactor was fitted with a distillation column so that the pyrolysis products could be separated into heavy oil, middle distillate, light oil, and gases. The light pyrolysis products were characterised using GC–MS and GC-FID/ECD, while the total bromine content of the oils was determined by bomb calorimetery. The bromine content of heavy fractions and antimony content of all fractions of pyrolysis (light oil, middle distillates, heavy oil and char) was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic adsorption spectroscopy (ICP-AAS). Heavy oil fractions were characterised using Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDAX), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) techniques. It was found that the light oil produced by the pyrolysis of both flame retarded HIPS and flame retarded ABS mostly consisted of toluene, ethylbenzene, and cumene and had a relatively low bromine content, all of which was inorganic. The middle distillate oils produced by the same plastics had much higher bromine content, but the vast majority of the bromine was inorganic in the form of antimony bromide. The average molecular weights of heavy fractions were affected by the cracking temperature, while the structure of the mentioned fractions did not change considerably with temperature.

Abstract: To address the challenges associated with medical plastic waste and to characterize its heterogeneity, non-recyclability, and potential biohazard risks, this study explored a carbon dioxide (CO2)-assisted pyrolysis process as a sustainable disposal method. Medical plastic waste typically includes polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride. To experimentally evaluate the functional reactivity of CO2, we employed three pyrolysis setups (one-stage, two-stage, and catalytic processes). The technical advantages of using CO2 over inert gases such as nitrogen (N2) were demonstrated through pyrolysis tests. The results showed that energy production was enhanced under CO2 conditions, with catalytic pyrolysis generating 146% more flammable gases compared to pyrolysis in an N2 environment. The use of CO2 also led to a reduction in the formation of toxic chemicals due to improved thermal cracking. The CO2-assisted pyrolysis process exhibited net negative CO2 emissions when a catalyst was present, as a substantial amount of CO2 was consumed during the process.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis has been emerging as a promising chemical recycling technology to convert plastic waste into olefins and aromatics that can be used as alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals and promote the carbon cycle for plastics. However, the above procedure typically suffers from poor selectivity of the target product. Herein, catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin plastics was carried out in a two-stage fixed bed reactor for highly selective production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), over Zn-P/HZSM-5 catalysts. After loading 3.0 wt% Zn and 0.5 wt% P on HZSM-5 catalyst, catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 500 °C achieved the highest liquid yield of 55.9 wt% and exhibited a remarkably high selectivity up to 87.44 % towards MAHs, especially in which the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) content reached 75.16 %. The introduced Zn species decreased Brønsted acid sites while increased Lewis acid sites of HZSM-5, which in turn improved the aromatization activity. Simultaneously, the addition of P decreased the acidity strength, inhibiting the formation of coke and polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons. Furthermore, catalytic co-pyrolysis of LDPE, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were investigated to reveal the synergistic effect in terms of BTEX selectivity. Intriguingly, a high liquid yield of 55.7 wt% can be obtained at a feeding ratio of HDPE:LDPE:PP = 1:1:1, and an enhanced selectivity of MAHs up to 87.66 % was achieved, with the highest BTEX content of 79.89 %.

Abstract: To address the crisis resulting from the unsustainable consumption of oil resources and alleviate global concerns about the accumulation of plastic waste in nature, catalytic pyrolysis has been utilized. Catalytic pyrolysis is a thermochemically efficient capable of converting polymeric wastes into liquid fuel. In this study, the effects of temperature 375–525 °C, catalyst loading percentage in the reactor 2.5–17.5 %, and the crystallinity of the catalyst support 0–100 % on the quality of gasoline produced from the pyrolysis of municipal polymer waste were investigated.

Crystallinity is a parameter that has not been previously examined for its impact on fuel quality. The response surface methodology was employed to optimize the results. The quality of the gasoline produced was assessed by measuring properties such as research octane number, specific gravity, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, flash point, and aniline point.

Abstract: Consumption of diverse plastics has posed an environmental threat because their disposal practices, landfilling and incineration, release toxic chemicals and microplastics into all environmental media. Indeed, heterogeneous matrix of plastic wastes makes them hard to be disposed. As such, this study aimed to introduce an environmentally benign/reliable disposal platform for complete decomposition of plastic wastes. Pyrolysis process was adapted to convert plastics into syngas, and a disposable diaper (DD) was used as model plastic waste, because it is composed of a variety of polymeric materials. Pyrolysis of DD resulted in the formation of gaseous products and pyrogenic oils, composed of (oxygenated) hydrocarbons. Nonetheless, reactivity of CO2 as an oxidant in pyrolysis of DD was negligible. To impart the strong/desired reactivity of CO2, Ni-based catalyst was adopted. Ni catalyst enhanced H2 and CO formations 4 and 15 times more than pyrolysis without catalyst at 700 °C under CO2. The value-added syngas production was originated from the reduction of polymeric waste, and its derivatives including aromatic compounds.

Abstract: Investigating the kinetics and synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics is an effective method to improve the economic revenue of recycling these wastes.

The results indicate that the co-pyrolysis of PW and LDPE reduces the apparent activation energy required for the reaction, with the lowest value of 218 kJ·mol−1 at a PW to LDPE ratio of 1:7. Analysis of the pyrolysis products reveals that as the proportion of LDPE increases, the O/C ratio of PW and LDPE gradually decreases. At a PW to LDPE ratio of 1:7, the O/C ratio reduces to 0.09, resulting in a maximum oil yield of 76 %, 16.24 % higher than the theoretical yield. As the proportion of LDPE increases, the pyrolysis-induced softening of LDPE coats the PW, thereby weakening the synergistic effect. The experiments showed that the highest pyrolysis oil yield and the most substantial synergistic effect were achieved when the ratio of PW to LDPE was 1:7.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising technology for the production of marketable energy products from waste mixtures, as it decomposes heterogeneous material into homogenous fuel products. This research assessed the ability of slow pyrolysis to convert three waste streams, composed of fibre residues contaminated with different plastic mixtures, into char and tarry phase products at three different temperatures (300, 425 and 550°C). The products were characterised in terms of mass yield, higher heating value (HHV) and gross energy conversion (EC). Significant amounts of hydrocarbon plastics in the feed materials increased the calorific values of the char (up to 32.9MJ/kg) and tarry phase (up to 42.8MJ/kg) products, comparable to high volatile bituminous A coal and diesel respectively. For all three waste streams converted at 300°C, the majority of the energy in the feedstock was recovered in the char product (>80%), while deoxygenation of fibre component resulted in char with increased calorific value (up to 31.6MJ/kg) being produced. Pyrolysis at 425°C for two of the waste streams containing significant amounts of plastic produced both a valuable char and tarry phase, which resulted in an EC greater than 74%. Full conversion of plastic at 550°C increased the tarry phase yield but dramatically decreased the char HHV. The influence of temperature on product yield and HHV was discussed based on the pyrolysis mechanisms and in relation to the plastic composition of the waste streams.",YES,NO,"Co-pyrolysis of fibre residues with plastic mixtures, with no clear data on pure plastic oil composition or detailed liquid product fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a thermochemical route for converting waste plastics into hydrocarbons that might be further upgraded to fine chemicals via the process such as hydrotreatment. In this study, the pyrolysis of five typical plastics (PE, PP, PVC, PS and PET) and steam reforming of their derived volatiles were coupled in one process, named as pyro-reforming. The reaction behaviors, especially the property of their derived cokes, in the pyro-reforming were investigated. The results indicated that the volatiles from the pyrolysis of PE had the highest reactivity with steam to produce H2 of the highest yield, followed by that of PP, PVC, PET and PS. The Cl in PVC promoted nickel sintering, enhanced formation of heavy aromatics through aromatization. Moreover, the existence of Cl interrupted formation of carbon nanotube, forming the highest amount of coke with hemp rope-like fiber form of very coarse surface. This was very different from the carbon nanotube form of coke with smooth surface and uniform outer/inner diameters from the pyro-reforming of PE or PP.

Abstract: Crystallization of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been performed under hydrothermal conditions from silanized protozeolitic units. The role of amine and phenyl groups present in the organosilanes, as well as the use of dipodal silanization agents, on the creation of mesoporosity in the zeolite samples has been investigated. The presence of amine groups and dipodal moieties in the organosilane increases their interactions with the protozeolitic nanounits in the gel, which results in hierarchical zeolites showing enhanced secondary porosity and a higher degree of modification of the textural properties. Nevertheless, dipodal organosilanes hinder strongly the aggregation of the nanounits, leading to non-completely crystalline materials. In contrast, the combination of phenyl and amine groups into a single organosilane has shown to be effective for the generation of more uniform mesopores. Thus, N-(2-N-Benzylaminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Ph-2A) has been found as the best silanization agent, affording a hierarchical zeolite with a narrow mesopore size distribution and a high concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites. Moreover, during LDPE catalytic cracking in TGA tests, the latter material allowed the conversion of the polymer to occur in a narrow temperature range as a consequence of its more uniform acid and textural properties.

Abstract: To overcome the diffusion limitations of DZSM-5 and increase the yield of hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil, a structurally tailored hierarchical catalyst was synthesized via alkaline treatment and waste biomass-derived lignin-assisted reassembly. The physicochemical properties, such as the crystallinity, porosity, acidity and morphology, were characterized with various methods. The catalytic activities were evaluated with various lignin doping contents and lignin-to-LDPE ratios. Additionally, the product distributions, reaction mechanisms and reusability were also investigated. A detailed experiment suggested that lignin significantly increased the porosity of the hierarchical catalyst and led to the formation of a well-developed micro-mesoporous structure via lignin doping reassembly, which facilitated the passage of pyrolysis volatiles. Additionally, the increased porosity and intracrystalline mesoporosity of the material resulted in excellent dehydrogenation, decarbonylation and β-O-4 cleavage activities. Lower lignin doping levels produced olefins and alkylbenzenes and inhibited PAH formation; in contrast, higher lignin loadings facilitated aromatics and BTXE formation. A synergistic effect between the lignin and LDPE was observed for HCs formation with enhanced hydrogen transfer and Diels-Alder reactions. The optimal 0.50 % C@DZSM-5 exhibited excellent catalytic activity, with a hydrocarbon yield of 71.29 % and an olefin selectivity of 30.78 % at a lignin-to-LDPE ratio of 1:1.

Abstract: Waste plastic cracking oils (WPCO) are currently being considered as potential green feedstock for petrochemical/refinery industries in order to promote chemical recycling. However, the WPCO is a very complex material that does not meet the limits of petrochemical processes. In order to assess the possibility of using WPCO as raw material, a comprehensive analytical characterization and distillation of two wide-boiling WPCO samples from the industry was performed. Fractions boiling in typical ranges were prepared: naphtha (30–180 °C), heavy naphtha (30–250 °C), middle distillate (180–350 °C), and atmospheric residue (> 350 °C). Moreover, other distillation cuts were prepared by distilling every 10 wt% as a separate fraction. We performed a study on the distribution of parameters in narrow fractions. The content of aromatics increased with the boiling temperature in the cases of WPCO-1, but decreased for WPCO-2. WPCO-2 had lower alkanes and final boiling point (FBP) compared to WPCO-1. None of the distillation cuts are suitable for “stand-alone” processing on the steam-cracker without additional treatment.

This study examined the influence of the active metal components (Ni and Fe), catalyst pre-reduction, and pre-deoxygenation of pyrolysis volatiles on the catalytic performance and mechanism. Results show that the reductive constituents in pyrolysis volatiles make it difficult to reduce the Fe oxides, thus hindering the CNTs growth on Fe catalysts, compared to Ni catalysts. H2 pre-reduction of Ni and Fe catalysts enhances the generation of CNTs and syngas. The pre-reduced Fe catalyst exhibits better carbon deposit performance, reaching 263 mg/gplastics. The pre-reduced Ni catalyst better facilitates the reforming reaction of CO2 and H2O, resulting in higher syngas yields of 32.75 mmol/gplastics, with a volume proportion of 94.4 vol%. The addition of the deoxygenation catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 promotes the growth of CNTs with fewer defects and higher graphitization on Ni catalysts. The excess CO2 and H2O generated by the introduction of Ni/HZSM-5 may oxidize the Fe0 on pre-reduced Fe catalysts, inhibiting the growth of CNTs.

The up-/re-cycling of plastic waste through catalytic depolymerization is becoming a sustainable way to reduce economic concerns about production and serious environmental impacts. Here, in the present study an effort has been made for the development of catalysts for efficient recycling of carbonyl group containing polymer waste [Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC)]. The sequential preparation of ZnMIV- and ZnAlMIV- LDHs (layered double hydroxides) (MIV= Zr and Ti) and their respective mixed metal oxide (MMOs) based catalytic materials, has been carried out by one-pot co-precipitation and calcination methods. The structural parameters were examined through the various characterisation techniques including XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, and EDS. The layered structure, high crystalline nature and hexagonal 2D-sheet/flakes like morphology with average particle size ranging from ∼14–51 nm [for LDHs] and ∼6–21 nm [for MMOs] were observed. Depolymerization of PET and PC using LDHs/MMOs catalyst in ethylene glycols (EG) produced bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET) and bisphenol A (BPA) monomers as main products, respectively. The catalyst quantity, concentration of solvent, recyclability of catalysts, reaction duration, and crystallization time have also been further investigated for better yield during catalytic glycolysis.

This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust (PS) with polyolefins (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene, PP) using a solid heat carrier in a rotary kiln to intensify bio-oil production. Thermal degradation behaviours and kinetic analyses revealed significant synergistic interactions: molten polyolefins permeated the biomass matrix, facilitating hydrogen radical transfer that suppressed oxygenated compounds (e.g., phenolics, furans) and enhanced hydrocarbon formation. Optimized pyrolysis with solid heat carrier parameters (570 °C, 8 % filling ratio, 0.45 mm particle size) maximized bio-oil yield (43.1 wt%) from PS. Co-pyrolysis with PE or PP at a 1:2 ratio further increased the bio-oil yield to 53.3 wt%, while reducing oxygenated compounds by over 70 % and significantly enriching aliphatic hydrocarbons (81.2 % with PE; 78.4 % with PP). The effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio governed hydrocarbon selectivity, yielding 30.7-32.4% (C8–C23) alkanes suitable for jet/diesel fuels. The gas calorific value surged to 31.6 MJ/m³ due to the synergistic generation of C₂–C₄ hydrocarbons (45.2 vol%).

Abstract: The study focusses on using virgin grades of low and linear low density polyethylene for pyrolysis route of fuel production, in order to mimic the most common municipal plastic waste components as a desirable feedstock with the future aim of integration plans to petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. The oil produced was assessed for basic properties of fuels and insights are provided as to fuel range of common fossil fuel types that it can replace.

It is found that the diesel range hydrocarbons were the most abundant with the highest total sum for samples extracted from low density polyethylene pyrolysis oil.

Abstract: A two-step catalytic co-pyrolysis (TSCCP) of walnut shell (WNS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was innovatively studied at a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor using HZSM-5 as a catalyst. Various characterization techniques such as FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Van Krevelen diagram were applied to explore structure evolutions of the derived chars aiming at revealing the step-wise co-pyrolysis mechanisms.

Abstract: MSW pyrolysis was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 700 °C and sludge fly ash (SFA) was used as an additive. Only organic fractions of MSW were considered. The yield of the products was compared under three conditions: without SFA, with 5% SFA and with 10% SFA. TG-FTIR was also performed on the single, mixed and SFA fractions of MSW to determine the kinetic parameters of the feedstock. The plastic and rubber fractions were the most useful fractions of MSW. Kinetic analysis showed that addition of SFA resulted in the reduction of the apparent activation energy (E). With SFA pyrolysis, the liquid yield decreased from 20.8% to 6.4% and the gas yield increased from 65.5% to 76.4% with 5% SFA and then, decreased to 73.2% with 10% SFA. The major active species in SFA (CaO, SiO2 and Fe2O3) greatly promoted tar cracking effect, resulting in greater gas and lower liquid yield. Addition of 5% SFA, proved to be the most feasible condition, because of higher H2 yield, lowest char yield and better quality liquid product.

Abstract: Municipal solid waste (MSW) contains significant amounts of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

However, there is very limited work in relation to the influence of pyrolysis process conditions in terms of temperature and heating rate on PAHs formation during pyrolysis of PVC.

With the increase of temperature from 500 to 900°C, HCl yield decreased from 54.7 to 30.2wt.%, while the yields of gases and PAHs in the tar increased. Slow pyrolysis generated higher HCl yield, and lower gas and tar yield than fast pyrolysis; the PAH yield obtained from the slow pyrolysis was much lower compared to fast pyrolysis.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of this research is to produce ethylene and propylene directly from waste plastic.

Abstract: The TG/FT-IR technique has been employed to study the evolution of the gases evolved during the thermal and catalytic decomposition of low density (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). This technique allows to obtain the FT-IR spectra of the gases evolved in situ, as they are generated. The evolution of the gases obtained during the progressive deactivation of the catalysts employed (HZSM5 and HUSY) has also been studied. In the thermal processes the relative intensity of bands related to CH2 respect to those related to CH3 is greater, and the presence of aromatics and olefins is nearly negligible, independently on the branching degree of the polymer. Nevertheless, in the catalytic processes, the composition of the gases evolved depends on the zeolite and the polymer structure. The relative intensity of the bands related to the CH3 group increases at the expense of those related to CH2 indicating, as expected, the reduction in the average molecular weight of the gases evolved during the catalytic process. Higher amounts of alkenes and aromatic compounds were detected with HZSM5 than with HUSY.

Abstract: Pyrolysis has emerged as the primary strategy for recycling waste plastics into oil. However, the low thermal conductivity of plastics results in inefficient heat transfer and extended residence times, which is unfavorable for oil production. Here, a novel method by using thermally stable alkaline molten salt as an effective medium to enhance heat transfer and thermal reaction was proposed. The oil yield exhibited a direct correlation with molten salt alkalinity. NaOH-Na2CO3 system achieved remarkable gas upgrading: >99 % chlorine immobilization coupled with alkali-mediated hydrogen enrichment (H2 ratio > 80 %), enabled by catalytic carbon-alkali interactions. Plastic molecular structures governed product selectivity during molten salt thermal treatment: polyolefins (PE/PP) predominantly yielded α-olefins through promoting β-scission reactions, while polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene decomposition generated aromatic hydrocarbons (BTX, styrene) via enhancing dehydrochlorination and aromatization.

Abstract: Catalytic pyrolysis can transform organic solid waste into high-quality pyrolysis products, in which N-doped biochar is an efficient and economical catalyst. Herein, N-doped activated carbon (NAC) and modified biochar (NZC) loaded with bimetal NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu) were used to catalyze the pyrolysis of Chinese medicinal drug residue and polypropylene in a two-stage reaction system to prepare three-phase products and carbon nanotubes. This indicates that the metal/NAC group catalysts possess a larger SBET, whereas the metal/NZC group has better thermal stability. Under NiCo/NZC catalysis, the abundant yield of short-chain carbon C6-C11(49 %) and aromatic hydrocarbons (39.5 %) suggests strong arylation and secondary cracking capabilities. N-doping improved the surface functional group richness of the catalyst, while the bimetal provided more active electrons, which promoted the generation of carbon nanotubes in the late stage of the pyrolysis process.

Abstract: The study explores the effect of varying molasses proportions as a binder on the characteristics of densified char obtained through the slow co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and Eucalyptus wood waste (Waste low-density polyethylene – Eucalyptus wood (WLDPE–EW) and Waste Polystyrene – Eucalyptus wood (WPS–EW)). Pyrolysis was conducted at 500 °C with a residence time of 120 min, employing plastic to wood waste ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 (w/w). The focus was on how varying the proportion of molasses (10–30 %), influences the physical and combustion properties of the resulting biofuel pellets. Our findings reveal that the calorific value of the pellets decreased from 28.94 to 27.44 MJ/Kg as the molasses content increased. However, this decrease in calorific value was compensated by an increase in pellet mass density, which led to a higher energy density overall. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of solid bridges between particles, facilitated by molasses, effectively decreasing particle spacing. The structural integrity of the pellets, as measured by the impact resistance index, improved significantly (43–47 %) with the addition of molasses. However, a significant change in the combustion characteristics depicted by lower ignition and burnout temperatures were observed due to decrease in fixed carbon value and increase in volatile matter content, as the proportion of molasses increased. Despite these changes, the pellets demonstrated a stable combustion profile, suggesting that molasses are an effective binder for producing biofuel pellets through the densification of char derived from the co-pyrolysis of plastic and Eucalyptus wood waste. The optimized molasses concentration analyzed through multifactor regression analysis was 16.96 % with 28 % WLDPE proportion to produce WLDPE–EW char pellets.

Abstract: To produce isomerized sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fractions through plastic wastes' atmospheric pyrolysis is rarely reported. This study addresses the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over magnetic metal-modified HY zeolite catalysts for producing isomerized alkane-type SAF fractions without requiring external hydrogen in an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor. The findings reveal that a lower Si/Al ratio enhances the formation of acid sites on the HY zeolite, which results in increased olefin conversion and produces oil with alkanes' selectivity achieving 60 area%, especially HY12 shows the best performance. The introduction of three magnetic metal oxides (Fe, Co, and Ni) into HY12 changes the acid site distribution with the strong to weak acid site ratio ranging from 0.18 to 0.31. It elevates isomerized alkanes’ selectivity in the aviation fuel range to more than 50 area%.

Abstract: Glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastic (GFRP) is the composite material of choice for engineers to improve their design, save expenses, and achieve sustainability goals, what leads to generation of a big quantity of GFRP waste (during production or as an end-life-product) that needs to be disposed of safely. In order to valorise GFRP waste, this research aims to recover phenol and acetic acid as high-added value chemical and energy products from the millions of tons of GFRP waste produced annually during the catalytic pyrolysis process. The experiments were performed on glass fibre-reinforced poly(methyl methacrylate)-PMMA (GF/PM) as a common and commercial thermoplastic resin in five stages. In the first stage, the thermal decomposition of the milled feedstock over different percentages of ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst to feedstock in the ranges 0.5–5 wt.% (w/w) was performed using TGA. The generated volatile products from TGA were analysed using TG-FTIR and GC/MS in the second and third stages, respectively. The fourth stage was used to study the kinetic behaviour of catalytic pyrolysis of the feedstock with different catalysts and at different heating conditions using isoconversional models. In the last stage, the experimental thermal decomposition curves were simulated numerically. The results showed that ZSM/GF/PM can decompose significantly in the ranges 320–460 °C.

Abstract: Plastic waste pollution has become a crucial concern in the field of environmental conservation. Catalytic pyrolysis offers an appealing and efficient technology that can convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or valuable chemical products. This provides a practical solution to address the challenges associated with waste management. In this research, an innovative approach of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis was employed in a rotary reactor with solid heat carriers, along with a Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, to simultaneously produce BTX aromatics and hydrogen from polyethylene. Experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. This was achieved by adjusting the metallic nickel loadings on the ZSM-5 support. Next, the effect of Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts and the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio on the selectivity of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil and hydrogen was examined. The results revealed that as the metallic nickel loading increased to 10 wt%, the concentration of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil also increased and reached a maximum of 59.2%. Furthermore, the hydrogen gas fraction in the pyrolysis gas was 58.0 vol% when using the 10Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process.

Abstract: The catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood-polypropylene composite (WPP) over different zeolite catalysts (HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and HUSY) was investigated to obtain the influence of zeolite properties on both product distribution and synergistic effect using Py-GC/MS. The yield of aromatics was in the order: HZSM-5 > HY > HBeta > HUSY. HZSM-5 facilitated the formation of monomethyl aromatics, whereas HBeta and HY tended to promote the formation of polymethyl aromatics due to the larger pore size. The coke yield of HZSM-5 (6.4%) was much lower than those of other zeolites tested (11.4–20.2%), suggesting that the pore size of a zeolite was mainly responsible for coke formation during WPP pyrolysis. The strong synergistic effects between poplar and polypropylene in WPP pyrolysis were observed with all the zeolite catalysts tested as the experimental and calculated product distribution was significantly different. The synergistic effect over HZSM-5 zeolite promoted the selectivity for polyaromatics instead of mono aromatics, whereas the mono aromatics yield was increased by 28% for HBeta and 15% for HY zeolite.

Abstract: The growing volume of plastics waste, compounded with a low recycling rate, has led to an alarming amount of plastics ending up in landfills or being incinerated. While pyrolysis offers a route for plastic waste deconstruction, its product distribution is often broad and poorly controlled due to unselective radical chemistry at high temperatures. We recently demonstrated that rapid pulse Joule-heated catalytic cracking over HZSM-5, combined with small fractions of steam, can achieve high selectivity (>80 %) toward C2-C4 olefins, while significantly reducing coking compared to continuous Joule heating. Here, we investigate how acid catalyst properties, such as silica/alumina ratio, zeolite topology, and catalyst porosity, influence light olefin selectivity during polyethylene deconstruction via rapid pulse Joule heating. We demonstrate that silica-to-alumina ratios of ∼30 yield high light olefin selectivity, and small-pore zeolites favor light olefins at the expense of increased coke formation. To mitigate coking, we synthesize HZSM-5 nanosheets and hierarchical zeolites (MFI, FAU, and CHA).

Abstract: Discarded fishing gear, especially abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing nets (ALDFG), has become a major global problem due to its negative impact on the environment and economy. While efforts are underway to remove ALDFG from the ocean floor, many of these nets get contaminated with marine organisms and sediments, which complicates recycling. Consequently, they often end up in landfills. This study investigates the potential of thermal conversion of discarded fishing nets (DFNs) collected from the Gulf of Thailand for resource recovery. We analyzed the materials and thermal properties of four types of fishing nets such as K-island fishing net (KFN), L-island fishing net (LFN), M-island fishing net (MFN), and U-island fishing net (UFN) using FTIR and TGA. Additionally, pyrolysis experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 400 to 700°C using Py-GCMS. The results showed that polyamide nets (KFN, LFN, MFN) produced substantial yields of caprolactam, exceeding 74 % at 400°C and significantly reduced to 26–60 % at 700°C by thermal cleavage. Furthermore, difference selectivity of N-amide in pyrolyzed products of each fishing net related to netting patterns and presence of contaminants. In contrast, the polyethylene net (UFN) primarily generated alkanes and alkenes, highlighting distinct degradation pathways. Fast pyrolysis of polyamide nets yielded N-amides, particularly caprolactam, a valuable precursor for nylon production with significant market potential. Comparison with conventional caprolactam synthesized from cyclohexanone (66–98 % yield), pyrolysis fishing net could produce 64–86 % of alternative caprolactam. This approach provides an alternative to landfill disposal by converting non-recyclable fishing nets into useful feedstocks, thereby enhancing waste management strategies. Furthermore, the study aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11, 12, 13, and 14 by promoting resource recovery and addressing marine pollution. Future research should assess the carbon footprint of pyrolysis-derived caprolactam compared to traditional production methods, evaluating its role in sustainable manufacturing and low-carbon material recovery.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on caprolactam production from polyamide fishing nets, with oil composition data secondary to target product recovery, and the primary output is not generalizable oil fingerprint data.",TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: The addition of plastics to the steam pyrolysis/gasification of wood sawdust with and without a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated in order to increase the production of hydrogen in the gaseous stream. To study the influence of the biomass/plastic ratio in the initial feedstock, 5, 10 and 20 wt.% of polypropylene was introduced with the wood in the pyrolysis reactor. To investigate the effect of plastic type, a blend of 80 wt.% of biomass and 20 wt.% of either polypropylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene or a mixture of real world plastics was fed into the reactor. The results showed that a higher gas yield (56.9 wt.%) and a higher hydrogen concentration and production (36.1 vol.% and 10.98 mmol H2 g−1 sample, respectively) were obtained in the gaseous fraction when 20 wt.% of polypropylene was mixed with the biomass. This significant improvement in gas and hydrogen yield was attributed to synergetic effects between intermediate species generated via co-pyrolysis. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst dramatically improved the gas yield as well as the hydrogen concentration and production due to the enhancement of water gas shift and steam reforming reactions. Very low amounts of coke (less than 1 wt.% in all cases) were formed on the catalyst during reaction, with the deposited carbonaceous material being of the filamentous type.

Abstract: Chemical recycling of plastic waste to base chemicals via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking of pyrolysis oils shows great potential to overcome the limitations in present means of plastic waste recycling. In this scenario, the largest concern is the feasibility. Are plastic waste pyrolysis products acceptable steam cracking feedstocks in terms of composition, product yields and coke formation? In this work, steam cracking of two post-consumer plastic waste pyrolysis oils blended with fossil naphtha was performed in a continuous bench-scale unit without prior treatment. Product yields and radiant coil coke formation were benchmarked to fossil naphtha as an industrial feedstock. Additionally, the plastic waste pyrolysis oils were thoroughly characterized. Analyses included two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector for the detailed hydrocarbon composition as well as specific analyses for heteroatoms, halogens and metals. It was found that both pyrolysis oils are rich in olefins (∼48 wt%) and that the main impurities are nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, bromine, aluminum, calcium and sodium. Steam cracking of the plastic waste derived feedstocks led to ethylene yields of ∼23 wt% at a coil outlet temperature of 820 °C and ∼28 wt% at 850 °C, exceeding the ethylene yield of pure naphtha at both conditions (∼22 wt% and ∼27 wt%, respectively). High amounts of heavy products were formed when steam cracking both pyrolysis oils, respectively.

Abstract: Pyrolysis oils are the crucial link between waste and chemicals in plastic recycling via pyrolysis. Oils from mixed plastic waste pyrolysis are complex mixtures of organic compounds typically containing impurities of nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine. Therefore, their characterization is challenging. This study presents a tailored two-dimensional gas chromatography method supporting in-depth analysis of the chemical composition. It covers a boiling range from the naphtha cut to the middle distillate. These fractions represent the preferred feedstocks to be substituted by plastic pyrolysis oils in the future. The oil characterization is complemented by elemental analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and simulated distillation. The enhanced separation by two-dimensional chromatography results in significantly higher resolution than conventional one-dimensional methods. The most relevant oil compounds can be clustered, distinguished, and quantified based on compound grouping. Depending on the boiling range of the pyrolysis oils, 77 wt% to 96 wt% of the sample composition can be elucidated. Detecting main heteroatom-containing species such as benzoic acid, ε-caprolactam, acetophenone, and various aromatic nitriles provides detailed information for further pyrolysis oil utilization.

Abstract: The extensive use of plastics in modern life has resulted in a global waste crisis to the environment. Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most popular and hardest plastics to recycle because of its strong C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds. In this report, a tandem conversion process, i.e., hydropyrolysis and subsequent vapor-phase hydrocracking of primary intermediates (Cn>5 alkenes and long-chain alkanes), was conducted via a two-step pressurized flow-through fixed-bed reactor over a CoAl2O4 spinel-derived catalyst. The product distribution could be flexibly tuned by regulating operating parameters in the cascade fixed-bed reactor and Co/Al molar ratio in CoAl2O4 spinel catalysts. Under optimal reaction conditions (0.2 MPa H2, 550 °C for hydropyrolysis in the 1st reactor, 300–325 °C for hydrocracking in the 2nd reactor, 20 s−1 of gas hourly space velocity), the maximum single-pass yields of gasoline (C5-C12) and jet-fuel (C8-C16) range n-alkanes reached 86.0 wt% and 68.1 wt%, respectively.

The catalytic mechanism was discussed. The results show that ZnCl2-activated biochar showed high catalytic selectivity to aromatics during the pyrolysis of plastics at 500 °C, and the content of aromatics was increased to 47.5, 46.8, and 42.4% when respectively catalyzed by Zn/C-I, Zn/C-II, and Zn/C-III.

The results reveal that the catalyst composition and pyrolytic temperature significantly affected the development of CNTs and hydrogen production. The Ni/MgAl2O4 produced the highest hydrogen (73 vol.%) and CNTs yield (374 mg g − 1 plastic) among the monometallic catalysts. Adding Ni to the Mg-based catalyst increased metal particle dispersion and metal-support interactions, resulting in better catalytic activity in proportion to filamentous carbon production. Increasing the Mg–Al concentration could promote CNTs graphitization.

Abstract: Pyrolysis offers a sustainable pathway to recycle plastic waste, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a widely used thermoplastic. However, product distributions from HDPE pyrolysis often vary, even from the experiments conducted at the same temperature and time, highlighting the complex interplay between chemical kinetics and mass transfer. This study investigates HDPE pyrolysis at control pressures at or below 1 atm and temperatures at 500 and 550 °C using a microreactor. The effects of reaction pressure on product formation and escape were examined. Our experiments demonstrated that near-vacuum conditions would give a product distribution closer to that obtained from the kinetic-limited regime representing primary products, where secondary decomposition reactions in the melt and headspace are minimized. In contrast, increasing pressure promotes the formation of lighter hydrocarbons through continued decomposition of the oligomers in the melt phase and of gaseous products in the headspace directly above the vapor–liquid interface, where the latter was found more dominant under our reaction conditions. A Damköhler number analysis quantifies the competition between a species’ mass transfer and its further pyrolysis, showing that at low pressures, volatile products escape rapidly without further pyrolysis, whereas higher pressures decelerate outflow in the headspace, enabling continued decomposition. This work identifies pressure-dependent product cutoffs and provides insights into optimizing pyrolysis conditions for desired product distributions.

The physicochemical properties of diesel, mixed plastic pyrolysis oil (MPPO), and HPO were thoroughly analyzed according to IS standards, enabling a direct comparison and alignment of HPO characteristics with EN590 diesel fuel standards. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified key fuel components—n-alkanes, alkenes, benzene, and naphthalene with HPO showing 98 % compositional similarity to commercial diesel. The HPO blend with various percentage of pure diesel ratio is (30:70, 60:40 and 90:10). The hydroprocessing technique effectively reduced the alkene content of MPPO, enhancing the purity and quality of the resulting HPO. This refinement was crucial in ensuring that the oil met the necessary fuel standards. Engine performance evaluations further indicated that blending HPO with conventional diesel resulted in emissions with 95 % similarity to those of standard diesel fuel. This close match in emission profiles underscores the potential of HPO as a cleaner and more environmentally friendly fuel alternative. Additionally, the increased aromatic content in HPO, due to hydroprocessing, significantly improved combustion properties. This enhancement not only supports the feasibility of using HPO as a substitute for traditional diesel but also suggests that HPO may offer superior performance in specific applications. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of HPO as a sustainable fuel option, capable of addressing the environmental impacts associated with both plastic waste and fossil fuel consumption.

Abstract: Perpetual fast fashion wave, dismal global recycling rate, and poor circularity of textiles urged sustainable textile waste disposal solution in lieu of incineration and landfilling. Herein, textile fast pyrolysis was mooted as a promising solution by dint of its fast disposal rate, mild pollutant emission, and multiple value-added products formation. Following ill-defined thermochemical behaviour of individual textiles, in-depth experimental exploration on textile fast pyrolysis was supplemented by feedstock characterization, product distribution, and product characterization to unravel the effects of feedstock (natural/synthetic) and temperature (500–900oC) variability on pyrolysis products. Textile fast pyrolysis harnessed pyrogas with two variable products, viz. retrievable chars and oils [natural textiles: cotton (C), denim (D), & cashmere/plant fibre (CP)] or non-retrievable chars and waxes [synthetic textiles: polyester (P), P/acrylic (PA), & P/cotton (PC)]. Melting and high aromaticity of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) rendered the synthesis of non-retrievable chars and waxes, separately. Given monotonic char yields (7.31–24.19 wt%) reduction with temperature, the oil/wax (53.19–75.19/60.46–70.52 wt%) and gas (13.44–33.67 wt%) yields were negatively correlated to each other.

Abstract: Experiments and artificial neural network modeling were performed to investigate the effect of operating parameters (temperature, fluidization velocity, and particle size) and catalysts (HZSM-5, red mud, Fe2O3, and dolomite) on co-pyrolysis of bamboo with polystyrene (PS) in a fluidized bed reactor for upgrading bio-oil. The synergistic effect was revealed by analyzing products via various analytical techniques and differences between theoretical and actual co-pyrolysis results. Under the H2-donor source from PS, co-pyrolysis reduced the O content while enhancing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons and higher heating value (HHV) of oil. Depending on the type of catalyst, characteristics and yield of the co-pyrolysis oil were affected along with the proposed reaction pathways. Dolomite was assessed as the most effective catalyst for improving oil quality, with the highest HHV (34.1 MJ/kg) and highest pH value (5.0). An artificial neural network using a back propagation algorithm in Matlab software was applied to predict the liquid yield and HHV of oil.

Abstract: Ex-situ co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse pith and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated over zeolite-based catalysts using a tandem micro-reactor at an optimised temperature of 700 °C. A combination of zeolite (HZSM-5) and sodium carbonate/gamma-alumina served as effective catalysts for 18% more oxygen removal than HZSM-5 alone. The combined catalysts led to improved yields of aromatic (8.7%) and olefinic (6.9%) compounds. Carbon yields of 20.3% total aromatics, 18.3% BTXE (benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene), 17% olefins, and 7% phenols were achieved under optimal conditions of 700 °C, a pith (biomass) to PET ratio of 4 and an HZSM-5 to sodium carbonate/gamma-alumina ratio of 5. The catalytic presence of sodium prevented coke formation, which has been a major cause of deactivation of zeolite catalysts during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.

Abstract: Plastic waste is steadily polluting oceans and environments. Even if collected, most waste is still predominantly incinerated for energy recovery at the cost of CO2. Chemical recycling can contribute to the transition towards a circular economy with pyrolysis combined with steam cracking being the favored recycling option for the time being. However, today, the high variety and contamination of real waste remains the biggest challenge. This is especially relevant for waste fractions which are difficult or even impossible to recycle mechanically such as highly mixed municipal plastic waste or marine litter. In this work, we studied the detailed composition and the steam cracking performance of distilled pyrolysis oil fractions in the naphtha-range of two highly relevant waste fractions: mixed municipal plastic waste (MPW) considered unsuitable for mechanical recycling and marine litter (ML) collected from the sea bottom. Advanced analytical techniques including comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) coupled with various detectors and inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were applied to characterize the feedstocks and to understand how their properties affect the steam cracking performance. Both waste-derived naphtha fractions were rich in olefins and aromatics (~70% in MPW naphtha and ~51% in ML naphtha) next to traces of nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine and metals. ICP-MS analyses showed that sodium, potassium, silicon and iron were the most crucial metals that should be removed in further upgrading steps. Steam cracking of the waste-derived naphtha fractions resulted in lower light olefin yields compared to fossil naphtha used as benchmark, due to secondary reactions of aromatics and olefins. Coke formation of ML naphtha was slightly increased compared to fossil naphtha (+ ~50%), while that of MPW naphtha was more than ~180% higher. It was concluded that mild upgrading of the waste-derived naphtha fractions or dilution with fossil feedstocks is sufficient to provide feedstocks suitable for industrial steam cracking.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on steam cracking of distilled pyrolysis oil fractions from mixed plastic waste, with no detailed oil composition data from the pyrolysis stage itself, and the primary focus is on olefin production and steam cracking performance rather than plastic-to-oil fingerprinting.",CO_PYROLYSIS;TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO

Abstract: Plastic waste, particularly from polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE), poses an escalating environmental burden due to its chemical inertness and volume. Pyrolysis is commercialized process that offers a practical solution for recycling plastic waste, but it is limited by high temperature requirements, substantial energy consumption, and high proportion of olefinic products. Hydrocracking with bifunctional catalysts under optimized conditions presents a promising alternative. Here, we developed a property-optimized Ru/Beta catalyst system combined with a pressurized open batch distillation reactor for the selective hydrocracking of waste PE into C5–C30 hydrocarbons. Zeolite Beta supports with varied Si/Al ratios and crystal sizes were synthesized to control Brønsted acid site distribution and external surface area. The controlled properties influenced Ru nanoparticle dispersion, hydrogen activation, and overall catalytic activity. Nano-sized zeolite Beta supports exhibited the highest Ru dispersion and facilitated efficient hydrocracking. The open batch reactor configuration enabled real-time vapor-phase separation of volatile products, minimizing secondary cracking. Under optimized conditions (280 °C, 40 H2 bar), Ru/nanosized Beta with (Si/Al=10) achieved over an 80 % PE conversion and a 50 % selectivity toward C5–C30 liquid hydrocarbons.

Abstract: Multilayer polymer films (MFs) containing poly(ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVOH) and polyolefins are ubiquitous in single-use food and medical packaging. MFs are currently landfilled or incinerated rather than mechanically recycled because of the processing difficulties associated with their form factor and complex multicomponent structures. Advanced chemical recycling is a promising solution. Prior reports have explored hydrogenolysis and hydrodeoxygenation to convert EVOH, but these technologies are limited by catalyst deactivation and slow apparent kinetics, respectively. Alternatively, in this work, we demonstrate the efficient hydrocracking of commercial MFs into naphtha range (C5-C12) alkanes over platinum (Pt) supported on acidic zeolites. Mixtures of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and EVOH are utilized as MF surrogates to gain fundamental insights. Pt deposited on BEA supports with varying Lewis acid site (LAS) concentrations are synthesized and tested for hydrocracking. Surprisingly, Pt/BEA with high LAS concentrations demonstrates improved activity for LPDE/EVOH blends over LDPE alone. In contrast, LAS concentrations are shown to have no influence on LDPE hydrocracking. LAS and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) catalyze the dehydration of EVOH to form water, which improves LDPE hydrocracking. Polyaromatics formed primarily via EVOH thermal degradation lead to detrimental coke formation, which hinders hydrocracking activity. Reaction conditions and feed ratios of LDPE and EVOH are tuned to balance these competing effects. Reusability tests demonstrate that Pt/BEA maintains high activity (81% conversion in 2 h) and high selectivity towards naphtha (78%) over multiple reuse cycles.

Abstract: Pyrolysis offers a promising solution to converting plastic waste into high-value products. However, the impact and mechanism of plastic additives in regulating the pyrolysis of different plastic types remain unclear. To address this gap, this study first investigates the differences in structure, thermal stability, and decomposition kinetics of five common chlorine-free plastics and their corresponding virgin polymers. Subsequently, microwave catalytic pyrolysis is employed as the core methodology to analyze the distribution and composition of pyrolysis products under a fixed condition (microwave power of 800 W and a plastic-to-HZSM-5 catalyst ratio of 8:3). The results indicate that Na2SO4 and CaCO3 are the main additives used in HDPE and PP plastics. Na2SO4, with a higher thermal conductivity than HDPE, enhances heat transfer, resulting in a faster pyrolysis rate for shopping bags (HDPE plastic). CaCO3 adsorbs intermediates formed during the pyrolysis of water pipes (HDPE plastic), altering the reaction pathway and promoting chain scission. Consequently, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) increase in shopping bags and water pipes, with relative contents of 81.51 % and 79.96 % in liquid oil, respectively, compared to 67.99 % in virgin HDPE. Conversely, the highly branched structure of PP leads CaCO3 to promote cross-linking reactions during the pyrolysis of woven bags (PP plastic), resulting in macromolecular formation. This increases activation energy and decreases the MAH relative content in the pyrolysis products.

Abstract: Thermochemical methods offer a promising solution for converting waste plastics into high-value fuels or chemicals, helping to reduce plastic accumulation in the environment and promote sustainable development. However, existing methods typically require secondary processing to effectively produce low-carbon olefin (C2-C4) monomers, such as ethylene and propylene, making true closed-loop recycling difficult to achieve.

By optimizing reaction parameters, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins can reach up to 84 %. Increasing the reaction temperature promotes chain hydrocarbon radical cyclization, Diels-Alder reactions, and subsequent dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of aromatic compounds that undergo thermal polycondensation to produce carbon nanospheres with particle sizes ranging from 100 to 180 nm.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is considered to be a promising method to dispose waste plastics by thermal cracking into chemicals. Previous studies focus on pyrolysis recycling of waste thermoplastics.

In order to provide guidance for reactor design and thermo-chemical process management for the pyrolysis recycling of waste thermosetting plastics, the pyrolysis kinetics, volatile products and reaction mechanisms of one typical waste thermosetting plastics namely phenolic fibre-reinforced plastic (phenolic FRP) are studied in the present study. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and online TGA-FTIR-mass spectra (MS) analyses are employed. Results indicate that the pyrolysis of waste phenolic FRP in inert atmosphere may be divided into two stages with the threshold conversion rate of 0.2.

Nonetheless, no previous studies on excavated waste pyrolysis, including the characterisation of the process products, have been identified. Ergo, this study aims at filling this knowledge gap. The pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel formed from excavated waste was performed in a lab-scale reactor in the temperature range of 400–700 °C.

Additionally, the distribution of C, H, N, S, O, and Cl among the process products was analysed. The high content of C2–C3 hydrocarbons was detected in non-condensables, whereas the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was detected among condensable products.

Abstract: Conventional disposal processes (incineration and landfilling) of agricultural plastic wastes release harmful chemicals and microplastics into our ecosystems. To provide a disposal platform not releasing harmful chemicals, pyrolysis of a representative agricultural plastic waste was proposed in this study. Spent plastic mulching film (SMF) was used as a model waste compound. To make pyrolysis process more environmentally benign, CO2 was used as a raw material in pyrolysis of SMF. H2 and hydrocarbons were produced from pyrolysis of SMF under the inert (N2) and CO2 conditions, because SMF is composed of polyethylene. To enhance conversion of hydrocarbons into H2, catalytic pyrolysis of SMF was conducted over Ni/SiO2. Compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis, total concentration of pyrolytic gases was enhanced up to 3.1 and 11.3 times under N2 and CO2 conditions, respectively. The gas phase reactions between CO2 and hydrocarbons led to formation of CO, which enhanced production of pyrolytic gases under the CO2 condition. Moreover, gas phase reactions resulted in less production of pyrolytic oil from CO2 condition (15.9 wt%) in reference to the N2 condition (22.6 wt%). All experimental results confirmed that CO2 and SMF can be used as useful feedstocks to produce value-added products.

Al2O3 presented the highest liquid yield because of its weak acidity, with the liquid product dominated by n-alkanes (78.88%), whereas the yield of the liquid obtained from HZSM-5 as a catalyst support was the lowest, and aromatics was the major component (56.75%). SAPO-11 exhibited excellent selectivity for iso-alkanes, which improved the quality of the liquid oil.

Abstract: Municipal plastic waste (mixtures of high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride) was pyrolyzed in a pilot-scale horizontal tubular reactor. To increase the yield of volatile and to improve the product properties (e.g. reduced chlorine content, better storage and transportation) red mud, calcium hydroxide, and nickel loaded zeolite catalysts were used. The nickel loaded synthetic zeolite catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation. Catalysts with high synthetic zeolite content can increase the yields of light oil roughly by 50%. The char formation was slight under the same used conditions. In case of catalyst free pyrolysis, the gases and light oil contained significant amount of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can occur further corrosion problems. The stability of light oil was followed by aging test. Slight formations of polymerized compounds from unsaturated hydrocarbons were found after the treating in case of catalytic pyrolysis. However, the total acidic number was moderate-high without catalyst. Regarding the catalysts, the concentration of chlorinated compounds can be drastically reduced in the presence of catalysts. Especially, when high ratios of the red mud and calcium hydroxide were used. Therefore, the total acid number could be also reduced.

Abstract: Pyrolysis presents a promising pathway for the chemical recycling of waste plastics. However, the pyrolysis of chlorine-containing plastics can generate hazardous chlorinated compounds. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the migration, transformation, and removal of chlorine during pyrolysis to enable environmentally sustainable recycling. In this study, we combined kinetic analysis with in-situ FTIR and TG-FTIR-MS to elucidate the mechanisms of chlorine migration and transformation during the pyrolysis of chlorinated mixed plastics (CMPs). An efficient dechlorination process using calcium-based additives was also developed. The results indicate that the pyrolysis of CMPs occurs in two distinct stages (Stage Ⅰ and Stage Ⅱ), with average apparent activation energies (Ea) of 166.69 kJ/mol and 243.86 kJ/mol, respectively. The process followed mechanism functions involving diffusion, nucleation, and phase boundary reactions. Initially, weak C–Cl and C–H bonds ruptured preferentially, releasing HCl. This was followed by synergistic cleavage of the main C–C chains, generating radicals such as methyl (·CH₃), butyl (·C₄H₉), propylene (·C₃H₅), and phenyl (·C₆H₅). The combination of these radicals with free chlorine radicals (·Cl) resulted in the formation of diverse and complex chlorinated organic compounds. For dechlorination, Ca(OH)₂ was identified as the optimal calcium-based additive, achieving a chlorine removal efficiency of 97.75 %, attributed to its self-decomposition behavior.

Abstract: The growing accumulation of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has raised great concern about its effective upcycling. Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a promising method for selectively upcycling of waste PET into aromatics. However, the high temperature and poor mass transfer performance remain considerably challenging. In this research, a diffusion-enhanced hollow ZSM-5 catalyst with Ru modification was designed for low-temperature valorization of waste PET into aromatics. Ru species significantly enhanced the primary depolymerization of long-chain polymers by generating abundant Lewis acid sites, which markedly increased the aromatics content. Additionally, the mesopore-rich structure formed after Ru-modification improved diffusion capacity of products effectively. The existing of active Ru0 species was beneficial to the hydro-upgrading of oxygen-containing intermediates, therefore monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) content and hydrogen atom utilization increased to a great extent. More gratifyingly, the pyrolysis temperature for preparing aromatics from waste PET was obviously lowered, probably due to the synergistic effect of diffusion-enhanced structure and Ru modification. Ru/ZH exhibited higher aromatics yield of 46.4 wt% with selectivity of 95.3 % at 500 °C, resulting in a significant mass yield increase of 93.1 % compared to unmodified hollow ZSM-5 (24.0 wt%).

Abstract: The present study aims to improve the yields and selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass by the addition of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which has a higher hydrogen-carbon ratio than biomass. We have investigated the thermal decomposition behavior and kinetics, as well as the product distribution, of the co-pyrolysis of biomass (cellulose and pine sawdust) and plastic (LDPE) both with and without a catalyst (HZSM-5) using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Our results, based on the weight loss difference (△W), show that there is a positive and synergistic interaction between the biomass and LDPE. After the addition of LDPE, the synergistic reactions inhibited catalyst coking effectively and decreased the formation of solid residues. In addition, the ZSM-5 catalyst improved the reaction activity and reduced the activation energy, although the reaction mechanism is not changed. At the same time, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method was used to fit the kinetic data for both non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE, and the activation energies (E a) of the cellulose + LDPE + catalyst and pine + LDPE + catalyst systems were found to be 168.81 and 185.87 kJ/mol, respectively.

The CFB was designed to provide heat from the combustor (semi-riser type) to the pyrolyzer (bubbling fluidized bed (BFB)) through heat carriers in high efficiency. A 100 kg/day scale system, including an oil condensation facility, was constructed and operated continuously for 34.5 hrs. Pelletized polypropylene was supplied to the pyrolyzer as plastic waste.

Abstract: Today, the amount of plastic waste is increasing due to the use of more plastic. Since these wastes are composed of complex chemical compounds, when they are stored, they are difficult to degrade in the air, water and soil environment and pose a serious environmental problem. One of the disposal methods of plastic waste is pyrolysis, where valuable and useful products are obtained.

Abstract: It is crucial to develop a simple and rapid process for producing iso-alkane-rich sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without relying on external hydrogen supply. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) for SAF fractions production using zeolite catalysts including HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and MCM-41 in both in-situ and ex-situ modes. The results demonstrate that the HY catalyst yields the highest isomeric SAF fractions (31 area%) in the in-situ mode, whereas the HBeta exhibited maximal aromatic SAF selectivity (65 area%) in ex-situ mode, with complete absence of iso-alkanes. In the in-situ mode, the brief contact between iso-alkanes and acid sites on catalyst effectively suppresses the secondary cracking. However, for zeolites such as ZSM-5 with high acid concentration, isomerized alkanes are still difficult to retain. These results indicate that the effective production of iso-alkanes must be conducted under in-situ mode and requires zeolites with well-balanced acidity. The optimized distribution of acid sites in HY zeolite is found to be LAS/BAS = 3.42, which enhanced the production of iso-alkanes. Moreover, while the type of SAF fractions remained unchanged regardless of the polyolefin plastic used, polypropylene (PP) exhibited greater aromatic selectivity owing to its methyl-branched structure.

This study examines the isothermal thermal degradation kinetics and batch pyrolysis behaviors of bakelite, along with its blends with PP and HDPE, emphasizing the characterization of pyrolytic oils for designing optimized reactors. For the study on isothermal thermal degradation kinetics, isothermal thermogravimetric analysis was performed at specified temperatures (300, 350, 400, 450, and 500°C), chosen based on the predominant non-isothermal degradation behavior of bakelite. The batch pyrolysis of discarded bakelite and blended bakelite with PP/HDPE is carried out at 450°C. The chemical composition analysis of pyrolytic oils is performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, with comprehensive compound analysis conducted using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). Isothermal thermogravimetry at temperatures ranging from 300°C to 500°C reveals increased thermal degradation with rising pyrolytic temperatures, reaching maximum weight losses of 55 % for bakelite, 82.74 % for PP-bakelite blends, and 90.8 % for HDPE-bakelite blends at 500°C.

First, screening tests were performed using five reject materials and four catalysts in an analytical scale and then, a selection of catalyst and reject materials were evaluated in lab-scale followed by a techno-economic assessment. Experimental results indicated that the conversion was more efficient if the reject had high content of plastics compared to fibers, leading to products with increased heating value, higher hydrocarbon yield and less reactive oxygenates compared to the rejects with low plastic ratio.

Abstract: In this study, the thermal degradation of a waste fraction of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene containing brominated flame retardants was performed to reduce halogen content in the pyrolysis oil. Thermal degradation was completed using Ca-based additives (calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide and oyster shells) in a bench-scale pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor and char separation system.

Abstract: The pyrolysis of vacuum residue (VR) using polypropylene (PP) under supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) conditions represents a novel approach to converting this abundant and difficult-to-process feedstock into lighter liquid products. In this paper, a set of experiments was performed to analyze the impact of scCO2, PP and steam on the yields of pyrolysis products (i.e., liquid, gas and coke) and characteristics of the liquid fractions. The findings indicated notable improvements when scCO2 was used instead of subcritical CO2 in the pyrolysis of VR with PP. These included decreased viscosity and improved API gravity, alongside increased maltene yield and reduced coke yield. Furthermore, the inclusion of PP markedly elevated the quality of the obtained liquid, whereas steam + scCO2 primarily affected the product distribution by raising the yield of coke and gas fractions. VR pyrolysis under scCO2 conditions at 380 °C, 8 MPa, PP/VR ratio of 0.23 for 60 min in a batch system, without the use of catalyst, resulted in the highest liquid yield of 83.7 ± 1.9 wt%, and minimum coke yield of 9.8 ± 1.3 wt%. Under these conditions, the upgraded liquid consisted of 75.2 wt% light and middle distillates with boiling points below 350 °C. Additionally, the proportion of oxygenates in the pyrolysis oil reduced by 60.5 %, improving its heating value.

Abstract: The catalytic degradation of linear low-density (lldPE) polyethylene over HY-zeolite catalyst was studied in a semi-batch reactor. One of the important problems encountered during catalytic pyrolysis of macromolecules is the contact with the catalyst, which is known to affect the product distribution and the quality of the coke formed. A pre-degradation procedure was introduced to achieve efficient contact between the LLDPE macromolecules and the catalyst. The influence of the pre-degradation to the reaction conditions including holding time, temperature, polymer to catalyst ratio and flow rate of carrier gas was examined. Moreover, the pre-degradation results were compared with the results obtained using normal mixing procedure. The results obtained showed that, pre-degradation promotes the liquid fraction by a factor of more than one-fold increase at the expense of the gas fraction and the coke yield. The optimal liquid fraction with pre-degradation was obtained at low reaction temperature and catalyst amount respectively, i.e. high polymer to catalyst ratio, making it economically viable method for the degradation of lldPE. The coke content was analysed using TGA in nitrogen atmosphere to remove the soft coke and then in air isothermally at the final temperature to burn the hard coke. The TGA results of the coked sample show less concentration of coke components on the catalyst using the pre-degradation method as compared to the normal mixing which shows high concentration of coke components especially at low reaction temperature. Moreover, the majority of the coke components produced using the pre-degradation method were soft coke, making it more efficient for the re-usability of the catalyst.

Abstract: The potential use of activated char obtained from the pyrolysis of a mixture of non-recyclable plastics for the adsorption of CO2 in fixed-bed columns has been explored. The rejected fraction of plastics collected in a municipal solid treatment plant was pyrolyzed and the resulting char residue was activated to develop a porous carbonaceous material. The dynamic behavior of CO2 adsorption was assessed by the breakthrough curves obtained in continuous column tests. Among all the available models, the curves were successfully fitted to the dose-response model. The effect of adsorption temperature (15–45 ºC), the inlet CO2 concentration (10–40 %, vol.), and the adsorbent length of the bed (loadings, 1–2 g) on the efficiency of the process was evaluated by the surface response methodology applying an adaptative neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative approach for plastic wastes valorization towards light olefins in a novel reactor design, which avoids the use of high temperatures (800–900 °C) and zeolite catalysts, as is the case in thermal and catalytic cracking, respectively. Thus, the steam cracking of HDPE was studied in a fountain confined spouted bed reactor (FCSBR) using γ-alumina as in-bed catalyst due to its moderate activity for hydrocarbons cracking reactions and relatively low cost. This reactor design enables operation with continuous plastic feed without defluidization problems and preventing elutriation of fine catalyst particles. The cracking temperature was optimized between 650 and 750 °C to maximize the production of valuable chemicals, such as light olefins and BTX. The results showed that high temperatures enhance the breaking down of long chain hydrocarbons into shorter compounds, narrowing the product distribution. The product stream was composed of mainly C2-C4 olefins, with a maximum yield of 40.3 wt% at 700 °C. Propylene was the major olefinic compound at 650 °C (15.9 wt%), but the distribution shifted towards ethylene (24.5 wt%) at 750 °C, at the expense of decreasing the content of C3-C4 paraffins and olefins. Apart from typical cracking products, CO and CO2 were also obtained, yielding 4.9 and 15.9 wt% at 750 °C. In addition to promoting cracking and steam reforming reactions, high temperatures also favoured other secondary reactions. Thus, Diels-Alder cyclization and condensation reactions were observed, leading to a BTX yield of 16.7 wt% at 750 °C. Considering the combined yield of all high-value chemicals, 700 °C turned out to be the optimum temperature, enabling to recover 53.5 wt% of high added value products.

Pyrolysis experiments were conducted using a microwave oven at a power of 450 W and a temperature of 600 °C. Graphite susceptor (10 g) was used to achieve the required pyrolysis conditions. In addition, the design of experiments (DoE) with machine learning (ML) was used to understand the loading of PS (5 g, 27.5 g, and 50 g), and KOH (5 g, 7.5 g, and 10 g). The products including oil, gas, and char were collected in every experiment. The average heating rates achieved were in the range of 30–50 °C/min. The specific microwave power (microwave power per unit mass of feedstock) decreased with an increase in PS amount from 90 to 9 W/g. However, the specific microwave energy (microwave energy per unit mass of feedstock) (27–73 kJ/g) was in line with the average heating rate.

Abstract: Although biodegradable straws are widely used, they are often unsuitable for disposal in open environments and cannot be recycled in the same manner as conventional plastic straws. Hence, an effective disposal method needs to be developed. Herein, the thermochemical conversion of biodegradable straws made mostly of polylactic acid (PLA) was considered, and the effects of CO2 on the characteristics of thermochemical products produced from biodegradable straws were explored. The thermochemical conversion of the biodegradable straw in CO2 atmosphere yielded more non-condensable gases than the thermochemical conversion in N2 owing to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles at 800 °C. At temperatures > 600 °C in CO2, the reverse water-gas shift reaction considerably increased the CO selectivity. Using CO2 in the thermochemical conversion decreased yields of char and wax, which was attributed to CO2 enhancing thermal cracking of volatiles evolved during the thermochemical conversion and C–H and O–H bonds present in the feedstock. The CO2 thermal agent promoted the cleavage of the polymeric bond of PLA to produce up to 14-fold more lactic acid (the monomer of PLA) than that produced with N2 agent, while it suppressed radical reactions to produce fewer phenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Abstract: In the thermal conversion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and carbon-containing resources, chlorine has seriously harmed environmental safety, human health and chemical equipment.

In this work, the chlorine migration characteristics during the co-pyrolysis of PVC and low-rank coals were studied by fixed bed pyrolysis experiment, thermogravimetric-mass spectrometer (TG-MS) and in situ pyrolysis time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-TOF-MS), and the distribution and release behavior of chlorine in each product was investigated by changing the pyrolysis temperatures, mixing ratios and coal types. The results showed that the co-pyrolysis process inhibited the release of HCl and chlorine migrated from HCl to char and co-pyrolysis water during the co-pyrolysis process. The co-pyrolysis water influenced the release and migration of chlorine in different aspects. At the later stage (around 410–550 °C) of co-pyrolysis, the relatively stable Car-Cl bond broke and formed HCl. In addition, the chlorine fixing capacity of minerals in low-rank coals was depended on the species and quantity of minerals that react with HCl directly, and their chlorine fixing capacity reached the upper limit when the mixing ratio was 8:2. Variations of other compounds (containing N, S) also affected the chlorination reactions. The relationship between chlorine distribution, chlorine release, chlorine transformation, and external conditions during co-pyrolysis was established and the targeted regulation of chlorine was proposed based on the above conclusions.

Different concentrations of sodium hydroxide additive were used in situ to neutralize the corrosive inorganic bromine species released during the reactions. It appeared that supercritical water conditions lowered the decomposition temperature of both the fire-retardant DDE and HIPS. The reaction products included oils (up to 76wt%), char (up to 18wt%) and gas (up to 2.4wt%) which was mainly methane.

Abstract: As the consumption of plastic materials has been dramatically increased, the abundant presence of their debris has become a significant problem worldwide. Thus, this study proposes a sustainable plastic conversion platform for energy recovery. In detail, polystyrene pyrolysis was examined as a case study under CO2 atmosphere in reference to N2 condition. The major gaseous and liquid products from polystyrene pyrolysis include permanent gases (syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons) and condensable aromatic compounds. Under CO2 environment, the reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was achieved during polystyrene pyrolysis, in comparison with N2 condition. Since its slow reaction kinetics, conversion of condensable hydrocarbons into permanent gases was not fully activated. Therefore, a cheap industrial waste, steel slag (SS), was employed as a catalyst to increase reaction kinetics. The synergistic effects of SS and CO2 contributed to doubling H2 production, while CO formation increased more than 300 times, in reference to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Because CO2 acted as an oxidant for CO production, control of H2/CO ratio was achieved in different conditions. Thus, the utilization of CO2 would suggest a promising way to reduce the formation of PAHs, adopting the reliable platform to produce syngas from plastic waste.",YES,NO,"Main focus is on syngas (H2 and CO) production and PAH reduction, with oil not being a central product or characterized in detail.",TARGET_HYDROGEN;TARGET_AROMATICS;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Mattresses are a difficult waste to manage in landfills due to their large volume and low density. Pyrolysis treatment could reduce its volume while producing fuel or products valuable for the chemical industry. Pressurized pyrolysis at 400, 450, and 500 °C is carried out in a lab-scale autoclave at initial pressures 4.2, 8.4, and 16.8 bar. Product gas yield increases slightly along with elevated pressure as well as temperature. However, beyond 8.4 bar the initial pressure makes no discernible differences. CO and CO2 are the major gas species followed by CH4. CO contributes the most to the product gas energy content followed by C3 species, C2H6, and H2. Calculated energy content (heating value) is between 2 and 15 MJ·Nm−3. In terms of product gas energy content, low pressure pyrolysis is favorable over high pressure pyrolysis. According to integration areas of chromatographic measurements the liquid phase contains up to 25 % of N-compounds, with benzonitrile being the most abundant, followed by toluene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene.

Abstract: A mixture of hospital post-commercial polymer waste (LDPE/HDPE/PP/PS) was pyrolyzed over various catalysts using a fluidized-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons with zeolitic catalysts (ZSM-5>MOR>USY) were higher than with non-zeolitic catalysts (MCM-41>ASA). MCM-41 with large mesopores and ASA with weaker acid sites resulted in a highly olefinic product mixture with a wide carbon number distribution, whereas USY yielded a saturate–rich product mixture with a wide carbon number distribution and substantial coke levels. The systematic experiments discussed in this paper show that the use of various catalysts improves the yield of hydrocarbon products and provide better selectivity in the product distributions. A novel developed model based on kinetic and mechanistic considerations which take into account chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation for the catalytic degradation of commingled polymer waste has been investigated.

Abstract: The thermal treatment of the three-component mixtures of polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene has been investigated. Thermal reactions have been described and the kinetics of thermal decomposition using the Friedmańs differential isoconversional method have been evaluated; slow pyrolysis on a laboratory scale and the pyrolysis of a contaminated waste mixture on a commercial scale have been carried out. The obtained results show that polystyrene radicals promote the decomposition of polyolefins, as a result of which the thermal decomposition of polyethylene and polypropylene proceeds faster and the yields of the gas and oil obtained during pyrolysis are quite high: 4–6wt.% of gas and 88–90wt.% of oil in the case of laboratory-scale pyrolysis and 15wt.% of gas and losses and 80wt.% of oil in the case of commercial-scale pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TG-MS analyses have proved that the composition of volatile pyrolysis products varies. In the case of the ternary mixture with prevailing polyethylene (and polypropylene and polystyrene being in minority), the volatiles contained mainly aliphatic hydrocarbons and substituted benzenes; in the case of the ternary mixture with prevailing polypropylene, a significantly higher amount of substituted alicyclic compounds was found.

Abstract: Co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass is expected to replace traditional petroleum processing to produce BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) on a large scale, which are important chemical raw materials. The introduction of bimetallic catalysts and hydrogen in co-pyrolysis systems is an effective strategy to increase the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in pyrolysis oils, which has not been studied so far. The present study investigated the efficacy of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing aromatization and Diels-Alder reactions in comparison to Mo/ZSM-5. The synergistic interaction between bimetals contributed to the improved selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly BTEX. Results revealed that NiMo/ZSM-5 catalysts led to higher aromatics selectivity in liquid oil, whereas FeMo/ZSM-5 resulted in higher BTEX selectivity in aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, metal oxide-supported bimetallic catalysts exhibited lower selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid oil, despite facilitating higher liquid-oil yield. Among the metal oxide-supported bimetallic catalysts, FeMo/TiO2 demonstrated the highest selectivity (56%) for aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid oils. The introduction of hydrogen resulted in 100% selectivity of BTEX in aromatic hydrocarbons, thus highlighting the significance of hydrogenation in enhancing the selectivity of BTEX.

Abstract: Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass Vachellia Farnesiana (VF) and Polyropylene (PP) plastic was carried out using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) catalyst to produce high quality oil. A semi batch pyrolysis reactor was used to perform the co-pyrolysis of VF and PP at different temperatures (350–550 °C), time (20-60mins), VF/PP ratio (0–100 %) and catalyst loading (0–10 %).

The best conditions for the process were thus found to be 450 °C temperature, 40 min time, and 5 wt% Na2CO3 catalyst. Under these conditions, the maximum fuel oil yield of ∼ 64 % was achieved, which was approximately 4 % higher than oil yield obtained without utilization of Na2CO3 catalyst.

FTIR analysis was conducted to identify the functional groups present in the oil. Similarly, GCMS analysis further revealed that the presence of a significant alkanes and alkenes, along with fewer oxygenates, was responsible for the favorable GCV of the oil. The addition of the Na2CO3 catalyst was found to increase the concentrations of alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols, while reducing acids, ethers, and ketones.

Abstract: The conversion of low-value plastic waste into high-value products such as carbon nanomaterial is of recent interest. In the current study, the non-condensable pyrolysis gases, produced from Polypropylene Copolymer (PPC) feedstock, was converted into bamboo-type carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) through catalytic chemical vapour deposition using biochar. Experiments were conducted in a three-zone furnace fixed bed reactor, where PPC was pyrolysed in the second zone and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) growth was eventuated in the third zone. The effects of different growth temperatures (500, 700, 900 °C) and biochar particle sizes (nanoparticle as well as 0–100 and 100–300 μm) were investigated to optimise the production of hydrogen and the yield of carbon nanotubes on the biochar surface. Biochar samples used in the synthesis of CNTs were obtained from the pyrolysis of saw dust at 700 °C in a muffle furnace. Analyses performed by using Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy techniques suggested that the best crystalline structure of CNTs were obtained at 900 °C with nano-sized biochar as a catalyst. The strong gas-solid contact and void fraction of nano-sized particles enhances the diffusion–precipitation mechanism, leading to the growth of CNTs. The nano-sized biochar increased hydrogen production at 900 °C and reduced the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content in oil to only 1%, which is advantageous for further utilisation.

Abstract: This study focuses on the use of car tyre waste collected at a tyre repair station in Krakow (Poland). Waste from damaged tyres is disposed of as municipal solid waste. Therefore, the management of waste tyres already shredded by pyrolysis at 500 °C has been proposed. Tyre waste was hypothesised to be converted into valuable chemical products by pyrolysis in a hybrid reactor (drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor). On a micro scale, pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to analyse the pyrolysis process. It has been shown that the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during pyrolysis clearly depends on whether the catalyst and tyre waste are mixed together or arranged in layers. Since the layered arrangement favoured the formation of hydrocarbons, such a system was used in the drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor. The high heating rate (500 °C/s) of tyre particles in the drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C allowed for the obtained a raw carbon black yield of 40.8 %. A similar yield of raw carbon black determined by thermogravimetric analysis for a heating rate of 0.17 °C/s) was observed at 800 °C. However, before commercial use, raw carbon black requires demineralisation because of its high ash content (approximately 50 %). The raw carbon black ash contained up to 90 % SiO2, indicating that it could be a valuable catalyst material.

Abstract: Pyrolysis is a promising technology for converting plastic waste into valuable raw materials while offering a potential solution to the global plastic pollution crisis. In this study, the thermal pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is investigated in a drop tube reactor under nearly isothermal conditions. The impact of reaction temperature and gas/volatile residence time on carbon conversion and product distribution is examined across a range of 500–900 °C and 3.6–32.2 s, respectively. Non-condensable gas products detected by online mass spectrometry are H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8. At elevated temperatures and prolonged residence time, H2 yield reaches as high as 8.6 wt% of the initial HDPE mass due to intensified cracking reactions of C2–C3 hydrocarbons and long-chain aliphatic compounds. Consequently, pyrolysis tars consist mainly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 5–7 rings, accompanied by visible coke deposition within the reactor.

While processes for metal recovery from ELVs are well developed, the similar process for ASR remains a challenge. In this work, low-temperature pyrolysis of the ASR fraction was investigated under the assumption that a low temperature and inert environment would enhance the metal recovery, i.e. the metals would not be further oxidised from their original state and the organic material could be separated from the metals in the form of volatiles and char.

Abstract: The cracking of heavy wax derived from mixed plastics (high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene) to chemical and fuel purposes was explored using spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (spent FCC). The wax cracking was performed by a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor with a slow heating rate. All catalysts, when compared to other catalysts (HY zeolite and MCM-41), could enhance liquid oil and gas production. While the spent FCC catalyst produced the highest liquid oil with least amount of coke production. The influence of spent FCC catalyst ratio on product distribution revealed that a catalyst-wax ratio of up to 1:1 resulted in a higher liquid oil yield than a low ratio. Additionally, the increase of cracking temperature promoted more oil production; however, at high temperature (above 400 °C) the evaporation of wax became more significant, and consequently a high portion of produced wax was obtained. Therefore, under suitable conditions, the spent FCC catalyst demonstrated the possibility of upgrading the heavy wax into liquid fuels and chemicals. In addition, this study also compared the products obtained from two processing routes using the spent FCC catalyst. The first route involved the pyrolysis of plastics into wax and then cracking the wax into liquid fuel, while the second route involved a one-step process that directly converted plastics into liquid fuel.

The energy-related attributes of aluminum foil-laminated plastic residue have confirmed its potential as raw material for pyrolytic oil production, owing to its high energy content (31.76 MJ kg−1), volatile matter content (82.5 wt%), moderate ash content (17.5 wt%), negligible fixed carbon content (below 0.01 wt%), and predominant mass loss below 500 °C. The catalytic test results demonstrated that the concentration of alkanes increased by 2.5-fold and cyclic aliphatic compounds by 1.9-fold when utilizing the WO3/RHA catalyst compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. From the hydrocarbon distributions, success was achieved by the WO3/RHA catalyst in the cracking of heavy hydrocarbons (above C12) into valuable light hydrocarbons (C5–C12). The results permit us to conclude that utilizing the WO3/RHA catalyst enhances the yield of alkanes and cyclic aliphatic compounds within the C5–C12 range in the condensable volatile products, which are valuable gasoline-range hydrocarbons.

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2)-assisted thermal conversion of C-containing wastes can bring synergistic effect of CO2 reduction/consumption and valuable resources (e.g., syngas) recovery of from the wastes, and provide a solid option for the sustainable treatment. In this study, the effects of iron oxides on CO2-assisted pyrolysis of oxygen-free plastics (polyethylene, PE) for syngas generation were investigated.

Abstract: White pollution has intensified due to plastics’ inherent degradation resistance. Catalytic pyrolysis can convert waste plastics into valuable chemicals like light olefins and aromatics while reducing pollution. However, insufficient selectivity for target products remains a challenge. In this study, the shaped ZSM-5 (Z5) microspheres from industry was used and modified via 3.0 wt% impregnation of P, Ga, and Zn to enhance the yield of light olefins and aromatics in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Incorporating P, Ga, or Zn modulated catalyst acidity, promoting the dehydrogenation /aromatization reactions and significantly increasing liquid, light olefin and aromatic yields. The Zn-Z5 microspheres gave the highest light olefin yield (36.7 wt%), and decreased alkane yield by 24.6 wt%, sharply increasing olefin-alkane ratio from 0.52 to 1.56, compared with Z5. Concurrently, the yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and C9 + aromatics in the liquid products were increased, with the yield of aromatics rising from 22.6 wt% (Z5) to 38.4 wt% (Zn-P/Z5). Notably, the p-xylene (PX) selectivity in xylenes significantly improved, with the selectivity of Zn-P/Z5 attaining 75.3 %.

Abstract: This study put a great emphasis on the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in thermal decomposition of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). To do this, systematic experimental works were carried out to explore the influence of CO2 on pyrolysis of PVC by comparing with that in N2. First of all, a series of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of PVC in N2 and CO2 was performed to characterize the thermal deconstruction of PVC in N2 and CO2, which confirmed that any physical aspect (i.e., onset and end temperature of depolymerization of PVC) attributed by CO2 was nearly negligible as compared to the case in N2. This phenomenon was also fully evidenced by differential thermogram (DTG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) because both DTG and DSC curves in N2 and CO2 were identical. However, the concentration profiles of CO evolved from the thermal degradation of PVC in N2 and CO2 was significantly different: the enhanced generation of CO occurred in the presence of CO2. This observation suggested that the genuine role of CO2 is to consume carbon source (i.e., acting as a carbon scavenger) for pyrolysis of PVC. It also provided a favorable condition for suppressing the formation of harmful chemical compounds such as benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Therefore, the mass portion of the oil in pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of PVC in CO2 was lower than that in N2. These particular thermal degradation behaviors may be explained by the genuine role of CO2: the enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) evolved from the pyrolysis of PVC. The findings of this study strongly suggest that CO2 can be effectively applied to thermal disposal of recalcitrant wastes since employing CO2 in thermal treatment provides a means for in-situ mitigation and/or reduction of harmful chemical species.",YES,NO,"The study focuses on CO2's role in suppressing harmful byproducts during PVC pyrolysis, with no detailed oil composition or yield data reported beyond a qualitative statement about reduced oil yield.",NO_OIL_INFO;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: Industrial-scale application of end-of-life plastic pyrolysis still faces significant problems, such as a lack of detailed knowledge on degradation mechanisms, parameters affecting the degradation, and formation pathways of the primary pyrolysis products. Today, the degradation mechanisms based on radical chain scission are insufficiently understood to explain the pyrolysis chemistry from feedstock-to-product comprehensively. In this study, the impact of operating conditions on the degradation mechanism is evaluated by pyrolyzing end-of-life and virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a continuous pilot-scale unit at temperature and pressure ranges of 450–504 ºC and 0.1–2 bara. The pyrolysis products were analyzed based on the detailed product composition obtained using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). A simplified kinetic mechanism was proposed to describe the main production pathways of the various components by considering the weakest points along the polymer chain. The results showed that the chain-end scission mechanism is the main mechanism in the HDPE pyrolysis process, even at low temperatures and pressures in the studied ranges. The pyrolysis of virgin HDPE under sub-atmospheric pressure, 0.1 bara, at 464 ºC reactor temperature, yields the highest concentration of linear hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil (93.2 wt%). At higher pressure and temperature, the cyclic and branched hydrocarbons had a higher share of up to 17.4 wt% compared to 6.8 wt% at vacuum pressure and lower temperature. Interestingly, the pyrolysis of end-of-life HDPE at atmospheric pressure and 450 ºC led to more cyclic and branched hydrocarbons (sum: 22.1 wt%), as opposed to that of virgin HDPE which is more prone to the production of linear hydrocarbons at the studied conditions.

Abstract: Pyrolysis of polyolefins generates a large amount of olefins, which can serve as a valuable feedstock for the synthesis of chemicals. Nevertheless, their effective utilization requires refining owing to their diverse carbon distribution. This study performed a comprehensive GC×GC analysis of pyrolysis oils derived from waste polypropylene (PP) and waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The chemical composition of PP pyrolysis oil exhibited a high content of iso-olefins, whereas HDPE pyrolysis oil contained mainly alpha-olefins. Experimental batch distillation of PP pyrolysis oil yielded narrow hydrocarbon cuts with iso-olefins content exceeding 70 wt%. In contrast, distillation of HDPE resulted in cuts with more than 25 wt% alpha-olefins content. To perform ASPEN simulations, the physical properties (density, viscosity) of the oil were determined, two ways for obtaining boiling curves (ASTM D2887 and ASTM D86) were compared and two property methods (Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong) were compared.

Abstract: Achieving high selectivity towards valuable products is crucial for the industrial development of any technology.

In order to progress towards a highly efficient reactor for HPDE steam cracking, operation fine-tuning with this reactor has been addressed. This novel reactor technology enables a transition from conventional spouting regime to a fountain enhanced regime, as well as preventing the elutriation of fine particles. In order to progress in the understanding of the role played by process conditions in the HDPE steam cracking, a study has been conducted by analyzing the influence of bed particle size and steam flow rate on product distribution. Thus, two different particle sizes (0.35–0.50 mm and 0.63–0.80 mm) and a wide range of water flow rates (from 2.5 to 10 mL min−1) covering from conventional spouting to fountain enhanced regimes were explored. The detailed evaluation of the results revealed the combined effect of residence time, gas–solid contact and effective volume available in the fountain for steam cracking reactions.

Abstract: Cold plasma-assisted catalytic upcycling of polyolefin wastes integrated with CO2 into value-added chemicals is a promising solution for mitigating the global carbon emissions and fossil energy crisis, but still challenging due to the complexity of products and low energy efficiency. Given this, a novel one-stage process of cold plasma coupled with Ga-modified hierarchical H-ZSM-5 (Ga/Hie-ZSM-5) catalyst for polyolefins upgrading was designed with polyolefins followed by the catalysts within the plasma region, which facilitated the upcycling of polyolefins to light olefins and CO2 activation by plasma, and thereby the enhanced synergy between cold plasma and catalysts for aromatics production. At an input power of ca. 45 W without external heating, the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste was completely converted with the assistance of CO2 and the yield of oil products over the Ga/Hie-ZSM-5 catalyst was highly up to 62.2 wt%, with nearly 100% selectivity of aromatics. Meanwhile, the degradation efficiency of LDPE and the energy efficiency could reach 2.5 gLDPE⋅gcat −1⋅h−1 and 55.56 gLDPE⋅gcat −1⋅kW−1⋅h−1, respectively. Mechanism investigation revealed that the plasma and CO2 synergistically affect the primary cracking of LDPE, forming a primary product enriched in olefins and a small amount of CO. Subsequently, the produced olefins intermediates were further aromatized via cyclization-dehydrogenation route on the Ga/Hie-ZSM-5 catalyst with assistance of CO2 under the synergistic effect of plasma-catalysis.

Abstract: Catalytic conversion of useless chlorinated heavy wax (chlorine, 0.14 wt%) obtained from pyrolysis of refuse plastic fuel was studied using iron oxide impregnated HY zeolite to produce a useful liquid product. It was found that the largest liquid fraction (gasoline and kerosene/ diesel, 66.9 wt.%) with very low chlorine content was achieved when using Fe[3]/HY among impregnated HY catalysts. This demonstrated that the Fe impregnated HY catalyst had a dual function of catalytic cracking of HY zeolite and dechlorination of iron oxide. Excessive impregnation of Fe, i.e., Fe[20]/HY, showed the least cracking activity of heavy wax owing to the catalyst having lowest total acid sites, but yielded liquid product with the lowest chlorine content (60 ppm) among the tested catalysts.

Abstract: The pyrolysis of plastic waste to fuel will lead to greener waste management, ensure sustainability and serve as an alternative energy source. This study seeks to convert plastic waste into diesel engine-grade oil as an alternative energy source for various applications. A mixture of plastic waste of 58% PET, 20% HDPE, 12% LDPE, 7% PP, and 3% PS were used for the study. Catalytic and thermal pyrolysis was conducted in a batch reactor at a temperature of 450 °C for 2 h using Nitrogen gas. The plastic fuel produced was then analyzed using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). The various characteristics of the oil, such as the kinematic viscosity, calorific value, density, and pour point, were determined. The results indicated that thermal pyrolysis produced 13% liquid, 59% gas and 27% solid residue, and on the other hand, catalytic pyrolysis yielded 15.16% liquid, 69.16% of gas, and 14.8% of solid residue. The FT-IR also showed the presence of aliphatic and aromatic compounds with a predominance of the aliphatic group. From the GC–MS analysis, the plastic fuel contains 30 compounds in the C8- C40 range.

Abstract: The primary challenges in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste to produce light olefins lie in the selective conversion of larger olefins and diolefins downstream of the pyrolyzer. Hence, the catalytic cracking mechanism of plastic pyrolysis oil was explored using an α-olefin (1-decene) and a diolefin (1,9-decadiene) model compounds over an HZSM-5 zeolite-based catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor. Key objectives were to elucidate the reaction pathways for light olefin production, aromatization, and coke formation in catalytic cracking of larger olefins and diolefins. The investigation explored the impact of HZSM-5 steam treatment severity, contact time (∼58–226 ms), and reaction temperature (250–450 °C) on product yields. The severity of steam treatment was found to increase the 1-decene isomerization rate while decreasing the cracking rate and conversion of 1-decene to C3-4 light olefins. In the catalytic cracking of 1-decene, major product types included olefins (linear and nonlinear) and a few naphthenes, while in the case of 1,9-decadiene catalytic cracking, non-linear olefins were absent, with abundant naphthenes followed by lighter diolefins and C3-5 linear olefins. Temperature and contact time variations revealed that the catalytic cracking of 1-decene initiated with double bond rearrangement isomerization, progressing to skeletal isomerization, and intensified cracking reactions producing light C3-4 olefins. Conversely, in the catalytic cracking of 1,9-decadiene, cyclization was the primary reaction pathway, followed by β-scission, resulting in lighter conjugated dienes and light linear olefins. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of spent catalysts confirmed a higher coke amount generated during 1,9-decadiene cracking compared to 1-decene cracking, indicating that diene compounds serve as precursors for significant coke formation in plastic pyrolysis oil.

Abstract: The coexistence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyolefins in plastic waste poses a significant challenge for pyrolysis-based recycling, as PET decomposition generates oxygenates that reduce product quality. To address this, we developed a two-stage reactor system that catalytically upgrades vapors from PET–LDPE mixtures using Ga- and Zn-impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts. XPS analysis revealed that impregnation with Ga and Zn leads to the formation of GaOx and ZnOH+ species, which introduce new Lewis acid sites. When these sites are located near Brønsted acid sites, synergistic interactions enhance both deoxygenation and aromatization, improving the catalytic performance of HZSM-5. At 600 °C, PET pyrolysis produces significant amounts of CO2, CO, and benzoic acid, resulting in oxygen-rich pyrolysis oil. While unmodified HZSM-5 achieves full deoxygenation, the resulting PyOil yield is modest, ranging from 24 to 34 wt%. In contrast, Ga- and Zn-modified catalysts increase PyOil yield to ∼50 wt% and improve mono-aromatic (BTX) selectivity to 80–89 % by shifting the acid site distribution toward weaker acidity, thereby favoring decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and aromatization. Notably, Zn-HZSM-5 maintained high BTX selectivity even with increasing PET content, outperforming Ga-HZSM-5, which exhibited higher polyaromatic hydrocarbon formation under similar conditions.

The catalytic performances of the zeolite powders, their derived alumina extrudates, and physical mixtures of zeolites/γ-Al2O3 are evaluated in polypropylene catalytic cracking. A detailed thermogravimetric and spectroscopic (operando FT-IR-GC-MS) analysis of the reaction, including catalyst coking and regeneration, shows the emergence of rules to design fit-for-purpose catalysts. IR spectroscopy-derived number, nature, and strength of the acid sites are consistent with the catalytic results, highlighting the role of new catalytic sites located on the external or mesoporous surfaces of the zeolites, i.e., at the zeolite-binder interface. This illustrates that binding and subsequent thermal treatment of zeolite powders to produce industrially relevant catalysts determine the quality and quantity of active sites not always present in pure powders, typically reported in the open literature.

The CB from both feedstocks had low contents of ash (<0.03%), volatiles (∼0.5%), sulphur (<0.7%), and high carbon (≥95%). The BET surface area and average primary particle size for CB from STPO and HRF were comparable to those of commercial CBs from fossil fuel feedstock. The CB from HRF had a higher carboxyl oxygen functional group (18%) compared to the CB from STPO (∼13%) and commercial CB (<5%).",YES,NO,"The study focuses on carbon black production from pyrolysis oil, not on characterizing the oil composition or its use as a fingerprint for plastic feedstock.",TARGET_CNT;OIL_NOT_MAIN_PRODUCT

Abstract: High-efficiency particulate air filters are widely used for indoor air purification. Spent filter waste (SFW), which can trap infectious and toxic substances, is primarily treated via incineration. This method causes environmental concerns, particularly regarding the generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants. To cope with these issues, this work proposes the pyrolysis of SFW using CO2 as a sustainable alternative to conventional incineration. The introduction of CO2 enhanced reactivity during pyrolysis, potentially offering a more sustainable process. The SFW consisted of filtered particles and two distinct filter/support layers, and the presence of toxic chemicals and primary polymer constituents was characterized. While CO2 had a minimal impact on enhancing syngas production, owing to its slow reaction rate during SFW pyrolysis, adding a nickel-based catalyst significantly improved CO2 reactivity. This resulted in a 649.7% increase in carbon monoxide (CO) production compared to that in pyrolysis under N2. The potential of this pyrolysis system for reducing CO2 emissions was evaluated against that of conventional incineration. Overall, this study presents a promising method for the pyrolytic conversion of SFW into combustible gases, particularly CO, while leveraging CO2 utilisation to mitigate global warming.",NO,NO,The study focuses on syngas production from spent filter waste with no mention of liquid/oil product composition or yield data.,NO_EXTRACTABLE_DATA;TARGET_HYDROGEN;NO_OIL_INFO
S259012302503823X__META_ABS.xml,"Title: Effect of acid catalysts on yield and selectivity of plastics waste pyrolysis from municipal solid waste in Samui Island, Thailand
Abstract: Due to concerns about plastic waste affecting solid waste management, pyrolysis has emerged as an intriguing technology that enhances sustainability potential by reducing harmful plastic waste in ecosystems and natural resource usage as well as generating profits from its products as an alternative fuel for engines. In this study, Samui Island plastic waste was used as feedstock for pyrolysis. The process was carried out at different temperatures (425 °C, 450 °C, and 475 °C), different amounts of catalyst loading (0, 1, 3, 5 wt.%), and different types of catalysts (HY zeolite, NaY zeolite, spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and Fe/Al2O3). The results showed that the pyrolysis at 450 °C with 3 wt.% of spent FCC catalyst provided the highest amount of liquid product. In addition, the pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) produced the most liquid product (91.44 wt.%), while the liquid products from the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) exhibited the highest percentage of diesel (36.60 wt.%). After improving product yield from a mixture of PE/polypropylene (PP)/PS (80:15:5), a representative sample of plastic waste from Samui Island, the results demonstrated that the pyro-diesel was comparable to commercial diesel, with a low operating cost (0.33 USD/L) and improved pyrolysis oil quality (0.65 USD/L).",YES,YES,"Polystyrene and polyethylene/propylene mix pyrolysis with detailed liquid product yields and diesel fraction data, enabling oil fingerprinting.",HAS_OIL_YIELD_DATA;HAS_OIL_COMPOSITION;DEFINED_PLASTIC_MIX;GENERAL_CATALYST
