You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Polymers or copolymers
   - Plastic-containing composites

   Acceptable terms include:
   - pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
     waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   → If pyrolysis is conducted on NON-plastic feedstocks (methane, light hydrocarbons, coal, biomass, bio-oil components, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, algae, fuels, sugars, furans)—even if pyrolysis is performed—return **NO**.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include **real laboratory experiments**, such as:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave pyrolysis reactor
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - temperature-controlled reactor tests
   - heating experiments (e.g., 400–900°C)
   - measured product yields (oil, wax, gas, char)
   - product analysis using GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.

   → If the study is purely computational, theoretical, simulation-based, DFT-only,
     modeling-only, ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return **NO**.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results, such as:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance comparisons
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor operating conditions
   - energy analysis from real experiments
   - fuel engine test results

   → If experimental data is not clearly present or is ambiguous → return **NO**.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON with fields:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one sentence explaining why>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing, unclear, or ambiguous criterion → "NO".
- The reason MUST be **one and only one sentence**.
- The reason must reflect the MAIN decisive failure factor
  (e.g., “not plastic feedstock”, “no lab experiment”, “no measurable data”).
- Do NOT include extra text outside JSON.

<<ABSTRACT>>


Factors affecting the yield of carbon of different types obtained by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons Pyrolysis of methane at 1100°C and 1 see contact time in a static-bed flow reactor packed with granules of high-temperature coke resulted in the formation of dense pyrolytic carbon, firmly attached to the coke surface and reactor wall, together with fine dispersed carbon which could be separated by screening. As the surface area of the coke diminished during a run the formation of surface carbon generally decreased while the yield of the fine carbon increased. Among other factors the temperature of pyrolysis (between 900–1200°C), homogeneous catalysis (by iodine and HBr)and the effect of raw material composition (hydrocarbons with mol. wt. between 16 and 316) have been investigated. The surface carbon obtained from methane was very pure (ash content 0·35 per cent) with a high density (2·1 g/cm3) and showed high resistance to oxidation with nitric acid.
