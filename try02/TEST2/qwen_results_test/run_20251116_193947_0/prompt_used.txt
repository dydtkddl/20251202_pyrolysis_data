You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Polymers or copolymers
   - Plastic-containing composites

   Acceptable terms include:
   - pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
     waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   → If pyrolysis is conducted on NON-plastic feedstocks (methane, light hydrocarbons, coal, biomass, bio-oil components, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, algae, fuels, sugars, furans)—even if pyrolysis is performed—return **NO**.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include **real laboratory experiments**, such as:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave pyrolysis reactor
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - temperature-controlled reactor tests
   - heating experiments (e.g., 400–900°C)
   - measured product yields (oil, wax, gas, char)
   - product analysis using GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.

   → If the study is purely computational, theoretical, simulation-based, DFT-only,
     modeling-only, ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return **NO**.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results, such as:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance comparisons
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor operating conditions
   - energy analysis from real experiments
   - fuel engine test results

   → If experimental data is not clearly present or is ambiguous → return **NO**.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON with fields:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one sentence explaining why>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing, unclear, or ambiguous criterion → "NO".
- The reason MUST be **one and only one sentence**.
- The reason must reflect the MAIN decisive failure factor
  (e.g., “not plastic feedstock”, “no lab experiment”, “no measurable data”).
- Do NOT include extra text outside JSON.

<<ABSTRACT>>


Hydrothermal formation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol from 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde and d-fructose Thermolysis of 0.05 M aqueous 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) at 27.5 MPa and 290 to 400°C led to the formation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol in yields of up to 46% at 50% HMF conversion. The reaction temperature and water density have a significant effect on the product composition. Pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for HMF conversion under these conditions range from 0.107 to 0.308 min−1. For the region 290 to 350°C, the activation energy for HMF conversion was found to be 47.7 kJ.mol−1. When subjecting d-fructose to hydrothermolysis, the main products are HMF, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, and furfural.
