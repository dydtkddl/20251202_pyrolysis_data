You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis**  
   - Thermal or catalytic decomposition  
   - Pyrolysis reactor / heating system / temperature range (e.g., 400–800 °C)  
   - Keywords: pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization, waste-to-fuel, plastic-to-oil, etc.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**  
   The study must involve **physical experiments** at laboratory scale, such as:  
   - Bench-scale pyrolysis reactor  
   - Lab-scale fixed-bed reactor / batch reactor / fluidized bed / microwave reactor  
   - Catalyst tests with actual reactors  
   - Real measured outputs (liquid/oil/wax yields, gas composition, char yield, etc.)  
   - Hands-on characterization (GC-MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.)

   → If the study is purely computational, simulation-based, theoretical, review, modeling-only, LCA-only, ML-only, or process optimization without experiments → **Return NO**

3. **The study should contain or enable actual experimental data extraction**  
   - Yield values  
   - Catalyst performance comparisons  
   - Product distributions  
   - Temperature–yield relationships  
   - Measured chemical composition  
   - Engine test results from produced fuel  
   - Any quantitative experimental dataset

   → If the abstract does not clearly indicate measurable experimental data, return **NO**.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON with fields:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one sentence explaining why>"
}

Rules:
- If ANY of the three criteria is missing or ambiguous → return "NO".
- The reason must be only one sentence.
- NO extra text outside JSON.
- Reason must reflect the key decisive factor (e.g., “no real experiments”, “not about pyrolysis”, “modeling only”).

Molecular simulations based on reactive force-fields (ReaxFF) have been applied as a powerful tool for exploring the pyrolysis process of complex carbonaceous materials. It can describe the breakage and formation of bonds during the chemical reaction processes based on Bond-Order so as to explore the complex reaction mechanisms from microscale, which can offset experimental flaws. In this review, we attempt to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art advances in the pyrolysis process of coal, biomass, polymer and fuel at molecular level. First the major constituent elements, development, force field optimization, diverse application of ReaxFF MD is introduced. Then, the kinetics models, pyrolysis mechanisms and products reaction pathways of coal, biomass, polymer and fuel are discussed. In addition, the train and optimization of force field and post-processing of simulation are discussed, which can improve reaction analysis capability and provide new ideas to extract information. We conclude the pyrolysis application using ReaxFF MD from microscopic level with an eye toward the future challenges and developments in those fields.
