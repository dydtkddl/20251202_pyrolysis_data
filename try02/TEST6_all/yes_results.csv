"Monomer production from supercritical ethanol depolymerization of PET plastic waste using Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst Plastic waste poses a serious threat to the global environment, with recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic accounting for a considerable portion. The application of supercritical ethanol depolymerization technology presents an effective method for recycling PET waste. This study investigated using Ni as an additive to enhance the catalytic activity of ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for PET waste depolymerization. The effects of different catalysts, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and reaction time on PET waste depolymerization were studied using the single-factor controlled variable method. The results showed that the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 was the optimal catalyst, and under the optimal conditions with catalyst dosage of 4 %, reaction temperature of 260 °C, and reaction time of 60 min, the depolymerization efficiency of PET waste could reach 100 %, with the highest yields of diethyl terephthalate (DET) and ethylene glycol (EG) of 93.6 % and 90.2 %, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the operating conditions to obtain the highest monomer yields. The predicted optimal parameters from RSM were as follows: reaction temperature = 262.8 °C, reaction time = 63.2 min, catalyst dosage = 3.8 wt%, with the predicted highest DET and EG yields of 95.9 % and 90.7 %, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for DET and EG possessed the R2 values of 0.9921 and 0.9885, respectively, with p-values < 0.0001, indicating a good fit for the models. Furthermore, after five times reuse, the 3Ni-ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst still exhibited good catalytic activity and stability. In conclusion, this study offers a clean, green, and sustainable alternative to recycling plastic waste.","The study involves catalytic depolymerization of PET plastic waste, a form of plastic pyrolysis, with measurable yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization."
"Conversion of low density polyethylene into fuel through co-processing with vacuum gas oil in a fluid catalytic cracking riser reactor In this work, mixtures of vacuum gas oil and low density polyethylene, a major component of common industrial and consumer household plastics, were pyrolytically co-processed in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) riser reactor as a viable alternative for the energy and petrochemical revalorisation of plastic wastes into valuable petrochemical feedstocks and fuel within an existing industrial technology. Using equilibrium FCC catalyst, the oil–polymer blends were catalytically cracked at different processing conditions of temperatures between 773K and 973K and catalyst feed ratios of 5:1, 7:1 and 10:1. The influence of each of these processing parameters on the cracking gas and liquid yield patterns were studied and presented. Further analysed and presented are the different compositional distributions of the obtained liquids and gaseous products. The analysis of the results obtained revealed that with very little modifications to existing process superstructure, yields and compositional distributions of products from the fluid catalytic cracking of the oil–polymer blend in many cases were very similar to those of the processed oil feedstock, bringing to manifest the viability of the feedstock co-processing without significant detriments to FCC product yields and quality.",The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of low density polyethylene in a fluid catalytic cracking riser reactor with measurable product yields and compositional analysis under varying temperature and catalyst ratios.
"Co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and polypropylene: A route to improved biofuel from mixed waste streams This study explores the use of thermochemical co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and waste cooking oil as a sustainable pathway for converting plastic and lipid-based residues into liquid biofuels. Comprehensive characterisation is performed using thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess decomposition behaviour, product yields, and chemical composition across varying feedstock blend ratios. The addition of waste cooking oil is found to significantly reduce the initial decomposition temperature from 396 °C (pure waste polypropylene) to 315 °C, and to enhance the liquid yield, reaching a maximum of 70.00 % at a 1:1 blend ratio of the two feedstocks. Chemical analysis reveals a progressive increase in oxygenated functional groups and a shift toward longer-chain hydrocarbon compounds (C13–C18) with an increase in the content of waste cooking oil, features associated with improved combustion potential and fuel quality. Particulate matter analysis reveals notable variations in particle size distribution and concentration, with waste polypropylene alone generating predominantly ultrafine particles in the 3–30 nm range. In contrast, higher proportions of waste cooking oil and increased thermal load are found to shift the particle sizes toward the 20–40 nm range. These results indicate that the co-pyrolysis of plastic and cooking oil waste not only enables efficient waste valorisation but also produces bio-based liquid fuels with favourable chemical and emission-related properties. The findings support the development of integrated waste-to-energy strategies that are aligned with the concept of the circular economy and sustainable bioenergy goals.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and waste cooking oil, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed chemical characterization using GC–MS and other analytical techniques."
"Pyrolysis behavior of different type of materials contained in the rejects of packaging waste sorting plants In this paper rejected streams coming from a waste packaging material recovery facility have been characterized and separated into families of products of similar nature in order to determine the influence of different types of ingredients in the products obtained in the pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis experiments have been carried out in a non-stirred batch 3.5dm3 reactor, swept with 1Lmin−1 N2, at 500°C for 30min. Pyrolysis liquids are composed of an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The aqueous phase is greater as higher is the cellulosic material content in the sample. The organic phase contains valuable chemicals as styrene, ethylbenzene and toluene, and has high heating value (HHV) (33–40MJkg−1). Therefore they could be used as alternative fuels for heat and power generation and as a source of valuable chemicals. Pyrolysis gases are mainly composed of hydrocarbons but contain high amounts of CO and CO2; their HHV is in the range of 18–46MJkg−1. The amount of COCO2 increases, and consequently HHV decreases as higher is the cellulosic content of the waste. Pyrolysis solids are mainly composed of inorganics and char formed in the process. The cellulosic materials lower the quality of the pyrolysis liquids and gases, and increase the production of char.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste packaging plastics in a batch reactor with measured product yields, composition analysis, and fuel properties, satisfying all required criteria."
"Catalytic cracking of polyethylene over nanocrystalline HZSM-5: Catalyst deactivation and regeneration study In this work, catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) over nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite in a batch reactor at 340°C was carried out with the aim of study both the catalyst resistance to deactivation and the catalyst regeneration process. For looking into the catalyst deactivation, consecutive polyethylene cracking experiments were carried out. Subsequently, the same reactions has been also performed but by regenerating the zeolite after each experiment by promoting coke combustion at 550°C under air flow. Zeolites used were two samples of nanocrystalline HZSM-5 with very different textural properties (sample A, with most of its surface corresponding to zeolitic micropores and sample B with a considerable amount of external surface, mesopores and super-micropores) in order to study the effect of their textural properties in the deactivation and regeneration experiments. Although conversion and activity values reached over both samples are quite high taking into account the mild conditions used, sample B shows a very much higher initial activity than A due to its improved textural properties. In both samples two different deactivation mechanisms occur: a reversible deactivation by coke deposition removable by the regeneration procedure, and an irreversible or permanent deactivation by other factors. Deactivation of sample B occurs faster due to the higher amount of coke deposited on this material. However, the improved textural properties of this catalyst supposes an advantage for the regeneration process, since coke deposited either on the external surface or on the super-micropores and mesopores, makes easier the regeneration procedure.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE) in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature conditions, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of deactivation and regeneration processes."
"Chemical catalysed recycling of waste polymers: Catalytic conversion of polypropylene into fuels and chemicals over spent FCC catalyst in a fluidised-bed reactor Polypropylene (PP) was pyrolysed over spent FCC commercial catalyst (FCC-s1) using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The influence of reaction conditions including catalyst, temperature, and ratio of polymer to catalyst feed and flow rates of fluidising gas was examined. The yield of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon products at 390°C for spent FCC commercial catalyst (87.8wt%) gave much higher yield than silicate (only 17.1wt%). Greater product selectivity was observed with FCC-s1 as a post-use catalyst with about 61wt% olefins products in the C3–C7 range. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reaction conditions. Valuable hydrocarbons of olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times used in this study. It is also demonstrated that a post-use catalyst system under appropriate conditions the resource potential of polymer waste can be economically recovered and also can address the recycling desire to see an alternative to solve a major environment problem.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized-bed pyrolysis of waste polypropylene using a commercial catalyst, with measurable yields, product composition, and reaction condition effects reported."
"Feasibility study on co-processing of automobile shredder residue in coal-fired power plants via pyrolysis Facing the challenges of organic industrial solid waste (OISW) disposal, co-processing of OISW by power plants has become a developing trend. In order to avoid feeding problems of OISW and enhance the combustion adaptability of the furnace, pyrolysis coupled with incineration technology is proposed as a potential method. Among various OISW, automobile shredder residue (ASR) is regarded as a promising fuel due to its high heating value. In view of engineering application, the researches focused on the products’ properties and economic evaluation under a wide range of heating rates which are insufficient. In this study, regarding the rapid pyrolysis by conducting the high-temperature flue gas as heating source in power plants, the pyrolysis behavior of ASR was correspondingly studied under a wide range of heating rates. The formation of volatiles and property’s improvement were further investigated for generating high-valued oil. Results showed that the high heating rate is not only beneficial to the homogenization of pyrolytic products but also the aromatization in oil and radical generation in gases. Importantly, it also contributed to the cleavage of the single bond connected to the benzene ring and carbon-oxygen single bond for esters. By conducting the enhanced cracking of volatiles, the wax-like fraction was significantly reduced. In addition, the deoxygenation in oil (oxygen content decreased by 20 wt%) and high heating value of gases (increased by 73%) were improved. Our findings demonstrated the feasibility and economic efficiency for the co-processing of ASR in coal-fired power plants via pyrolysis and thus provide guidance for future commercial application.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue, a waste plastic mixture, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis, and reactor condition data."
"Kinetics of scrap tyre pyrolysis under fast heating conditions The kinetics of scrap tyre pyrolysis has been studied by means of thermogravimetry (runs at constant temperature and following temperature ramps) and using a fast heating microreactor. The advantages of the microreactor for obtaining kinetic data at higher temperatures (in the 773–973K range) than those corresponding to thermogravimetry and under conditions similar to those of continuous large-scale reactor are clearly shown. The validity of the kinetic parameters determined (E =98.6kJmol−1 and k 0 =7.35×104 s−1) will only be restricted by unavoidable heat and mass transfer limitations, which have been minimized by using a particle size smaller than 0.2mm. The kinetic results are evidence, on the one hand, of the limitations of these laboratory techniques for the kinetic study and, on the other, of the inherent heat and mass limitations of this material. Through monitoring by gas chromatography, the kinetics of formation of hydrocarbon products has been determined. These products are interesting as raw materials for petrochemistrical industry (mainly light olefins and aromatics) and for the synthesis of basic materials in tyre manufacturing (isoprene and 1,3-butadiene).","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of scrap tyres using thermogravimetry and a fast heating microreactor, with measurable product yields and kinetic data derived from gas chromatography analysis."
"From plastics to methane and carbon spheres: The evolution of pyrolysis products during pyrolysis under autogenic atmosphere Pyrolysis of plastics is a promising technique towards high-value utilization and solvent-free treatment of plastic waste. However, low product selectivity and broad product distribution may restrict the application of plastic pyrolysis. In this study, polyolefins and polystyrene (PS) were converted into methane and carbon spheres through pyrolysis under autogenic atmosphere (AAP). To elucidate the product evolution and reaction mechanism of AAP, product distributions, compositions and properties at 450–700 °C were investigated. At 450 °C, polyolefins were converted into 89.3–96.91 wt% pyrolysis oil; PS was converted into 88.4 wt% of pyrolysis oil, 2.3 wt% of gas and 9.3 wt% of char. As the increase of temperature, the yields of methane and pyrolysis char increased significantly. At 700 °C, the yields of pyrolysis chars were as high as ~45 wt% and 74.1 wt% for polyolefins and PS, respectively, and the rest products was mainly pyrolysis gas with less than 1 wt% of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis chars were well carbonized spheres with diameters of 2 − 8 µm. Pyrolysis gas contained 93.83–95.74 vol% of methane, and possessed higher heating values of 35.8–36.2 MJ m−3. The pyrolysis products with high purity and narrow distribution can be attributed to the enhancement of AAP on the secondary reactions of primary decomposition products, such as cracking, hydrogenation, aromatization and condensation.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyolefins and polystyrene (plastic waste) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent product distributions, and detailed characterization of pyrolysis oil, gas, char, and their properties."
"Value-added products from pyrolysis of hydrochar derived from polyvinyl chloride and alkali coal This work targets to produce multi value-added products by pyrolysis of hydrochars obtained from co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) of PVC and alkali coal. The hydrochars pyrolysis was carried out with a downdraft fixed bed reactor. The results indicate that HTC promoted the damage of oxygen functional groups, and the fixed carbon content and calorific value were considerably improved after co-HTC. The entire pyrolysis was delayed for coal hydrochar due to the increase of stable compositions in coal structure and improvement of coal rank. Besides, the PVC addition weakened this delay because of its instability, which could be verified by the activation energy. The H2 and CH4 yields increased in syngas, while the CO2 yield was concurrently reduced because of the removal of oxygen by decarboxylation. The obtained H2/CO ratio of syngas from hydrochar pyrolysis ranged from 1.34 to 4.33 depending on the pyrolysis parameters. The tar yield from hydrochar pyrolysis was lower than that of raw coal, which was ascribed to the lower degree of crosslinking in hydrochar facilitating the release of tar. The aromatic degree and rich pore structures of char indicated its great potential for contaminants adsorption which was further confirmed by the malachite green adsorption experiments. These findings could provide comprehensive knowledge on producing multi value-added products (hydrogen-rich syngas, poly-aromatic tar and adsorbent-char) from hydrochar pyrolysis, which would promote the economical utilization of high alkali coal and chlorinated wastes.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of hydrochar derived from polyvinyl chloride (a waste plastic) and alkali coal using a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, syngas composition, tar yield, and char characterization."
"Catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste over NiO and HY for gasoline-range hydrocarbons production Recovering fuels or chemicals from plastic waste via pyrolysis is an innovative and promising route for both energy saving and refuse elimination. In this study, catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was performed to simultaneously improve yield and quality of gasoline-range products. NiO and HY zeolite were respectively used as in-situ and ex-situ catalysts in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalysis system. The results showed that the optimum pyrolysis and catalysis temperatures were 500 °C and 450 °C, respectively, with 56.53 wt% oil product and 93.80% gasoline-range fraction achieved. The content of high-octane-number compounds, primarily aromatics and isomerized aliphatics, increased from 23.5% to 80.4% as HY to LDPE ratio rose from 0 to 1:5. The optimized balance between oil yield and oil quality was obtained at the HY to LDPE ratio of 1:10. The presence of NiO during co-catalysis slightly decreased the oil yield by 5.3–8.5 wt%. Meanwhile, the production of aromatics was promoted obviously while the yield of normal aliphatics was inhibited, which were both favorable to improve the octane number of the oil product. The improved performance of co-catalysis could be related to the suitable hydrogen abstraction ability of NiO, which produced enormous alkenes. Subsequently, cycloalkenes and aromatics were synthesized through Diels-Alder reactions over the catalysis of HY. This co-catalysis approach in the microwave reactor provides a potentially profitable way to convert plastic waste into high-quality and high-yield gasoline fuels.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of LDPE plastic waste with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions, demonstrating experimental data on oil yield and gasoline-range fraction."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE over H-beta and HZSM-5 zeolites in dynamic conditions Study of the evolution of the process The effect of the addition of a nanocrystalline H-beta zeolite in the pyrolysis of a commercial LDPE has been studied using dynamic conditions in a thermobalance and in a batch reactor, the results have been compared with those obtained using a HZSM-5 zeolite. The H-beta catalyst has an important influence on the decomposition of the polymer even at very low zeolite concentration. Although this mixture has a saturating effect at a certain concentration of catalyst (around 7%), a remarkable effect in the first steps of LDPE decomposition as increasing the catalyst loading has been observed. This important catalytic effect has been attributed to the external acid sites present in the H-beta zeolite. The study of the gaseous products evolved in the catalytic pyrolysis shows the influence of the structure and the temperature on the composition of the gas, and a possible effect of the deactivation of the catalyst. The isobutane/n-butane ratio obtained showed an important variation with temperature and was higher in the gas produced using H-beta than with HZSM-5. This different behaviour can be explained by the different pore structure. A preliminary study of the coke formed with the H-beta zeolite has been carried out and the results show that the zeolite causes an important delay in the oxidation process.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of commercial LDPE using H-beta and HZSM-5 zeolites, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis characteristics of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) under isothermal conditions The pyrolysis characteristics of GFRP (glass fiber reinforced plastic) were determined under isothermal conditions at 500–1000°C using a thermo-balance reactor (TBR) and wire mesh reactor (WMR). The kinetics parameters for the GFRP were derived using the activation energy, of 28.17kJmol−1, of frequency factor, 2.12s−1, and reaction order, of 0.48–0.8. The structural variations in the GFRP char were determined using BET, SEM, and FT-IR techniques. Organic compounds and polymers were decomposed with increasing temperature. The experimental results showed that increasing the temperature and reaction time favored polymer scission at temperature of 600–1000°C with residence time of 2–10s.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst-free reactor conditions, and analytical characterization using TGA, BET, SEM, and FT-IR."
"Metal-loaded biochar catalyzed pyrolysis of wood-plastic composite waste into gasoline and aromatic hydrocarbons A serial of biochar supported Fe catalysts (c-Fe5/L, c-Fe10/L, c-Fe20/L and c-Fe30/L) were prepared and applied to catalytic pyrolysis of wood-polyethylene composites (WPE). H-ZSM-5 and c-Fe were used as comparative catalysts. Under the influence of c-Fe20/L, pyrolysis products of WPE mainly include C5-C12 aliphatic hydrocarbons (35.4 %), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs, 50.5 %) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, 11.2 %). C-Fe20/L exhibits excellent deoxygenation ability and gives the highest MAHs selectivity. This is related to the well-dispersed Fe0 species with high activity, uniform mesoporous pore size (2.17 nm), high specific surface area (453.58 m2/g), and high acid amount (14.55 mmolNH3/g) of c-Fe20/L. In addition, the effects of different pyrolysis conditions (catalyst dosage and pyrolysis temperature) on the distribution of WPE pyrolysis products were explored. The c-Fe20/L reusability was also studied. The c-Fe20/L still maintains high deoxygenation ability after three repeated uses.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic (polyethylene in wood-plastic composite) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization."
"Thermochemical degradation of agricultural mulch films for potential organic fertilizer precursors: Low-temperature pyrolysis in nitric acid Polyethylene mulch films (PEMFs) are widely used in agriculture to boost crop yields but pose significant environmental challenges due to their non-degradable nature. This study investigated the pyrolysis of PEMFs in nitric acid (HNO3) using micro-glass reactors under mild conditions for the production of thermochemical degradation products (TDP) as potential organic fertilizer precursors. The effects of HNO3 concentration (10–60 %), HNO3:PEMF ratio (0.5–2), pyrolysis temperature (150–250 °C), and reaction time (1 – 45 min) on the yield of TDP, tetrahydrofuran-soluble fraction (THF-S), tetrahydrofuran-insoluble fraction (THF-IS), and HNO3 consumption were studied. SEM, elemental analysis, GPC, and FTIR were employed to assess product characteristics and degradability potential. Optimal conditions were HNO3 concentration of 36 %, HNO3:PEMF ratio of 0.5, pyrolysis temperature of 200 °C, and reaction time of 10 min. Higher temperatures or longer time would lead to TDP condensation to carbonaceous residues. The introduction of N and O-containing functional groups in TDP suggested its potential as an organic soil fertilizer. This study presents a novel, eco-friendly, and cost-effective solution to address the waste PEMF disposal problem.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyethylene mulch films with measurable yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) production from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: The influence of catalyst and reaction pressure The production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by catalytic pyrolysis of plastics is an environmentally friendly and promising method of waste treatment and energy/materials production. Three types of metal catalysts (Fe/cordierite, Ni/cordierite and Ni-Mg/cordierite) were utilized during the catalytic pyrolysis process of polypropylene in this work. Meanwhile, the influence of reaction pressure (0.5–1.25 MPa) on the synthesis of CNTs was investigated. Carbon formation, especially CNTs, through catalytic pyrolysis of plastics has been tested in a fixed bed reactor, and the materials have been analyzed by temperature program oxidation (TPO), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The highest yield around 93 wt.% filamentous carbon was obtained using the Ni-based catalyst. The strong metal-support interaction within the Ni-Mg-based catalyst suppressed CNTs growth and resulted in shorter and irregular cylindrical carbon tubes. The yield of more uniform and thick CNTs increased with the additional of appropriate reaction pressure, especially at 1.0 MPa (198 mg/gPP). However, an excessive reaction pressure weakened CNTs growth and produced shorter length and larger diameters (around 30–50 nm) CNTs. The fraction of CNTs decreased when the reaction pressure was higher than 0.5 MPa.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene waste plastic in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product characterization, satisfying all mandatory criteria."
"Thermal degradation of polyethylene mixed with poly(vinyl chloride) and poly(ethyleneterephthalate) Thermal degradation of plastics such as polyethylene (PE), poly(vinylchloride) (PVC), poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) and their mixtures (PE + PVC and PE + PET) was studied at 430 °C by batch operation to analyse the conversion of waste plastics into fuel oil. A visual inspection of the inside of the reactor was made and the macroscopic process of degradation was monitored. Products of degradation were classified into three groups: gases, liquids and residues in the reactor. The degradation of PE produced liquid products which consisted of C5-C25 fraction of hydrocarbons with a yield of 70 wt%. On the other hand, the degradation of PVC produced only 4.7 wt% liquid products which consisted of C5-C20 fraction of hydrocarbons and the degradation of PET produced no liquid products. The effect of mixing PVC and PET with PE on the yield and compositions of liquid products was investigated. The addition of either PVC or PET to PE decreased the overall liquid products yield; however, it promoted the degradation of PE into low molecular weight liquid hydrocarbon products.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PVC, PET) with measurable product yields, temperature conditions, and product composition analysis."
"Experimental investigation on slow thermal pyrolysis of real-world plastic wastes in a fixed bed reactor to obtain aromatic rich fuel grade liquid oil Plastic wastes have become one of the biggest global environmental issues and thus recycling such massive quantities is targeted. Thermal pyrolysis has been the most suitable approach to convert the waste plastic into a source of energy. This study aims to compare the thermal pyrolysis of waste plastic with that of the modal plastic compounds in a fixed bed reactor. The liquid oil, obtained from the thermal pyrolysis of HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS wastes were characterized using FT-IR, GC-MS and 1H NMR. Also, their fuel properties such as viscosity and calorific values were characterized using parallel plate rheometer and bomb calorimeter respectively. C10–C44 paraffins and C10–C22 olefins were obtained along with aromatics and alcohols in different type of plastic waste pyrolysis oil. The viscosity of the plastic oil is within kerosene and diesel range. The calorific values of the oils are at par with the Petro fuels.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of real-world plastic wastes (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS) with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and analytical characterization of oil composition."
"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation during the fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste Health-care waste management is a challenge for the health sector. Currently, pyrolysis technologies are being used to treat medical waste that can convert it to a hydrocarbon fuel. In the present study, hazardous health-care waste was pyrolyzed using a continuous tubular fast pyrolysis reactor. Mass balance analysis and formation of the 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), characterized by USEPA as priority pollutants, and was studied during the pyrolysis process in a wide range of operation conditions, i.e., reaction temperature (300–700 °C), residence time (100–190 s) and waste particle size (1–3 cm). Response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were applied to optimize the operating variables. Cracking and decomposition of feedstock occurred almost optimally in 700 °C resulting in the generation of 73.4% liquid and 24.1% char. The PAHs were characterized in significant concentrations in pyrolytic oil (121–29440 mg/lit) and char (223–1610 mg/kg) products. The formation of total USEPA listed PAH components varied by the operating ranges of temperature, residence time and waste size. In the pyrolytic oil phase, the formation of total PAHs was drastically increased by increasing the waste particle size. It is also found that increasing the temperature and having longer residence times have a high influence on the total 16 USEPA PAHs formation rate in the char phase. It is concluded that fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste, as thermal treatment method, would influence the formation and destruction of PAHs and their fraction to a different extent depending on the role of operating variables.","The study involves lab-scale fast pyrolysis of hazardous health-care waste (a type of plastic-containing waste) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed characterization of PAHs in oil and char, confirming experimental data and plastic pyrolysis."
"Biomass-derived porous carbon-supported nickel–iron bimetallic nanocatalysts for the catalytic conversion of plastics into oil and carbon nanotubes The conversion of waste plastics into high-value products through catalytic cracking offers a promising solution to plastic pollution. This study developed a novel method to synthesize porous carbon-based catalysts (0.1FeNi-MEC, 0.15FeNi-MEC, and 0.2FeNi-MEC) loaded with iron-nickel bimetallic nanoparticles using rapid, energy-efficient microwave pyrolysis with biomass as a sustainable precursor. These catalysts were applied to the pyrolysis of polypropylene and polystyrene, enabling the simultaneous production of high-quality oil and carbon nanotubes. During biomass pyrolysis, iron and nickel ions facilitated pore expansion and were in-situ reduced to Fe3Ni2 nanoparticles, uniformly anchored on the porous carbon skeleton. The oil yield from polypropylene and polystyrene pyrolysis decreased with increasing temperature, with styrene and small-molecule oils (e.g., toluene) dominating below 600 °C. At 600 °C, the 0.2FeNi-MEC catalyst achieved a carbon nanotube yield of approximately 30% from polystyrene pyrolysis, with carbon nanotube diameters mainly around 40 nm, while polypropylene pyrolysis yielded about 20% carbon nanotubes. This study innovatively utilized microwave-prepared carbon-based catalysts, demonstrating a sustainable strategy for plastic waste management and nanomaterial production, contributing to the circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of waste plastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polystyrene via infrared heating to produce light aromatic hydrocarbons The co-pyrolysis of coal and waste plastics is a viable method for achieving efficient and clean utilization of coal and waste and enhancing light aromatic hydrocarbon production. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polystyrene (PS) was carried out via rapid infrared heating in a fixed bed reactor with varying mixing ratios to investigate the product distribution, tar composition, and char characteristics. The results revealed that the increase of PS mixing ratio increased the interaction of the co-pyrolysis volatiles, which raised the tar and light aromatic hydrocarbons yield. Especially for the mixing ratio of coal/PS being 7:3, the content of styrene and ethylbenzene in tar is 31.5 % and 15.2 % higher than the theoretically calculated value, respectively. Moreover, co-pyrolysis promoted the interaction between volatiles to produce biphenyls such as 1,3-diphenylpropane. Electron paramagnetic resonance results indicated that the co-pyrolysis char exhibited higher amounts of methoxy ether and 1–3 cyclic π quinone free radicals, which was consistent with the decrease of phenols in the tar.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) and coal in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, tar composition analysis, and char characterization."
"Zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: Machine learning prediction, interpretation, and optimization Converting waste plastics into renewable energy through zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis is a promising strategy for combating plastic pollution and supplanting conventional fossil fuels, thereby facilitating emission mitigation. However, it is still challenging to comprehensively decipherer this conversion process and screen efficient catalysts for diverse plastic feedstocks to improve the yield and quality of the resultant liquid fuel. This work explored the importance and correlations of factors in zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis and aided the zeolite screening and optimization of operational conditions for improving the oil yield and quality via machine learning (ML)-based interpretation and inverse design. The results indicated that the Extreme Gradient Boosting model developed from the complied dataset after feature selection exhibited the best performance (testing R2 of 0.85 and 0.87) for predicting the yields of liquid oil and gasoline-range (C5-C12) hydrocarbons among three tree-based algorithms. The ML-based interpretation showed that the polyethylene ratio in plastic feedstock, the reaction temperature, specific surface area, and Si/Al ratio of zeolites were the top-four important features, and their impacts on the yields of liquid oil and C5-C12 hydrocarbons were discussed in detail. A maximum oil yield of 80.85 % was achieved from ML-based inverse design, and the corresponding optimal inputs from the model could guide the experimental investigation. It showed that a high oil yield of 87.82 % was obtained from experiment that was even higher than the model result with a small error of −7.93 %. This work provides a novel ML-based approach to understand the zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics and improve the yield and quality of liquid oil for sustainable energy production.","The study involves lab-scale experimental validation of zeolite-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization."
"Production of hydrocarbons by catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene in a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor High density polyethylene (HDPE) was pyrolysed over different catalysts using an in-house designed laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating in the 290–430°C range under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts used were HZSM-5, Silicalite, HMOR, HUSY and SAHA and the yield of volatile hydrocarbons (based on the feed) was typically HZSM-5>HUSY≈HMOR>SAHA. Product streams varied markedly with catalysts type and structure. The sodium form of siliceous ZSM-5, silicalite, containing very few or no catalytically active sites, gave very low conversions of polymer to volatile hydrocarbons. HZSM-5 and SAHA produced more olefinic streams with HZSM-5 yielding over 80wt% olefins in the C3–C5 range compared with around 40wt% with SAHA. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffinic streams with large amounts of C4 (19 and 14wt%, respectively) and both catalysts deactivated during the course of the degradation. Observed differences in product yields and product distributions under identical reaction conditions can be attributed to the microstructure of catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of oil sludge with HDPE to obtain paraffinic products over HUSY zeolites prepared by dealumination and desilication Oil sludge is a waste from the oil industry with a complex composition and its treatment is still a challenge. In addition, polyolefin waste is becoming a problem due to its accumulation and slow degradation. In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis was used to treat oil sludge and high density polyethylene (HDPE) at 450 °C and at an atmospheric pressure for 15 min to generate paraffin-rich oily products. Y zeolites were obtained by dealumination and desilication processes which were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, FTIR, 29Si and 27Al NMR, TG and NH3 TPD. Pristine and modified zeolites were evaluated in the co-pyrolysis in order to assess their performances through the quality of the obtained pyrolytic oil (GC–MS and SimDis). The modificated zeolites presented higher mesoporosity than the original solid as so lower total acidity. Amidst the tested catalysts, Mod-Si-10 and Mod-Al presented the best performances showing high yield of liquid fraction, rich in parafinic light hydrocarbons, probably due to their moderate acidity and improved mesoporosity. Consequently, these two zeolites presented outstanding catalytic characteristics alongside high selectivity to paraffinic hydrocarbons in the diesel fraction from co-pyrolisis of the oil sludge waste with HDPE.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste HDPE and oil sludge, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions explicitly reported."
"Pyrolysis of mixed plastics into aromatics Mixed plastics collected from the DSD (Duales System Deutschland), different in their content of polyesters and polystyrene, were pyrolyzed in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor to yield aromatic oils and heat-providing gas. Four experiments were carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at different temperatures between 685 and 738°C and feed rates between 400 and 900 g h−1. The most important oil products were benzene, toluene, xylenes and styrene with a total yield of 30–40% by weight. The results are compared to those of a technical scale reactor with a longer residence time. It was shown that the concentration of chloro-organic compounds in the oil decreases at longer residence times.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions."
"The behavior of heteroatom compounds during the pyrolysis of waste composite plastics Multilayer composite packaging plastic is commonly used in daily life. Due to the complex structures and the existence of heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, the recycling of this kind of plastic is challenging. Recycling through the pyrolysis method may provide an efficient option with respect to the mechanical and solvent methods. An understanding of the behaviour of heteroatoms during pyrolysis is significant to optimize the operating conditions. In this work, two composite packaging plastics of PET/LDPE (Polyethylene Terephthalate/Low Density Polyethylene) and PA/LDPE (Polyamide//Low Density Polyethylene) were pyrolysed at various temperatures between 400 and 500 °C in a fixed bed reactor. Heteroatom balance and composition analysis were conducted. Especially, the composition of O- and N-containing compounds in oils was fully understood by using GC-MS (Gas Chromatograph - Mass Spectrometer) and APPI FT-ICR MS (Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer) instruments. At 400 °C, only 2.2 wt% oxygen was left in 53.9 wt% solid residues for PET/LDPE and 3.6 wt% nitrogen was retained in 61.0 wt% solid residues for PA6/LDPE, whereas nearly no oxygen was retained in solid residues for PA6/LDPE. So the PET/PA6 can be degraded in a much lower temperature range than LDPE indicating the possibility of separating heteroatoms by step-wise pyrolysis. A large amount of O-containing compounds were observed in oils from PET/LDPE pyrolysis, while O, N-containing compounds existed in oils from PA6/LDPE. The APPI FT-ICR MS analysis revealed that parts of O-containing compounds were generated through the interaction between O-containing functional groups and aliphatics during the PET/LDPE pyrolysis. For PA6/LDPE, the deoxygenation reaction was easier to occur than the denitrification reaction.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste composite plastics (PET/LDPE and PA/LDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization of oil composition using GC-MS and APPI FT-ICR MS."
"Catalytic hydroreforming of the polyethylene thermal cracking oil over Ni supported hierarchical zeolites and mesostructured aluminosilicates The hydroreforming of the liquid product resulting from LDPE thermal cracking at 400°C (C5–C40) has been studied using Ni supported hierarchical zeolites (Ni/h-ZSM-5, Ni/h-Beta) and mesostructured materials (Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-SBA-15) as catalysts. Hydroreforming experiments were carried out at 310°C under 20bar of hydrogen. All the catalysts were synthesized with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 30 and a Ni content of 7wt%. According to XRD, TPR and TEM data, the activated catalysts displayed Ni particles both over the external surface and inside the catalyst pores in different percentages depending on their porous structure and nature. Complete hydrogenation of the olefins was observed over both mesostructured catalysts (Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni/Al-MCM-41) and hierarchical Ni/h-Beta. In contrast, over Ni/h-ZSM-5, there is always left about 30% of olefins, due to an imbalance in the acid and metal function. Ni/h-ZSM-5 led towards significant amounts of gases (∼18%) while gasoline range hydrocarbons were the main products (55%) over Ni/h-Beta, at the expense of diesel fractions. In contrast, the hydrocracking extent was far lower over Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-SBA-15, the latter showing additionally the appearance of a slight degree of oligomerization, which led towards an increase in the heavy diesel fraction (C19–C40). Hydroisomerization reactions also occur, mostly in the case of Ni supported hierarchical zeolites. Likewise, aromatics were formed over these catalysts in a large extent. The RON number of the gasolines obtained at 310°C was within 81–89 depending on the chosen catalysts while the cetane index (CCI) of the diesel fraction was around 70–80. On the other hand, Ni leaching was not detected.","The study involves pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) followed by catalytic hydroreforming of the resulting oil, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and fuel properties analyzed."
"Evaluation of pyrolysis product of virgin high density polyethylene degradation using different process parameters in a stirred reactor The yield as well as molecular weight and composition of the condensed product generated from the HDPE was studied to gain insight into the role of temperature, equilibrium FCC catalyst, agitator speed and carrier gas on the pyrolysis products. Pyrolysis was done in a suite stirred bucchi stainless-steel autoclave reactor. The effect of process parameters such as degradation temperature, catalyst/polymer ratio (%), carrier gas type and stirrer rate on the condensed product yield and composition was determined. Reaction products were determined by GC analysis and shown to contain naphthenes (cycloalkanes), paraffins (alkanes), olefins (alkenes) and aromatics. The maximum “fuel like” condensed product yields were at 450°C and 10% catalyst, respectively. The influence of different types of carrier gasses with varied molecular weights and reactivity was studied. Hydrogen as a reactive carrier gas increased the condensed and paraffinic product yield. Appropriate heat transfer – by stirring – can increase the catalyst efficiency in a stirred reactor. It is demonstrated that the use of equilibrium FCC commercial catalyst under appropriate reaction conditions can have the ability to control both the condensed yield and carbon number distribution from HDPE degradation, and thus potentially decrease the process cost with more valuable hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of virgin HDPE in a stirred reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis via GC."
"From wood plastic composite waste to high-value aromatics via catalytic pyrolysis over an activated carbon The catalytic pyrolysis of cornstalk/high density polyethylene composite (CHC) over H3PO4 activated carbon (AC) catalyst was carried out in a fixed bed reactor. The effects of pyrolysis temperature and AC to CHC ratio on product yield and chemical composition were investigated. Results showed that the pyrolysis oil yield was in the range of 20.4–49.1 %, which decreased with increasing temperature and AC to CHC ratio. The gas yield exhibited a different trend with the pyrolysis oil. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature and AC to CHC ratio, the yield of aromatics first increased and then decreased, reaching its maximum at 578 °C and AC to CHC ratio of 1.75. The AC catalyst was reused five times and was characterized by BET, FTIR and SEM-EDS. The yield of aromatics exhibited a positive linear correlation with pore volume and BET surface area. As the reuse time of AC catalyst increased to five, the yield of aromatics decreased due to the significant reduction in BET surface area and pore volume of AC catalyst. The number of P-containing functional groups partly disappeared, which was also associated with a decrease in the catalytic activity of AC catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE-based wood plastic composite in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst characterization."
"Mechanism of microwave-assisted iron-based catalyst pyrolysis of discarded COVID-19 masks Inexpensive iron-based catalysts are the most promising catalysts for microwave pyrolysis of waste plastics, especially a large number of disposable medical masks (DMMs) with biological hazards produced by spread of COVID-19. However, most synthesized iron-based catalysts have very low microwave heating efficiency due to the enrichment state of iron. Here, we prepared FeAlOx catalysts using the microwave heating method and found that the microwave heating efficiency of amorphous iron and hematite is very low, indeed, these materials can hardly initiate pyrolysis at room temperature, which limits the application of iron-based catalysts in microwave pyrolysis. By contrast, a mixture of DMMs and low-valent iron oxides produced by hydrogen reduction at 500 °C can be heated by microwaves to temperatures above 900 °C under the same conditions. When the hydrogen reduction temperature was incerased to 800 °C, the content of metallic iron in the catalyst gradually increased from 0.34 to 21.43%, which enhanced the microwave response ability of the catalyst, and decreased the gas content in the pyrolysis product from 78.91 to 70.93 wt%; corresponding hydrogen yield also decreased from 29.03 to 25.02 mmolH2·g-1 DMMs. Moreover, the morphology of the deposited solid carbon gradually changed from multi-walled CNTs to bamboo-like CNTs. This study clarifies the pyrolysis mechanism of microwave-assisted iron catalysts and lays a theoretical foundation for their application in microwave pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of discarded COVID-19 masks (a waste plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Non-recyclable municipal solid waste characterization and pyrolysis for energy recovery European regulations require that by 2030 waste suitable for recycling, material recovery, or energy recovery will no longer be allowed to end up in landfills. Material composition in non-recyclable MSW bins dictates which valorization measures could be implemented. This study examines 32 non-recyclable MSW bins in the Getafe municipality (Spain). The bulk non-recyclable MSW bin is separated into 15 residue materials along with non-combustible materials. Merely 18.1 % of the non-recyclable MSW bins occupy non-recyclable waste. This indicates inadequate separation at source. MSW samples are grouped into six clusters with similar properties using the K-nearest neighbor methodology. Representative sample from each cluster is pyrolyzed at 520 °C. The main product of pyrolysis is liquid, which makes up 57.9 wt%, while solid and gas fractions are 16.4 and 16.5 wt%, respectively. Liquid fraction is a blend of aromatic, aliphatic, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds, while CO2 is the main gas compound.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of non-recyclable municipal solid waste containing plastic materials at 520 °C, with measurable product yields and detailed product composition analysis."
"Migration characteristics of chlorine during pyrolysis of municipal solid waste pellets The migration process of chlorine during municipal solid waste (MSW) pellets pyrolysis was studied in a fixed bed reactor. Distribution and speciation changes of chlorine at different pyrolysis temperatures were determined by ion chromatography (IC) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Results showed that chlorine was mainly distributed in pyrolysis char (42.36–65.29 %) and gas (26.66–35.03 %) after MSW pellets pyrolysis. With the temperature increasing, chlorine in char and tar was enriched due to the increase of chlorine release and the decrease of product yields, with chlorine concentration increasing to 3498 ppm and 1415 ppm at 800 °C, respectively. Results of chlorine forms analysis indicated that most of the organic-Cl in MSW was released into the volatiles during pyrolysis due to the dissociation of CCl. Inorganic-Cl became the dominant form of chlorine in char after pyrolysis, with the proportion increasing from 46.69 % (raw) to 61.22 % (500 °C), which also suggested that part of organic-Cl was converted into the inorganic-Cl. Notably, the proportions of inorganic-Cl decreased at >600 °C due to the migration of inorganic. In addition, the pyrolysis release behavior of chlorine was affected by the pore structure of char, which could be inhibited by the unprosperous pores in char, especially at low temperatures (<600 °C). These findings provided a reference for the chlorine regulation of MSW pyrolytic products.","The study involves pyrolysis of municipal solid waste pellets, a form of mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent chlorine distribution, and analytical characterization using IC and XPS."
"Vacuum pyrolysis of PVC I. Kinetic study Vacuum pyrolysis of PVC has been studied emphasizing two aspects: the kinetics of PVC pyrolysis reactions and the yields of pyrolysis products. The purpose of the kinetic study is to identify each apparent reaction involved in PVC pyrolysis. Three stages of weight loss have been evidenced by TG analysis during PVC decomposition both under vacuum and in nitrogen atmosphere, while in most previous studies carried out under similar conditions only two stages were detected. The corresponding temperature intervals of these three stages are: 200–320°C; 250–375°C and 375–520°C. Based on the TG results, a three-apparent-reactions model is proposed. Kinetic parameters and conversion factors have been calculated for each apparent reaction with this model including all three stages of decomposition. Some results are in good accordance with literature data. Bench scale PVC pyrolysis tests were carried out to collect the pyrolysis products from each single apparent reaction. These products were analyzed and a correlation with TG results was made in order to assign these results to a certain change of the PVC structure. These findings provide new insights into the PVC thermal decomposition and useful data for controlling the release of HCl during PVC pyrolysis have been made available.","The study involves lab-scale vacuum pyrolysis of PVC waste plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent decomposition stages, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Production of carbon nanotubes via catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst: The influence of plastic types Thermochemical conversion is a promising technology to convert waste plastics into high-value chemicals from both an economic and environmental point of view. In this work, the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from catalytic pyrolysis of different types waste plastics over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used as raw material. The results show that PS showed a higher solid carbon yield of 32.24 wt%. PE waste plastic led to the lowest liquid yield and the highest gas yield, which were 28.95 wt% and 39.45 wt%, respectively. In terms of obtained CNTs, PE and PP plastics obtained more high-purity, structured and intertwined multi-wall carbon nanotubes, while PS produced more amorphous carbon. PET plastic had high oxygen content, which was not conducive to the growth of CNTs during the pyrolysis process. In summary, PE and PP plastics were suitable as feedstock for the preparation of high-quality CNTs by pyrolysis catalysis. The work provides basic data support for the research of the production of valuable CNTs from waste plastics.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Resource recovery from discarded COVID-19 PPE kit through catalytic fast pyrolysis During the COVID-19 pandemic, the world saw an exponential surge in the production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, which eventually got discarded in the biomedical waste stream. In this study, thirteen different polymer samples from the PPE kit were collected and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, thermogravimetric analysis, and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry. The characterization data showed that about 94 % by mass of components were made of only three polymers, viz. polypropylene (PP, 75.6 wt %), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 12.5 wt %), and polycarbonate (PC, 6 wt %). The analytical pyrolysis of the PPE coverall suit (PP) yielded mainly alkenes containing 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene as the major compound with 17 wt % yield at 600 °C. The pyrolysates from face shield (PET) were rich in benzoic acid (5.8 wt %) and acetophenone (4.8 wt %), while those from safety goggles (PC) were rich in phenol (17.6 wt %) and p-cresol (12.4 wt %) at 600 °C. HZSM-5 and HY zeolites were used for the catalytic upgradation of pyrolysates especially from PP, PET and PC. The temperature and feed-to-catalyst ratio were optimized by performing catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments at 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C with different feed-to-catalyst ratios 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6 (w/w). The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons, viz., BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) and naphthalene, was maximum (∼25.7 wt %) from PP coverall when HY catalyst was used at 600 °C and 1:6 (w/w) loading. In the case of PET face shield, the total yield of BTEX, naphthalene and biphenyl was maximum (27.9 wt %) at 600 °C and 1:4 (w/w) of HZSM-5, while in the case of PC goggles, it was maximum (18.6 wt %) at 700 °C and 1:4 (w/w) of HY. This study shows that the entire PPE kit can be valorized via catalytic fast pyrolysis to generate petrochemical products and platform molecules like monoaromatic hydrocarbons at high selectivities.","The study involves catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PET, PC) from PPE kits, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Nano-crystallite oriented self-assembled ZSM-5 zeolite and its LDPE cracking properties: Effects of accessibility and strength of acid sites Nano-crystallite oriented self-assembled ZSM-5 zeolite (NS-Z5) is successfully synthesized with high yield of 85% by a facile salt-aided seed-induced method within 1.5h at TPABr (tetrapropylammonium bromide)/SiO2 ratio of 0.1. The systematic and thorough characterizations, involving morphology, textural/structure property, and acidity, indicate that NS-Z5 particle is composed of oriented-assembled high-crystalline zeolite MFI nano-crystallites and possesses abundant accessible strong acid sites due to its large/rough external surface. The strong acidity of NS-Z5 sample results from its high crystallinity and few framework defects benefiting from the introduction of seeds. The catalytic evaluations both in batch and in thermogravimetric reactors demonstrate the important roles of the accessibility and strength of acid sites on low-density polypropylene cracking. This paper provides a facile method for preparation of hierarchical high-crystalline ZSM-5 nano-zeolite and confirms the significance to synchronously maintain large amount and high strength of accessible acid sites on large molecule conversion.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE using a synthesized ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst, with measured catalytic performance and characterization of acid site accessibility and strength affecting product yields."
"The behaviour of plastic particles during pyrolysis in bubbling fluidized bed reactors: Incipient agglomeration and axial segregation Plastic-fluidized bed interaction has been investigated by non-invasive X-ray imaging techniques in the temperature range of 500–650 °C and under pyrolysis conditions. Experiments were conducted by feeding a single polypropylene particle using either overbed or underbed feeding methods. The fluidized bed was operated from minimum fluidization conditions to bubbling regime, up to 2Umf. Interestingly, experimental observations show that the understanding of the mixing/segregation behaviour of polypropylene in a hot fluidized bed does not appear to be as straightforward as in the case of more conventional feedstocks, such as biomass. Further analysis and an alternative point of view to investigate the complex behaviour observed for plastic feedstock have been provided. The interaction between the fluidized bed and a single polypropylene particle was modelled by means of an axial segregation model, and a physics-assisted stochastic approach. In the second case, it was possible to simulate the formation of the sand-plastic agglomerate (incipient agglomeration stage) and the evolution of its density over time. The models were then validated by means of axial segregation data obtained via X-ray imaging techniques and by measuring the physical properties of real sand-polypropylene agglomerates produced within the bed operating at high temperatures. Results obtained in this study show that the unpredictable sinking-floating behaviour of the plastic particles is not related to the change in density associated to the formation of the sand-polypropylene agglomerates over time.","The study involves pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor with measurable experimental conditions, product behavior, and analytical characterization using X-ray imaging and physical property measurements."
"Catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene over mesoporous and microporous catalysts in a fluidised-bed reactor High density polyethylene (HDPE) was pyrolysed over various catalysts using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. HZSM-5 catalysed degradation resulted in much larger amounts of volatile hydrocarbons compared with degradation over non-zeolitic catalysts (MCM-41 and SAHA). When an HZSM-5 was used as a cracking additive in combination with a non-zeolitic catalyst (MCM-41 and SiO2–Al2O3), the solid mixed catalysts produced less gas with a lower loss of gasoline than HZSM-5. MCM-41 with large mesopores and SAHA with weaker acid sites resulted in a highly olefinic product and gave rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. Both SAHA and MCM-41 materials allow bulky reactions to occur leading to the generation of coke and subsequently deactivation of the catalyst. This paper presents the conversion of polymers to useful hydrocarbons using various cracking catalysts and attempts to provide a basis for optimising the potential benefit of catalytic polymer recycling.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Tertiary polymer recycling: study of polyethylene thermolysis as a first step to synthetic diesel fuel High density polyethylene (HDPE) thermolysis and polyethylene derived oil hydrogenation were studied as two steps of a novel process to convert waste polyethylene (PE) into a hydrocarbon liquid suitable for use as diesel fuel. This report is focused on the thermolysis of PE. The effects of reaction conditions on reaction rate as well as on the physical and chemical properties of the products were examined. Thermolysis products consisted of liquids (PE oil), polymer residue and gas. The liquid product composition was 80–90 wt. % straight chain alkanes and 1-alkenes. Semi-batch reactor thermolysis rates were found to be in good agreement with a theoretical model from the literature. The kinetics of formation of light C6–C11, medium C12–C16 and heavy C17–C20 n-alkane and 1-alkene product fractions from HDPE thermolysis were determined in the temperature range of 400–440°C. Subsequent hydrogenation of the PE oil resulted in a diesel fuel with a high cetane index and low sulphur and aromatic content.","The study involves lab-scale thermolysis of waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent kinetics, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Syngas production from co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of polystyrene and paper with CO2 Co-pyrolysis and CO2 co-gasification of paper and polystyrene blends in different mixture ratios were studied at 1173 K using a laboratory scale tube reactor and thermogravimetric analysis. The chemical composition and yield of the syngas produced was analyzed by a micro gas chromatograph to understand the influence of mixture components. Co-pyrolysis positively impacted the syngas yield exhibiting a synergistic influence on cracking reactions leading to increased gaseous yield having almost double the amounts of hydrogen yield. Co-gasification using CO2 increased the total gas yield with enhanced synergistic conversion. This effect provided a non-linear impact on the combustible gases in the gaseous yields when compared to the separate gasification of these feedstocks. The synergistic enhancement of co-pyrolysis conversion in paper-polystyrene led to lower char present for CO2 to react during CO2 co-gasification that lead to lower CO during the gasification of this blended char residue. The mixtures of paper with polystyrene provided increased product gas yields and enhanced conversion with an increase in polystyrene content. The results showed the effectiveness of producing high energy density syngas from co-gasification which can alleviate material handling issues present in segregation of waste, such as plastics and biomass providing uniform valuable product from diverse waste feedstocks with minimal need for classification.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polystyrene, a waste plastic, with paper, including measurable syngas yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"Influence of plastic content on synergistic effect and bio-oil quality from the co-pyrolysis of waste rigid polyurethane foam and sawdust mixture Current disposal of end-of-life plastics by landfilling or incineration raises serious environmental concerns, simultaneously representing an irretrievable loss of valuable resources. Especially this is evident for materials that have a complex structure, like polyurethane foams. In this work, co-pyrolysis with sawdust was carried out to analyze and evaluate the product quality for further utilization as alternative fuels. The introduction of polyurethane increased the oil yield but in a limited range since no significant difference was observed between the mixture with 25 and 75% of polyurethane content. In addition, the chemical analysis showed that small addition of polyurethane is sufficient to eliminate most of the oxygenated compounds derived from sawdust. Nevertheless, the obtained liquid products are mostly benzenamines that do not meet the criteria for fuel composition. Analysis of the synergistic effect shows that the strongest impact is visible for a small branch of plastic content where liquid yield was promoted at the expense of gas. With a further increment of plastic content, this effect fades away, except for the solid residue where remains constant. Finally, a brief analysis of the gaseous fraction showed that obtained products are preferred in syngas composition, with notable hydrogen yield as the most valuable constituent.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste rigid polyurethane foam (a plastic) and sawdust, with measurable product yields, chemical analysis, and synergistic effect evaluation."
"Pyrolysis kinetic behavior and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of metallised food packaging plastics Metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW) is the most complex fraction of plastic waste ever. Pyrolysis treatment is one of the most promising technologies that could be used to convert the plastic fraction of MFPW into energy products and to recover aluminum fraction mixed with char. Within this frame, this research aims to study the volatile products released from pyrolysis of MFPW and their kinetics by using the TG-FTIR/GC–MS system. The experiments were performed on six different types of MFPW (potato chips, chocolate, bakery, coffee, and biscuits) and its mixture. The developed strategy started with analysis of the selected MFPW samples and the proximate analysis showed that the samples were rich with volatile matter content (till 99.5 wt%). In parallel, DMCHA dissolution treatment was used for preliminary experiments to determine the total number and types of plastic layers in MFPW confined to EVA, PET, and LDPE. Afterwards, the TG-FTIR system was used to investigate the thermal and chemical degradation of the MFPW samples up to 900 °C at different heating rates (5-30˚C/min), while the GC/MS system was used to study the volatile products generated from MFPW samples at the maximum decomposition temperatures (467-485˚C). Finally, the model-free methods (Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa, and Friedman) were used to develop the kinetic model of pyrolysis of the MFPW samples. The results showed that the main decomposition of the MFPW samples happened in the range 360-500˚C with mass loss of 67–96%, while the kinetic models indicated that the mean activation energies for the mixture sample were estimated at 288.8 kJ/mol (Kissinger), 287.8 KJ/mol (KAS), 314.5 KJ/mol (FWO), and 307.9 KJ/mol (Friedman). Finally, the FTIR spectra and GC–MS results showed that Propene and Furan (7.6%), 2,4-Dimethyl-1-heptene and Isopropylcyclobutane (43.16%), etc. compounds were strongly present in the released volatile products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste metallised food packaging plastics (MFPW), with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization using TG-FTIR-GC–MS, including kinetic modeling and volatile product analysis."
"Effect of plastic waste types on pyrolysis liquid oil This paper aims to examine the effect of different plastic waste types such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on the yield and quality of produced liquid oil from the pyrolysis process. A small pilot scale pyrolysis reactor was commissioned for this purpose, and operated at optimum temperature and retention time of 450 °C and 75 min respectively. PS plastic waste showed maximum production of liquid oil (80.8%) along with least production of gases (13%) and char (6.2%) in comparison to other plastic types. Liquid oils from all plastic types contained mostly aromatic compounds with some alkanes and alkenes. Liquid oil from PS pyrolysis contained styrene (48.3%), ethylbenzene (21.2%) and toluene (25.6%). Pyrolysis liquid oils found to have ranges of dynamic viscosity (1.77–1.90 mPa s), kinematic viscosity (1.92–2.09 cSt), density (0.91–0.92 g/cm3), pour point (−11(-60 °C)), freezing point (−15-(-65 °C)), flash point (28.1–30.2 °C) and high heating value (HHV) (41.4–41.8 MJ/kg) similar to conventional diesel, thus have potential as an alternative energy source for electricity generation. Upgrading of liquid oil using different post-treatment methods such as distillation, refining and blending with conventional diesel is required to make it suitable as a transport fuel due to presence of high aromatic compounds. The recovery of aromatic compounds especially styrene from pyrolysis oil can be a potential source of precursor chemical in industries for polymerization of styrene monomers.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PS, PE, PP, PET) with measured product yields, detailed product composition analysis, and reactor conditions, satisfying all mandatory criteria."
"Low chlorine oil production through fast pyrolysis of mixed plastics combined with hydrothermal dechlorination pretreatment Fast pyrolysis of the mixed plastics (PE: PP: PS: PVC = 0.5: 0.3: 0.15: 0.05) with and without hydrothermal dechlorination pretreatment were investigated in a fixed bed reactor to determine the effects of pyrolysis parameters (temperature, carrier gas flow rate and particle size) on the distribution and the quality of the products. The results showed that high pyrolysis temperature, high carrier gas flow rate and small particle size promoted the migration of organic chlorine in condensable products to inorganic chlorine in gas products. And the optimal conditions for fast pyrolysis of mixed plastics to produce oil were the pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, carrier gas flow rate of 40 ml/min and particle size of 0.1–0.15 mm with the maximum oil yield of 67.88 wt%. Hydrothermal pretreatment of mixed plastics has shown an excellent dechlorination efficiency of 99.9 %. Furthermore, the total yield of oil and wax was increased by 7.06 wt%, meanwhile the content of C5-C9 components in the pyrolysis oil showed an upward trend when compared with fast pyrolysis without pretreatment. Besides, the concentration of methane achieved 50.68 % due to the possible weakening effect of hydrothermal pretreatment on CC bond energy of β-position.","The study investigates fast pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of oil composition and dechlorination efficiency."
"Influence of FCC catalyst steaming on HDPE pyrolysis product distribution A commercial FCC catalyst based on a zeolite active phase has been used in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE. The experimental runs have been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor provided with a feeding system for continuous operation. Different treatments have been applied to the catalyst to improve its behaviour. This paper deals with the optimization of catalyst steaming and pyrolysis temperature in order to maximize the production of diesel-oil fraction. The performance of the fresh catalyst has been firstly studied at 500°C. This catalyst gives way to 52wt% gas yield, 35wt% light liquid fraction and a low yield of C10 + fraction (13wt%). After mild steaming (5h at 760°C) the results show a significant improvement in product distribution. Thus, gas yield decreases to 22wt%, the yield of light liquid is similar to that of the fresh one (38wt%), whereas the yield of the desired C10 + fraction increases to 38wt%. Nevertheless, the best results have been obtained when a severe steaming is applied to the catalyst (8h at 816°C) and pyrolysis temperature is reduced to 475°C. There is a significant reduction in the gaseous fraction (8wt%). The light liquid fraction has also been reduced to 22wt%, but the yield of diesel fraction increases to 69wt%. Moreover, the deactivation of the catalyst has also been studied under the optimum conditions.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance data."
"Influence of temperature and reaction time on the conversion of polystyrene waste to pyrolysis liquid oil This paper aims to investigate the effect of temperature and reaction time on the yield and quality of liquid oil produced from a pyrolysis process. Polystyrene (PS) type plastic waste was used as a feedstock in a small pilot scale batch pyrolysis reactor. At 400°C with a reaction time of 75min, the gas yield was 8% by mass, the char yield was 16% by mass, while the liquid oil yield was 76% by mass. Raising the temperature to 450°C increased the gas production to 13% by mass, reduced the char production to 6.2% and increased the liquid oil yield to 80.8% by mass. The optimum temperature and reaction time was found to be 450°C and 75min. The liquid oil at optimum conditions had a dynamic viscosity of 1.77mPas, kinematic viscosity of 1.92cSt, a density of 0.92g/cm3, a pour point of −60°C, a freezing point of −64°C, a flash point of 30.2°C and a high heating value (HHV) of 41.6MJ/kg this is similar to conventional diesel. The gas chromatography with mass spectrophotometry (GC–MS) analysis showed that liquid oil contains mainly styrene (48%), toluene (26%) and ethyl-benzene (21%) compounds.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene waste plastic with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions, including experimental characterization and quantifiable results."
"Valorization of synthetic textile waste using CO2 as a raw material in the catalytic pyrolysis process Since an invention of synthetic fibers (textiles), our life quality has been improved. However, the cumulative production and disposal of them have perceived as significant since they are not biodegradable and hard to be upcycled/recycled. From washing textiles, microplastics are released into the environment, which are regarded as emerging contaminants. As a means for source reduction of microplastics, this study proposed a rapid disposal platform for waste textiles (WTs), converting them into value-added products. To this end, catalytic pyrolysis of WT was studied. To offer more environmentally sound process, CO2 was used as a raw material for WT pyrolysis. Thermal cracking of WT led to the production of syngas and CH4 under the CO2 environment. CO2 resulted in additional CO production via gas phase reaction with volatile compounds evolved from pyrolysis of WT. To expedite the reaction kinetics for syngas formation, catalytic pyrolysis was done over Co-based catalyst. Comparing to non-catalytic pyrolysis, CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis had 3- and 8-times higher production of H2 and CO, respectively. This process also suppressed catalyst deactivation, converting more than 80 wt% of WT into syngas and CH4. The more generation of CO from the use of CO2 as a raw material offers an effective means to minimize the formations of harmful chemical species, such as benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of synthetic textile waste, a type of plastic waste, with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data reported."
"Influence of promoting Ni-based catalysts with ruthenium in the dry reforming of polypropylene plastics for syngas production The catalytic dry reforming of plastic waste is conducted in two-stage fixed bed reactors. The pyrolysis of polypropylene plastics occurs in the first reactor, and the pyrolyzed gases undergo a reforming reaction with carbon dioxide over a catalyst in the second reactor. The wet impregnation method is used to synthesize Ru–Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, which are then calcined and reduced at 800 °C. The results show that as the nickel loading increases, the syngas production increases. Promoting the catalyst with a small quantity of ruthenium significantly improves the plastic conversion into syngas. The dry reforming of polypropylene over 1Ru15Ni/Al2O3 catalyst resulted in the maximum syngas yield (159 mmolsyngas/gPP) at a 2:1 plastic to catalyst ratio. The catalytic dry reforming of plastics is promising for the production of synthesis gas.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic in a fixed-bed reactor followed by catalytic dry reforming, with measurable syngas yields and catalyst performance data reported."
"Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and paper in batch and tubular reactors for in-situ product improvement In this study, a mixture of waste plastics and papers were pyrolyzed under mild conditions in batch and tubular reactors. The decomposition reactions were enhanced by the use of synthetic zeolite-based catalysts to obtain a higher yield of volatiles and modifying the product composition. Especially the decomposition reactions and the product properties obtained from the different reactors were compared. Gases were analysed by GC-FID and GC-TCD. This fraction contains hydrogen, carbon-monoxide, carbon-dioxide and hydrocarbons. The pyrolysis oils have oxygen-containing compounds, such as alcohols, aldehyde, ketones, carboxylic acids or phenol and its derivative. Not only the reactor configurations but also the catalysts had an effect to the product properties, because the catalysts with alkali characters showed advanced behaviour in the reduction of oxygenated hydrocarbons, while high synthetic zeolite catalysts can increase the saturation and isomerization reactions. The long-term behaviour of the pyrolysis oils was followed by an accelerated aging test at 80 °C till 7 days. The catalysts can effectively reduce the rate of density and viscosity increase during the aging and the alkali catalysts showed beneficial properties in reducing the acidic components. In general, the aging properties were more favorable for pyrolysis oils obtained from the tubular reactor compared with the results in batch reactor.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics and paper using batch and tubular reactors with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of oils and gases."
"Impact of plastic type on synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis of rice husk and plastics Pyrolysis of varied type of plastic waste generates distinct reaction intermediates, which affect their co-pyrolysis with biomass feedstock in different ways. This was investigated herein in co-pyrolysis of specific plastic types, including polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polycarbonate (PC), as well as rice husk (RH) at 600–800 °C. The experimental results demonstrated that synergistic mechanisms in the co-pyrolysis were dependent on plastic type. PP provided small hydrogen radicals to pyrolyzates derived from RH, leading to an increase in aromatic production up to 69.5% at 600 °C. PS melted and acted as an insulator, inhibiting oil formation while increasing char yield. Organic acids derived from PET enhanced the char formation and dehydration of RH, resulting in increased levels of char and water. The interaction between RH/PET resulted in a reduction of aromatics by 53.2% at 800 °C because of the synergistic promotion of water formation. In contrast, aromatic structures in PC interfered with degradation of oxygen-containing functional groups in RH, enhancing oil, with aromatics increasing by 35.7% at 700 °C, as well as increased gas yields through promoting decomposition of RH. Furthermore, when all the feedstocks were mixed together, accelerated pyrolytic interactions enhanced the cracking of each individual polymer.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PS, PET, PC) and rice husk, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"A comparative study on pyrolysis of bundle and fluffy shapes of waste packaging plastics The pyrolysis of waste packaging plastic was performed in a semi-batch reactor to study the effect of the shape of reactant on the compositions of pyrolysis oils under N2 gas inflow conditions. Bundle and fluffy shapes of reactants were pyrolyzed at 400 °C for 90 min at N2 inflow rates from 0 to 300 mL/min. The yields of pyrolysis oils were between 67.7 and 76.1% under the reaction conditions, and diesel-like middle oil (C11–C22) was mainly produced with mass fractions over 64%. The main oil product was mostly composed of n-paraffin and n-olefin compounds, and its mass fraction was considerably influenced by the reactant shape and the N2 flow rate. The pyrolysis of the fluff reactant exhibited higher middle oil fractions with higher fraction ratios of n-paraffins to n-olefins than the bundle reactant. This study suggests that the compositions of pyrolysis oil could be controlled by the reactant shape and the N2 inflow, which will provide important information for improving the quality of oil products in a large-scale of pyrolysis processes, and for developing a continuous pyrolysis system because the fluffy shape of reactant is more suitable for continuous feeding.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste packaging plastics with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions, including experimental data on oil yield and composition influenced by reactant shape and N2 flow rate."
"A catalytic reactive distillation approach to high density polyethylene pyrolysis – Part 2 – Middle olefin production A catalytic reactive distillation reactor, previously described, was improved to increase the production of middle and heavy hydrocarbons, to be used as feedstock or fuel in the viewpoint of a Circular Economy of plastics. The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis experiments were run using high density polyethylene (HDPE) under several experimental conditions, with a 1 % (w/w) of HZSM-5 for catalytic pyrolysis. Three different temperatures were tested in each case and the influence of the reaction time was evaluated at 500 °C and 430 °C for thermal pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, respectively. Thermal pyrolysis of HDPE produced the higher amount of solid products (80 %wt. or higher) under the form of a waxy cream-colored material (wax) for all the experimental sets. For catalytic pyrolysis, the major product fraction was always liquid. The analysis of the liquid products showed that, for both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, the products obtained were within the range of C5 to C11, with a higher yield on C8 and C9 in the case of thermal pyrolysis and on C6 and C7 for catalytic pyrolysis. The aim of this study was the development of an integrated reactor/separation system to increase the middle olefin production. It is possible with this reactor design to direct the pyrolysis of HDPE to the production of middle olefins that can be reused in the petrochemistry industry, as chemical feedstock, including in the production of new plastics.","The study involves lab-scale thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis using GC–MS."
"Production of an alternative fuel by the co-pyrolysis of landfill recovered plastic wastes and used lubrication oils This work is a preliminary study for the development of a co-pyrolysis process of plastic wastes excavated from a landfill and used lubrication oils, with the aim to produce an alternative liquid fuel for industrial use. First, thermogravimetric experiments were carried out with pure plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS) and oils (a motor oil and a mixture of used lubrication oils) in order to highlight the interactions occurring between a plastic and an oil during their co-pyrolysis. It appears that the main decomposition event of each component takes place at higher temperatures when the components are mixed than when they are alone, possibly because the two components stabilize each other during their co-pyrolysis. These interactions depend on the nature of the plastic and the oil. In addition, co-pyrolysis experiments were led in a lab-scale reactor using a mixture of excavated plastic wastes and used lubrication oils. On the one hand, the influence of some key operating parameters on the outcome of the process was analyzed. It was possible to produce an alternative fuel for industrial use whose viscosity is lower than 1Pas at 90°C, from a plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction between 40% and 60%, by proceeding at a maximum temperature included in the range 350–400°C. On the other hand, the amount of energy required to successfully co-pyrolyze, in lab conditions, 1kg of plastic/oil mixture with an initial plastic mass fraction of 60% was estimated at about 8MJ. That amount of energy is largely used for the thermal cracking of the molecules. It is also shown that, per kg of mixture introduced in the lab reactor, 29MJ can be recovered from the combustion of the liquid resulting from the co-pyrolysis. Hence, this co-pyrolysis process could be economically viable, provided heat losses are addressed carefully when designing an industrial reactor.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS) and used lubrication oils, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and fuel properties reported."
"Conversion of low density polyethylene (LDPE) over ZSM-5 zeolite to liquid fuel Catalytic cracking of plastics waste to produce fuel is increasingly gaining the attention of researchers worldwide. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of temperature and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on composition of liquid products from catalytic cracking of LDPE dissolved in benzene. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed. The catalytic cracking produced C1C8 hydrocarbons in all runs due to the effective heat exchange between polymer chains and catalysts. Analysis of products composition indicated that catalytic cracking of LDPE generally produced high amount of aliphatic branched-chain compounds, together with moderate amount of cyclic compounds. The reaction conditions also led to alkylation of benzene by the cracking products from LDPE. Hence, it is concluded that the catalytic cracking of LDPE is dominated by free radical mechanism, while the influence of carbenium ion is less pronounced due to low acidity of the catalyst. Overall, it is shown that catalytic cracking of LDPE solution in fixed bed reactor produced higher polymer conversion and liquid yield than conventional reactors and has the potential to extract hydrocarbon energy from recycled polymer waste.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste LDPE plastic in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reaction conditions."
"Reaction synergy of bimetallic catalysts on ZSM-5 support in tailoring plastic pyrolysis for hydrogen and value-added product production Hydrogen, viz. a green energy carrier, is poised to considerably contribute to the empowerment of a sustainable society. By valorizing plastics, catalytic pyrolysis was envisaged as a promising route to produce green hydrogen and value-added product here. Firstly, the screening of optimal catalyst support (from activated carbon and four zeolites: M-zeolite, B-zeolite, Y-zeolite, ZSM-5) was executed by studying catalytic polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis over supported Ni catalysts. In view of the highest H2 yield (19.2 mmol/gPP) of Ni/ZSM-5, ZSM-5 was put forth as the optimal catalyst support. Then, the identification of optimal active metal (from Ni, Fe, Co, FeNi, FeCo, and NiCo) was performed by running the catalytic PP pyrolysis over ZSM-5 supported catalysts. For catalytic PP pyrolysis, NiCo/ZSM-5 was the optimal catalyst with the highest H2 yield (28.7 mmol/gPP), while the resulting pyrolysis oil demonstrated potential for use as jet fuel. From catalytic pyrolysis of various plastics over NiCo/ZSM-5, polystyrene gave the highest H2 composition (83.2 vol%) of pyrolysis gas and high composition (52.8 area%) of benzocyclobutene (useful chemicals for semiconductor and microelectronics fields) in pyrolysis oil. Lastly, the catalytic mechanism was discussed based on the results, revealing NiCo's remarkable enhancement in H2 yield to 28.7 mmol/g, which surpassed the individual yields of Ni (19.2 mmol/g) and Co (10.2 mmol/g), thereby underscoring the synergistic effect of NiCo. This study supports the recycling of plastics waste into hydrogen energy and valuable products, contributing to environmental pollution mitigation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Recovering wax from polyethylene waste using C-DPyR In this work, a new concept of an energetically self-sustaining pyrolysis reactor, C-DPyR, is presented as an alternative to transforming polyethylene waste into wax. TGA and DSC were used to characterize the wax regarding thermal behavior among the recovered materials and perform kinetics computations. ATR-FTIR identified the functional groups constituting the waxes. The experiments that reached great thermal energies resulted in a high amount of gas produced, on average of 74 wt%, confirming that pyrolysis’s heat was more than sufficient to crack the samples. A maximum of about 87 wt% of wax was recovered from an experiment that made 80 kJ of energy available for pyrolysis. It was assumed that the wax degrades through overlapped reactions associated with the main functional groups forming the wax and identified by FTIR. DSC curves evidenced one endothermic valley, 80 J/g, and one exothermic peak, 2115 J/g. The FTIR established the functional wax groups composed mainly of C-H, CH2, and CH3, the same groups present in the FTIR spectra of LDPE. Using isoconversional methods, the wax pyrolysis’s single-step and multi-step kinetic analyses were performed to determine the kinetic triplets. The TGA curves were accurately reconstructed for both approaches, confirming reliable kinetic predictions. Although C-DPyR promises effective thermal energies to drive pyrolytic processes, it is yet most suitable for converting materials that do not require strictly controlled temperatures.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyethylene waste, with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and reactor condition data."
"Generating alternative fuel and bioplastics from medical plastic waste and waste frying oil using microwave co-pyrolysis combined with microbial fermentation In the present study, microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) was used to simultaneously convert medical plastic waste (MPW) and waste frying oil (WFO) into liquid oil products. The MCP process demonstrated a faster heating rate (24 °C/min) and shorter process time (20 min) compared to conventional pyrolysis techniques converting MPW and WFO into liquid oil (≥80 wt%). The MCP reduced the oxygen content from 25.7 to 9.82 wt% in liquid oil encompassing light aliphatic hydrocarbons ranging from C10 to C28, generating a novel sustainable liquid fuel. The liquid having a high carbon content (approximately 77.1 wt%) and low carbon to nitrogen ratio (27.9) is a suitable energy feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) bioplastic production in the form of poly3-hydroxybutyrate [P(3HB)]. The liquid oil acted as an energy source for the growth of Bacillus sp. During microbial fermentation, yielding approximately 11% (w/w) P(3HB). Bioplastics are biodegradable, biocompatible with humans and non-toxic to marine organisms, representing a valuable additive in the production of cosmetics, detergents, and as medical scaffolds for tissue engineering. The results indicate the promising upcycling of waste products by this approach through pyrolytic biorefinery into value-added fuel and bioplastic products, being important for the future sustainable production of renewable resources.","The study involves lab-scale microwave co-pyrolysis of medical plastic waste and waste frying oil, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of the resulting liquid oil."
"Environmentally friendly approach for the recovery of metallic fraction from waste printed circuit boards using pyrolysis and ultrasonication Electronic waste (e-waste) with an annual growth rate of 3–5% is one of the fastest-growing waste streams. The unregulated accumulation and improper recycling can cause grave hazards to human beings and the environment. On the contrary, e-waste can be considered as a secondary source of metals and energy due to its high metal content and polymeric material. Thus, the present study demonstrates technology for the metallic fraction recovery and the production of valuable gases from e-waste. The process involves pyrolysis at a temperature range of 200 °C–600 °C in a fixed bed setup for 10–60 min. Under optimized operating conditions, 35 wt% combustible gases and 60 wt% solid product were obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C in 20 min. The gaseous product consisted of CH4, H2, CO and CO2, having the heating value 28 MJ/kg whereas, the solid product is a mixture of metals and other solid residue material. Treatment of the solid product using an ultrasonication process resulted in around 90 wt% recovery of metallic fraction, thereby leaving behind solid residue. Moreover, the transfer of precious metals (Au, Ag, Pd and Pt) was nearly 100% to the metallic fraction. This process combines mild temperature pyrolysis and ultrasonication process to provide a solution for efficient management of e-waste, metallic fraction recovery and valuable gases production.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards (a form of mixed plastic waste) in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields of gases (35 wt%) and solid products (60 wt%), along with detailed product composition analysis."
"Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust and waste plastics for enhanced aromatic hydrocarbons production using synthesized CeO2/γ-Al2O3 and HZSM-5 Fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust and waste plastic (linear low-density polyethylene, LLDPE) over a dual catalytic stage of synthesized CeO2/γ-Al2O3 and HZSM-5 was conducted to enhance aromatic hydrocarbons production. Experimental results indicated that the catalyst to biomass (C/B) mass ratio played a determining role in the formation of hydrocarbon intermediates and a C/B mass ratio of 4 facilitated the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Dual catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo sawdust and LLDPE using synthesized CeO2/γ-Al2O3 and HZSM-5 increased the concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and a CeO2/γ-Al2O3 to HZSM-5 mass ratio of 1:3 maximized the target products. The content of aromatic hydrocarbons was increased at first and then decreased as the LLDPE percentage was elevated from 20% to 100% during the dual catalytic fast co-pyrolysis process, with the highest concentration obtained at 75% LLDPE percentage. In addition, the additive effect of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was enhanced with the increasing of LLDPE percentage in the feedstock blends, and higher LLDPE proportion favored the production of xylenes, ethylbenzene, and alkylbenzenes as the additive effects were significantly promoted.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (LLDPE) with biomass, including measured product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Oxidative stability of hydrocarbons produced by pyrolysis of polypropylene The instability of liquid oils issued from the pyrolysis of plastics usually leads to the degradation and the deterioration of their different properties. In this study, the stability of oils produced from the pyrolysis with and without reflux of polypropylene (PP) was investigated in a standard test device called PetroOxy. This work compares the stability of PP liquid oils with kerosene throughout their induction period and hydroperoxide (ROOH) content, two well-known stability parameters. Moreover, experimental investigations of the impact of a stabilizer (BHT = butylated hydroxytoluene) on the same stability parameters were achieved. A titration method and GC-MS were used to quantify ROOHs and to identify the oxidized liquid compounds, respectively. PetroOxy tests with BHT showed an enormous influence of BHT on the oxidation stability compared to all other oxidative tests. Adding 500 ppm of BHT multiplied the induction period by 5.9, 4.3, 10.7 and 6.7 for reflux liquid oils, no-reflux liquid oils mixed with kerosene, reflux liquid oils mixed with kerosene and pure kerosene respectively. The ROOH concentration was divided by up to 16.9 for reflux liquid oil when BHT was used. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the liquid oils obtained by pyrolysis with reflux are less stable than without reflux, and both of them are less stable than kerosene used as reference model. But using kerosene as solvent mixed with liquid oils obtained by pyrolysis with and without reflux increases their oxidative stability. The use of BHT as an antioxidant contributes to make these oils compatible for use as fuels.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst-free operation, and analytical characterization including GC-MS and PetroOxy testing for oxidative stability."
"Effect of carbon nanotubes on thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene and polypropylene The goal of this work is to analyze the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the pyrolysis of either high density polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) matrices by using both kinetic thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under non-isothermal conditions and a fixed-bed reactor under isothermal conditions. Under non-isothermal conditions, CNTs increased the beginning of thermodegradation for both matrices with differences as high as 30 °C and 22 °C as compared with neat PP and PE, respectively. This enhanced thermal stability in PP based composites was associated with an increase in the apparent activation energy whereas in PE based composites lower pre-exponential factors associated with reduced conformational entropy, are responsible for the enhanced thermal stability. The thermodecomposition processes were studied by assuming geometrical contraction and nucleation models. The invariant pre-exponential factor and apparent activation energy obtained were quantified for each sample confirming that these values depended on the polymer matrix and concentration of CNTs. These invariant parameters were in good agreement with those obtained by isoconversional analyses allowing the prediction of the thermogravimetric behavior. Our findings clearly showed the strong effect of CNTs on the non-isothermal pyrolysis of polymer materials changing its kinetic and the activation energy. Results from isothermal pyrolysis (450 °C-40′) confirmed the thermal stability by the presence of CNTs as higher condensable (C9–C40) and lower gas (C1–C4) yields in PP-CNTs composites, and a higher amount of unreacted polymer and a lower both condensable and gas yields for PE-CNT, as compared with the pure matrix, were found.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on waste plastics (HDPE and PP) with measurable product yields and analytical characterization, demonstrating catalytic effects of carbon nanotubes on pyrolysis."
"Evolution and speciation transformation of chlorine during automobile shredder residue pyrolysis Disposal of automobile shredder residue (ASR) via pyrolysis enables the recovery of valuable products; however, the production of hazardous pollutants and low-value products is inevitable due to its high chlorine content. In this work, chlorine evolution behavior and the conversion mechanism during ASR pyrolysis between 480 and 600 °C were systematically studied. The experimental results for organic chlorine (Org-Cl) showed that released chlorinated gases were complex, and HCl only accounted for 35% of the gas phase products, while short-chain hydrocarbons with carbon atoms between two and four accounted for 52%. Chlorine was predominantly retained in the char, and Org-Cl was the primary contributor to the residual chlorine, accounting for over 50% of the char. The content of inorganic chlorine (InO-Cl) was low in the raw sample but significantly increased in the char. Through the distinction between organic and inorganic chlorine content in char, it was confirmed that Org-Cl could be converted to InO-Cl due to complex secondary reactions with metallic compounds. The conversion was favored by increasing the Org-Cl content and the temperature. Our findings clarified the evolution mechanism of chlorine and the transformation from Org-Cl to InO-Cl, thus providing guidance for chlorine regulation and the efficient recycling of metal resources.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue, a waste plastic mixture, with measured product yields, chlorine evolution behavior, and analytical characterization of char and gases."

"Fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin and low-density polyethylene with HZSM-5 and MgO for improved bio-oil yield and quality Fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with HZSM-5 and MgO was investigated. Effects of pyrolysis temperature, lignin to LDPE ratio, MgO to HZSM-5 ratio, and feedstock to catalyst ratio on the products yields and chemical profiles were examined. 500°C was the optimal co-pyrolysis temperature in terms of the maximum bio-oil yield. The proportion of aromatics increased with increasing LDPE content. In addition, with the addition of LDPE (lignin/LDPE=1/2), methoxyl group in the phenols was completely removed. A synergistic effect was found between lignin and LDPE. The proportion of aromatics increased and alkylated phenols decreased with increasing HZSM-5 to MgO ratio. The bio-oil yield increased with the addition of appropriate amount of catalyst and the proportion of alkylated phenols increased with increasing catalyst to feedstock ratio.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) with lignin using catalysts, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Thermostatic pyrolysis decapsulation and pollution control of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels: Kinetic analysis and organics evolution The rapid expansion of photovoltaics is anticipated to result in a substantial accumulation of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaics (c-Si PV) panels that composed of glass, silicon wafers, and backsheets. Given its ultra-thin, highly laminated, multi-layered structures encapsulated with polymers, decapsulation is essential for subsequent component separation and recovery. Pyrolysis has emerged as a promising method for decapsulation, yet current research is limited to thermal decomposition of waste c-Si PV panels during the slow heating pyrolysis process, the kinetic mechanism and organics evolution necessary remain unknown. This study proposed the thermostatic pyrolysis of waste c-Si PV panels, and investigated kinetics analysis and organics evolution for efficient decapsulation and pollution control. Our results indicated that decapsulation efficiency can reach 98 % at 600 °C within 7 min, and conformed to the Avrami-Erofeev model, which predicts decapsulation performance across different scenarios well. The thermostatic pyrolysis process generates acetic acid, hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and fluorine-containing substances, all of which can be converted and utilized for pollution control. Further environmental impact assessments demonstrate its minimized environmental impacts over conventional ones. This work provides a viable pathway for the efficient and environmental-friendly decapsulation of waste c-Si PV panels, thereby promoting the development of waste c-Si PV panels recycling industry.","The study involves lab-scale thermostatic pyrolysis of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels, which contain polymer backsheets, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent efficiency, and detailed organics evolution analysis."
"Optimizing the conversion of waste plastic into suitable engine fuel through response surface methodology The extensive utilization of plastic in daily life has significantly contributed to per-day waste generation. The conversion of waste plastic through pyrolysis into fossil fuel is a promising solution to waste management and energy crises. The precise control of the process parameters in the pyrolysis would be a sustainable business model. Since the optimization of process parameters for production yield and the physicochemical properties of waste plastic oil have been underexplored. So, the current research optimized input process parameters of pyrolysis through response surface methodology using a central composite design. The input parameters of the experimental design were reaction temperature (350°C-550°C), retention time (60–300 min), nitrogen flow rate (0–40 ml/s), and ZSM-5 catalyst concentration (1–5 wt%). Waste plastic is converted into the optimized yield of oil (85 %), solid (3 %), and syngas (12 %). Waste plastic oil (WPO) had optimal results of physicochemical properties like heating value (48 MJ/kg), flash point (60 °C), kinematic viscosity (2.1 mm2/s), and density (820 kg/m3). American Society for Testing and Materials Standards validated the produced WPO, which had better fuel properties than petroleum diesel.

"Sustainable production of carbon nanotubes from plastic pyrolysis using Ni- and Fe-biochar catalysts synthesized via hydrothermal treatment The pyrolysis-catalytic decomposition process has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing plastic pollution by upcycling plastic waste into high-value carbon nanomaterials (CNMs). Traditional biochar-based catalysts face challenges in CNMs yield and carbon species. This study introduces Ni- and Fe-loaded biochar catalysts synthesized via hydrothermal (HT) treatment for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen production. The Ni/BC-24HT catalyst at 800 °C achieved the highest CNT yield (608 mg/gPS) and H2 selectivity (80.5 vol%, 23.1 mmol/gPS), surpassing wet impregnation (WI) catalysts and overcoming biochar’s limitations in CNT production. HT synthesis enhances inherent metal dispersion by replacing native minerals through ion exchange, effectively purifying the biochar catalyst by removing inherent metals while simultaneously incorporating the active metal onto the support, thereby improving catalytic performance. Ni and Fe3C in spent catalysts confirm CNT growth via surface/interface diffusion for Ni/BC-24HT and bulk diffusion for Fe/BC-24HT, explaining the higher CNT yield in Ni-loaded catalysts. Recycling tests demonstrated structural stability over five cycles, indicating durability and potential for extended applications with appropriate regeneration strategies.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic waste using Ni- and Fe-biochar catalysts, with measurable yields of carbon nanotubes and hydrogen, characterized by catalyst performance and product composition analysis."
"The influence of reaction parameters on characteristics of pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene using a fluidized bed reactor The aim of this study was to produce pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) in a pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor. The influence of various reaction parameters, such as temperature, feed rate and the kind of fluidizing medium, was investigated. The maximum oil yields were about 87wt.% (474°C) for the HIPS and 84wt.% (525°C) for the ABS. A higher feed rate and the use of product gas as a fluidizing medium were favorable for the oil production. The oils produced from the HIPS pyrolysis consisted chiefly of toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, cumene, α-methylstyrene and styrene dimers and they appeared to be usable directly as a fuel or chemical source. Main compounds of the ABS pyrolysis oils were similar to those obtained from the HIPS, except for nitrogen-containing compounds. In the nitrogen mass balance of the ABS pyrolysis products, most of the nitrogen was concentrated in the oil with a content of 6.5–7.1wt.%. The pyrolysis oil from the ABS seemed to require further treatment for its use as a fuel source.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste HIPS and ABS plastics in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Tri-pyrolysis: A thermo-kinetic characterisation of polyethylene, cornstalk, and anthracite coal using TGA-FTIR analysis The tri-pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE ), cornstalk (CS ) and anthracite coal (AC ) was performed using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The pyrolysis and kinetic characteristics of the raw feed materials (PE, CS and AC ) along with selected mass blend ratios was investigated and compared. The tri-pyrolysis process for the selected mass blend ratios is characterised by three distinct stages, which is sequentially dominated by cornstalk CS , polyethylene PE , and anthracite AC . It was found that the activation energies representing the tri-pyrolysis process are different with respect to the activation energies associated with the individual raw feed materials. It is observed that for any given fixed mass blend ratio of PE as the contribution of CS is increased the initial decomposition temperature at which tri-pyrolysis takes place is significantly lowered to <190 °C. Therefore, the increased addition of CS is considered to enhance the tri-pyrolysis process. An increase in the mass blend ratio of AC resulted in higher yields of pyrolysed residue. The yield of tri-pyrolysed residue accounted for up to 40 wt% when the mass blend contribution of AC was ≥0.5. Activation energies of <130 kJ mol−1 for the suite of mass blended materials was determined with little variation in the actual EA’s between the respective mass blend ratios. The tri-pyrolysis reaction is thought to be more stable than the pyrolysis of the individual raw feed materials and it is further suggested that a synergy between the respective feed materials exists during the tri-pyrolysis process.","The study involves lab-scale TGA-FTIR analysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) and other feedstocks, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and activation energies reported."
"Pyrolytic conversion of polyimide into carbon-based CO2 adsorbent with in-situ suppression of toxic byproducts The polymer's physico-chemical property is reinforced by incorporating an aromatic molecule into the polymeric backbone. However, the persistence of aromatic plastics poses potential hazards against the liberation of toxic compounds. To address this issue, this work proposes a functional use of CO2 for the pyrolytic conversion of highly aromatised plastics, polyimide, into carbon-based materials while mitigating the toxic aromatic formations. Characterisations of polyimide clarified its exact type and pyrolysis mechanism. Polyimide pyrolysis yielded ≥ 60 wt.% of the char formation. Its surface functionalities revealed superior performance in CO2 adsorption than the reference materials. However, the production of polyimide-derived adsorbent inevitably generates toxic chemicals. To impede the toxic aromatic formations, CO2 was chosen as a detoxifying agent. The toxic chemicals liberated from polyimide can be converted into gaseous fuel, CO. This functional role of CO2 was improved in the presence of a nickel catalyst. CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis led to a 97.7% degradation in toxic chemicals, subsequently resulting in a 3.14-fold increase in CO formation. Therefore, the CO2-mediated pyrolysis provides insights into the sustainable valorization of aromatic plastic waste into CO2 adsorbent, simultaneously addressing the environmental issues related to the generation of toxic aromatic pollutants.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyimide, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Production of hydrogen and nanocarbon via catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefin over nickel-impregnated coal flyash catalyst The conversion of waste polyolefins into valuable products like hydrogen and nanocarbon offers a promising pathway for waste management and resource recovery. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis using coal flyash (FA) and nickel-impregnated flyash (Ni-FA) as catalysts. Coal flyash, rich in Al2O3 and SiO2, serves as a sustainable and low-cost support for Ni impregnation, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Characterization using TPR, XRD, and FESEM confirmed effective dispersion of Ni on the surface of flyash. The catalysts were then used during pyrolysis of LDPE, HDPE, and PP in a fixed-bed reactor. Ni-FA catalyst yielded 60–75 vol% H2 as compared to 25–60 vol% obtained using FA alone. The nanocarbon structures formed on the Ni-FA catalysts were predominantly multi-walled carbon nanotubes with diameters ranging from 10 to 60 nm, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, and HRTEM. The findings indicate that Ni-FA is a cost-effective and sustainable catalyst, leveraging industrial waste material to address both plastic pollution and the growing demand for H2 and nanocarbon. This study highlights the dual benefit of waste valorization and energy recovery, offering a scalable and environmentally friendly approach for a circular economy. Future research will delve into enhancing the ability of the catalyst by recovering the nanocarbon and regenerating the catalyst for further cycles.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (LDPE, HDPE, PP) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of nanocarbon and hydrogen production."
"Formation mechanism of hydrogen production from catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires: A ReaxFF molecular dynamics and experimental study The mechanism for the formation of gaseous products, especially hydrogen, from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires by using Ni-based catalysts has been studied. The catalytic pyrolysis of the three essential components of waste tires such as natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and cis-polybutadiene rubber (BR) was simulated and the pyrolysis fracture of the molecular chain was investigated. This work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics for the formation mechanisms of gaseous products, primarily hydrogen. Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of the waste tires over Ni-based catalysts was carried out and used to assent to the simulation results. The study revealed that with the incorporation of 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, the relative content of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires can be significantly improved by about 41.3 % in comparison to the same measurement done in the absence of the catalyst. Kinetic and thermodynamic simulations for the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires were also performed and the corresponding energy barriers and Gibbs free energy changes were calculated. Accordingly, the optimal reaction path for the hydrogen production was determined by comparing and analyzing the values of those parameters. It was confirmed that the addition of Ni, ZSM-5, and Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts promote the hydrogen production reaction pathways. Among those catalysts, the simulation result verified that Ni/ZSM-5 brings a pronounced hydrogen production capacity, which was consistent with the experimental findings.","The study involves lab-scale experimental microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic-derived feedstock, with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data."
"TG-FTIR investigations of the pyrolysis of polyurethanes: Quantitative carbon dioxide tracing, decomposition mechanisms, products and mass balances for advanced recycling Polyurethanes (PUR) are versatile polymers used in a broad range of applications. Conventional mechanical recycling is thus difficult. Chemical recycling such as pyrolytic waste treatment presents new recycling options. Advanced recycling by pyrolysis may help to reduce environmental impacts from PUR wastes. The knowledge of mechanisms, products and yields is essential for the design of efficient pyrolysis processes. Rigid (RPUF) and flexible foams (FPUF), a cast elastomer (CE) and a thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) have been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and FTIR-spectroscopy. Two decomposition steps have been identified. CO2 is mainly released in the first decomposition step between 250 °C and 400 °C. The second decomposition step at temperatures above 400 °C releases polyol fragments and marginal amounts of CO2. Strong feedstock dependency is evident. Quantitative tracing for the CO2 release was developed, validated and applied. This allows the resolution of specific decomposition phenomena, mass balancing and distinguishing potentially valuable volatiles from CO2 and solid residues. CO2 yields are 12.0 mass-% for RPUF, 4.0 mass-% for FPUF, 3.2 mass-% for CE and 5.3 mass-% for TPU. Considering solids and CO2 as losses, recycling potentials were determined which are 74 mass-% for RPUF, 90 mass-% for FPUF, 95 mass% for CE and 93 mass-% for TPU. This facilitates further process development based on polymer-specific data.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polyurethanes (RPUF, FPUF, CE, TPU) using TG-FTIR, reports product yields, decomposition mechanisms, and mass balances, including quantifiable CO2 yields and recycling potentials."
"Catalytic co-conversion of Kraft lignin and linear low-density polyethylene over mesoZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15 catalysts Catalytic co-conversion of Kraft lignin (KL) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) over mesostructured catalysts was examined using a micro-pyrolyzer equipped with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (MPy-GC/MS/FID). Mesoporous catalysts of Al-SBA-15 and mesoZSM-5 were synthesized and characterized by N2 sorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption, and X-ray diffraction. The characterization results indicated that mesoZSM-5 had the smaller average pore size (4.10 nm) than Al-SBA-15 (10.70 nm), but its total acidity (both weak and strong acid sites) was much higher than Al-SBA-15. When they were applied as catalysts in the pyrolysis of KL and LLDPE, the mesoZSM-5 exhibited higher catalytic activity for aromatic hydrocarbon production due to its higher acidity and MFI pore structure. Indeed, synergistic synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons was achieved via the catalytic co-pyrolysis of KL and LLDPE because of the H-donating effect of LLDPE; the experimental yields (GC/MS area; abundance vs. time) of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oils obtained from catalytic co-pyrolysis of KL/LLDPE (1:1) over Al-SBA-15 (8.76 × 107) and mesoZSM-5 (27.58 × 107) were ∼1.5 fold higher than the theoretical yields.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic LLDPE with Kraft lignin using mesoporous catalysts, with measurable product yields and analytical characterization of aromatic hydrocarbons."
"Experimental investigation on liquefaction of plastic waste to oil in supercritical water In order to solve the problem of low thermal conductivity and high viscous molten liquid reaction product in the process of plastic liquefaction, the experiments of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) plastic liquefaction were carried out in supercritical water. In this paper, the effects of different operating conditions (temperature, time, feedstock concentration and pressure) on liquid products were studied. It is found that the novel phenomenon that the liquid products of HIPS plastic were mainly toluene and ethylbenzene rather than styrene, which was a product of polystyrene. The experimental results showed that plastic first depolymerized to form styrene and 1,3-diphenylpropane, which were then converted to toluene and ethylbenzene. The increase in temperature promoted this transformation process and some traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons also produced. At 490 °C, the maximum carbon liquefaction rate of 77.0 wt% was obtained, which was 6 times higher than the conventional pyrolysis, and the content of toluene and ethylbenzene were 14 wt% and 51.3 wt%, respectively. Increasing the reaction pressure and prolonging the reaction time all promoted the progress of the plastic liquefaction reaction, while increasing the feedstock concentration caused the carbon liquefaction rate to increase first and then slightly decrease.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste high impact polystyrene (HIPS) in supercritical water, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Solar pyrolysis of waste plastics with photothermal catalysts for high-value products The photothermal catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics has been investigated with bifunctional photo-thermo catalysts in a novel photothermal reaction system. Six kinds of catalysts were introduced and explored in an in-situ fixed-bed reactor under 500 °C heated by solar simulator. The results indicated that the hydrogen production and jet fuel selectivity of Ni-Ti-Al catalyst were 34 mol/kg and 80% respectively, which were significantly higher than 7 mol/kg and 38% of Ti-Al. Catalysts loaded with Ni exhibited strong selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbon, achieving 49.51% for Ni-Al and 53.46% for Ni-Ti-Al especially. In addition, Ni-Ti-Al led to high-quality filamentous carbon tubes in smaller diameter, which presented high thermal stability and graphitization. Bifunctional catalyst, especially Ni-Ti-Al possesses obvious photothermal catalytic performance, which is ascribed to relaxations of photogenerated inter- and intra-band electrons of plasmonic metal Ni and excellent carriers transfer capability of non-plasmonic semiconductor TiO2. The production of hydrogen and jet fuel from plastic by photothermal catalytic pyrolysis provides an environmentally friendly way for high-value-recycling of large amount of the waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste LDPE plastic using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields of hydrogen, jet fuel, and aromatic hydrocarbons, along with catalyst performance and product characterization."
"TG/FTIR study of the thermal pyrolysis of EVA copolymers In this work, the evolution of the gas evolved during the thermal pyrolysis of three commercial ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA) has been studied. The decomposition of the copolymers has been carried out in a thermobalance connected to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) spectrometer through a heated line. The experiments have been performed under N2 atmosphere at several heating rates, and the results obtained showed that, from the quality of the FTIR data obtained, the higher heating rates produced the best results. The evolution of the spectrograms obtained along the pyrolysis process reveals two events of generation of volatile products, related to the stages of EVA decomposition already described in the bibliography. On the other hand, the TG and Gram–Schmidt curves show the existence of two different stages for the second step of the pyrolysis of EVA, which can be associated to the decomposition of the different domains which appear in the polymeric chain after the first decomposition step. The interpretation of the FTIR spectrograms corresponding to the temperatures of maximum decomposition rate for each decomposition step shows the formation of acetic acid, CO and CO2 in the first decomposition step (elimination of the acetoxi groups), and the formation of a complex hydrocarbon mixture in the second decomposition step (cracking of the polymeric chain) including alkanes, alkenes and mononuclear aromatic compounds. The evolution of the ratio of the absorbance of bands at 3015cm−1 (olefinic CH stretching) and 2925cm−1 (asymmetric stretching of CH2 ), representative of the evolution of the ratio 1-alkenes/alkanes, shows a minimum, for the second decomposition step, close to the temperature of maximum decomposition rate, which reflects the differences in the evolution of the alkanes and alkenes in the two stages of the second decomposition step.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of commercial EVA copolymers with measurable product evolution, temperature-dependent decomposition stages, and detailed analytical characterization of gas products via FTIR and TG."
"Tertiary recycling of polypropylene by catalytic cracking in a semibatch stirred reactor Use of spent equilibrium FCC commercial catalyst Catalytic cracking of polypropylene has been carried out in a semibatch stirred reactor. The influence of the nature of the cracking catalyst and the reaction conditions on conversion and selectivity has been studied. Large pore zeolites as well as amorphous and ordered silica–aluminas have been used as catalysts, in order to better study the influence of pore size (micro and meso), crystallite size and the number and strength of the active acid sites. However, it is shown that from a practical point of view, the use of spent equilibrium catalyst from FCC units can be the most adequate solution.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene waste in a lab-scale semibatch stirred reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and reaction condition effects."
"Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene bottles in a packed bed reactor with different bed materials and catalysts Plastic waste is an increasing economic and environmental problem as such there is a great need to process this waste and reduce its environmental impact. In this work, the pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) waste products was investigated using both thermal and catalytic cracking techniques. The experimental work was carried out using packed bed reactor operating under an inert atmosphere at 450°C. Different reactor bed materials, including sand, cement and white clay were used to enhance the thermal cracking of HDPE. In addition, the catalytic effect of sodium hydroxide, HUSY and HBeta zeolite catalysts on the degradation of HDPE waste was also investigated. The reactor beds were found to significantly alter the yield as well as the product composition. Products such as paraffins (⩽C44), olefins (⩽C22), aromatics (⩽C14) and alcohols (C16 and C17) were obtained at varying rates. The highest yield of liquid (82%) was obtained over a cement powder bed with a paraffin yield of 58%. The yield of paraffins and olefins followed separate paths, for paraffins it was found to increase in the order or Cement>White clay>Silica Sand, whereas for the olefins it was in the reverse order Silica Sand>White clay>Cement. The results obtained in this work exhibited a higher P/O ratio than expected, where the amount of generated paraffins was greater than 60% in most cases. Less olefin was generated as a consequence. This indicates that the product generated is more suited to be used as a fuel rather than as a chemical feedstock. The carbon chain length was narrowed to C10–C28 when the zeolitic catalysts were employed, as well as a significant yield of aromatics was obtained mainly naphthalene and d-limonene as an indication that the products obtained are fuel-like products.","The study involves lab-scale thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE in a packed bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Characterization and impact of oxygenates in post-consumer plastic waste-derived pyrolysis oils on steam cracking process efficiency Mechanical recycling of mixed packaging waste has limitations due to challenging separation into pure polyolefin streams which often leads to low quality recyclates. A solution to improve overall recycling rates of polyolefins is chemical recycling. One promising approach is conversion into a liquid product via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking of the pyrolysis oil towards light olefins. In this study, distilled fractions of pyrolysis oils from PE and PP-rich waste were characterized via GC × GC including normal and reversed-phase column configurations with a special focus on oxygenated components. Distilled pyrolysis oils were subsequently steam cracked in 20/80 weight‐based blends with conventional naphtha. All pyrolysis oil samples contained substantial amounts of oxygenates (1–10 wt%) which poses a huge challenge for steam cracker feedstocks and it was found that ketones are the most prevailing oxygenate group. Steam cracking experiments showed slightly increased ethylene yields of the blends compared to pure fossil naphtha, with the PE-derived samples outperforming the PP-derived samples. Furthermore, diesel-range distillation cuts led to higher formation of heavy products compared to the naphtha-range cuts. Increased formation of CO was observed as a consequence of the substantial oxygen contamination which can be a deal-breaker in industrial steam crackers. This work shows that distilled pyrolysis oils with conventional naphtha are promising steam cracking feedstocks if intermediate processing steps are performed to remove the oxygenates and other impurities using, for instance, hydrotreatment. With the findings of this work, such upgrading processes can be designed in a more effective way.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer PE and PP waste, with measurable product yields, detailed characterization of pyrolysis oils, and steam cracking experiments with quantified ethylene yields and byproduct formation."
"Analysis of recycled PET bottles products by pyrolysis-gas chromatography The impact of the contaminants in post used PET bottles on the decomposition of polymer itself after recycling process was analyzed. For that reason sorption experiments of harmful substances to PET bottles were performed. In order to monitor the presence of contaminants in recycled PET and evolution of thermal decomposition products of samples: virgin PET, contaminated PET flakes (PET K) and recycled PET (PET RM) were studied. The thermal degradation products of PET were achieved by pyrolysis using Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), temperature-programmed evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Reactive pyrolysis with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was also performed to gather additional information about degradation products in studied samples. The pyrolysis products analysis of the studied PET samples indicate some changes in decomposition mechanism of PET samples that pass through contamination process due to some diversity in their chemical and structural composition.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PET bottles with measurable product analysis via Py-GC/MS, EGA-MS, and TGA, including yield and decomposition product characterization."
"Production of co-formulants for biodiesel from waste mixtures pyrolysis oil through Fe-based catalysts This study investigates new developments of thermal catalytic pyrolysis using transition metals (Fe2+, Fe3+) supported on ZSM-5 zeolites applied to a feedstock originated from the food court areas which can be considered representative for Municipal Solid Waste(MSW).The catalytic pyrolysis runs were performed using a two-stage process configuration: thermal pyrolysis conducted at 500 °C followed by catalytic cracking of vapors. The vapor catalytic upgrading was done ex-situ by using three types of catalysts HZSM5, Fe2+HZSM5, and Fe3+HZSM5 at 300, 350, and 400 °C. The structural features inherent of the ZSM-5 zeolites and associated properties (e.g. very regular microporosity, stability, ion exchange capacity) during pyrolytic processes, as well as the ability to accommodate chemical modification via isomorphic substitution of the tetrahedral atoms in the crystal network in presence of transition metals, make them unique catalysts scavengers. This new route can be applied to target the pyrolytic process for Food Court Waste (FCW) selective conversion and obtaining valuable intermediaries for different industries. The addition of catalysts was shown to enhance FCW decomposition at lower temperatures. The most important result observed in the pyrolysis process was obtained over Fe2+ZSM- 5 which was found to be the most efficient catalyst for waste minimization leading to high bio-oil conversion (∼40 wt% at 350 °C). The catalytic pyrolysis process of FCW provides resources for specific transformations, in target raw materials, products additives or co-formulants for biofuel manufacture or upgrading.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic-rich food court waste (representative of municipal solid waste) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and temperature-dependent results."
"Jet fuel range hydrocarbon generation from catalytic pyrolysis of lignin and polypropylene with iron-modified activated carbon In this study, iron was used to modify pyrolytic activated carbon (AC) to synthesize a bifunctional catalyst (Fe/AC). It was applied to the catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin with polypropylene (PP) for the preparation of jet fuel range hydrocarbons. Relationships between iron loading, reaction temperature, catalyst/feedstock ratio, and lignin/PP ratio were investigated in connection to the yield, component distribution, carbon number distribution, and chain structure of pyrolysis products. The results indicated that the hydrocarbons with carbon numbers in the jet fuel range dominated the products obtained from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin and polypropylene. Owing to the oxytropism of Fe3 + , the selectivity of oxygenated chemicals in pyrolysis oil decreased as the Fe loading rose. Consequently, the production of hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range was increased. Furthermore, the deoxygenation and alkylation reactions of phenols to high-carbon aromatics were facilitated by Fe3 + . The cyclization and dehydrogenation reactions were promoted with the reaction temperature increased, thus enhancing the selectivity of cyclic hydrocarbons (cycloalkanes and aromatics) in the jet fuel range. However, secondary reactions were boosted with the excessive temperature, reducing the yield of hydrocarbons and the percentage of high-carbon hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range. The reduction of the proportion of oxygenated compounds was facilitated by the use of catalysts. Thus, the selectivity of hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range was improved, but the yield of high-carbon hydrocarbons would be reduced. In addition, the cleavage of PP-derived chain hydrocarbons was promoted by the hydrogen abstraction reaction of lignin-derived oxygenates during co-pyrolysis. The hydrogen transfer reaction between hydrocarbons and phenols was enhanced, it was pushed for phenols to convert to aromatics. Thus, the yield of hydrocarbons in the range of jet fuel was improved. A new approach to the efficient application of lignin with PP might be offered by the current work.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) and lignin, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under varying reaction conditions."
"Conventional and fast pyrolysis of automobile shredder residues (ASR) This work aims at comparing performance and product yields in conventional pyrolysis and fast pyrolysis of automotive shredded residues. In both processes, carbon conversion to gaseous and liquid products was more than 80%. Gas production was maximised in conventional pyrolysis (about 35% by weight of the initial ASR weight), while fast pyrolysis led to an oil yield higher than 55%. Higher heating values (HHV) of both conventional pyrolysis gas and fast pyrolysis oil increased from 8.8 to 25.07 MJ/Nm3 and from 28.8 and 36.27 MJ/kg with increasing pyrolysis temperature.","The study involves pyrolysis of automobile shredder residues, a form of mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and fuel properties reported."

A liquid yield of 66% in an inert environment was achieved without the formation of coke and gas by-products. An exposure time of 90min. and a catalyst loading of 200mg were considered as an optimum conditions to minimize the styrene re-polymerization.

"Upcycling of polyurethane into iron-nitrogen-carbon electrocatalysts active for oxygen reduction reaction World plastic production has increased since industrial-scale production began in the 1940s and while large amount of thermoplastic polymers can be effectively recycled and re-used, undifferentiated polymers or thermoset polymers cannot, and as a result, most of these raw materials end up in landfill or energy recovery in incinerators. The synthesis of carbon nanomaterials from conversion of waste polymers is an alternative, promising approach owing to the high added-value of these products. In particular, novel carbon materials, could translate into interesting and cheap material for the catalytic reduction of oxygen (ORR), a fundamental reaction for the production of H2O2 or in fuel cell and metal air batteries. This paper presents the synthesis of iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe-N-C) electrocatalysts starting from a mix of polyethylene (PE) and polyurethane (PU) by adding FeCl3 as an iron source for promoting Fe-Nx sites formation. The two polymers were mixed according to a solvent assisted process employing p-xylene or with a solvent free process using a Brabender plastograph. The blend of thermoplastic and thermoset polymers was converted into Fe-N-C materials in a two-step pyrolysis, where the temperature of second pyrolysis showed to sensitively affect the chemical and textural properties of the resulting material. Depending on the temperature, and initial PE content, the surface area ranges between 195 and 479 m2 g−1, with a preferential formation of micropores. XPS analysis confirmed that the employment of PU leads to the formation of nitrogen functional groups and Fe-Nx sites, while XRD investigation in heating chamber allowed to follow the formation Fe3C, Fe2O3, γ-Fe and α-Fe with temperature rises between 700–1000°C. The new Fe-N-C catalysts were characterized by linear sweep voltammetry at ring disk electrode showing interesting activity for the ORR in both acid and alkaline electrolyte and a selectivity for H2O2 which deeply depends on the type of electrolyte as well as on nitrogen content and on the surface area of the samples.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyurethane and polyethylene waste plastics to produce Fe-N-C electrocatalysts, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent properties, and analytical characterization including XPS, XRD, and electrochemical testing."
"Catalytic cracking of polyethylene over zeolite mordenite with enhanced textural properties Catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using different samples of mordenite zeolite as catalyst. In order to obtain materials with different textural properties, a new synthesis method based on the functionalization of the zeolite seeds with an organosilane was employed. Mordenite samples with BET and external surface areas in the range 385–485 and 9–57m2/g, respectively, were prepared. LDPE catalytic cracking reactions were performed at 420°C for 2h in a batch reactor provided with a screw stirrer under a continuous nitrogen flow. Thermal cracking of LDPE leads to plastic conversion lower than 30%, while values of 40% are reached when traditional mordenite is used as catalyst. In contrast, when mordenite samples with enhanced textural properties were employed, a plastic conversion of 60% is attained, both gas (C1–C5) and gasoline (C6–C12) fractions being obtained as main products. On the contrary, gasoline fraction is not observed and a heavier hydrocarbon fraction in the range C13–C35 is detected when thermal cracking or even catalytic cracking over traditional mordenite samples are carried out. The formation of lighter hydrocarbon products (C6–C12) over mordenite samples with enhanced textural properties is assigned to the higher activity and accessibility of their acid sites, which promotes both end-chain and random scission cracking reactions of the polymer molecules.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Obtainment of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites by alkaline treatment for the polyethylene catalytic cracking Great efforts have been applied in order to achieve the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites through post-synthesis alkaline treatment. In this case, the use of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites as acid catalysts in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins overcomes some diffusional limitations and expands the selectivity of products. Thus, the purpose of work was to promote a secondary porosity in ZSM-5 zeolite by NaOH treatment (using conventional electric and microwave heating methods), applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as pore-directing agent. Both heating methods generated additional secondary porosity, with microwave heating promoting a narrow pore size distribution, when compared to conventional. All hierarchical ZSM-5 have been showed low-density polyethylene conversions superior to the purely microporous ZSM-5, however the hierarchical zeolite processed by conventional electric heating reached the higher temperature reduction (42.6 K). It was evidenced through measurements of morphological and textural properties, ion exchange capacity and catalytic activity in the LDPE cracking that the CTAB cations exerts a protective effect at alkaline treatment avoiding the desilication process. The additional secondary porosity promoting the generation of compounds of lower molecular mass in LDPE catalytic cracking, by thermogravimetric analysis, proving that the alkaline treatment increases the accessibility to the active acidic sites of zeolitic catalysts for bulky molecules.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of textural and morphological properties."
"HDPE chemical recycling promoted by phenol solvent The thermal cracking of HDPE in the presence of different amounts of phenol has been studied and compared with the reaction carried out without this solvent. HDPE conversion is enhanced with the amount of solvent, reaching a value of nearly 100% using a 1/10 HDPE/phenol ratio. The yield of the gaseous hydrocarbons also rose with the amount of phenol, olefins being the main products in this fraction. In all reactions, the main products of the C5–C32 fraction were linear hydrocarbons such as n-paraffins and α-olefins. The yields of both hydrocarbons increased in line with the amount of phenol. However, the increase was more significant in the case of α-olefins. All these results indicate that the phenol promotes the plastic degradation, enhancing the HDPE conversion and facilitating the formation of specific products. A reaction mechanism is proposed to explain these results, indicating random scissions and chain reactions which are favoured by the presence of this solvent during the HDPE thermal degradation.","The study involves lab-scale thermal cracking of HDPE (a waste plastic) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis, demonstrating experimental data from a solvent-assisted pyrolysis process."
"Study on the synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis between chicken manure biogas residue and low-density polyethylene The synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis between chicken manure biogas residue (CMBR) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was revealed. The weight loss and kinetics during co-pyrolysis were characterized using a synchronous thermal analyzer. The effects of mixing ratio and pyrolysis temperature on the characteristics of the three-phase products of co-pyrolysis were analyzed using a tube furnace. The results demonstrated an increase in mass loss rate (M f) and comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) and a reduction in activation energy compared to theoretical calculations, confirming the presence of synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis between the two materials. Positive synergistic effect was the most pronounced at the mixing ratio of 1:1. Co-pyrolysis inhibited bio-oil production and reduced the O/C ratio of bio-oil; it also precipitated the release of pyrolysis gas and increased the yields of CH4 and hydrocarbon gas (CnHm). Co-pyrolysis reduced the content of nitrogenated organic compounds in bio-char, enhanced its aromaticity and altered the pore structure on the bio-char surface. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, co-pyrolysis bio-oil further transformed into small-molecule gases, leading to an increase in the yields of CO and H2.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, using a tube furnace with measurable product yields and analytical characterization of products and kinetics."
"Co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and plastics: A comprehensive study on pyrolysis kinetics and characteristics Co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastics is an interesting research trend in improving both the yield and quality of oil products toward taking advantage of flexible material resources and sustainable fuel development. This study investigated the kinetic behaviors using thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis characterization for the co-pyrolysis of biomass (bamboo and oak wood) with plastics (polypropylene [PP] and polystyrene [PS]) in a fixed-bed reactor. The kinetic triplet for feedstocks was determined using the isoconversional method, compensation effect, and master plot method. The addition of 20 wt% plastics into biomass decreased the activation energy, with the most distinct positive synergistic effect for the bamboo/PS blend. In addition, the effect of co-pyrolysis temperature and biomass/plastic ratio on pyrolysis characteristics was investigated. Through biomass pyrolysis and biomass/plastic co-pyrolysis, the positive changes in distributions and physical-chemical properties of the products (i.e., char, oil, and gas) were observed using various analytical methods. Especially in the case of biomass/PS blends, the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis was shown due to the difference in the actual and theoretical yields of the products. The liquid yields of the co-pyrolysis were 50.95, 50.17, 55.15, and 56.16 wt% for bamboo/PP, bamboo/PS, oak wood/PP, and oak wood/PS, respectively. The highest HHV of 28.22 MJ/kg was obtained for oil derived from the co-pyrolysis of bamboo/PS. Furthermore, co-pyrolysis chars have high HHVs in the range of 30.73–32.41 MJ/kg, suggesting that they can be used as solid fuels.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PS) with lignocellulosic biomass, reports measurable product yields, and includes experimental characterization of oil, char, and gas properties."
"3D meso/macroporous carbon from MgO-templated pyrolysis of waste plastic as an efficient electrode for supercapacitors Converting waste plastic into valuable carbon materials as the electrode for supercapacitors represents a sustainable way to deal with the severe waste plastic-related environmental issues. However, ideal carbon materials for supercapacitors require not only a large specific surface area but also abundant meso/macropores, which is still challenging for conventional synthesis methods. Herein, MgO-templated pyrolysis with chemical activation was demonstrated as an effective approach to convert waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles into 3D meso/macroporous carbon (MMPC) with both large total surface area (1863.55 m2/g) and meso/macropore surface area (1478.46 m2/g). Furthermore, it exhibited a high capacitance of 191.4 F/g and an excellent rate capability (86.3% retention from 0.5 to 10 A/g) for supercapacitor. This work provides not only a facile approach to synthesize 3D meso/macroporous carbon materials but also a sustainable way to mitigate plastic-derived pollution.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PET plastic using MgO templating to produce 3D meso/macroporous carbon, with measurable yields, surface area, and electrochemical performance data."
"Production of hydrogen-rich fuel gas from waste plastics using continuous plasma pyrolysis reactor There is a serious concern about the large amount of accumulated plastic waste all around the world. Synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE) are substantially present in the plastic waste generated. There are various methods reported to minimise such plastics waste with certain limitations. To overcome such limitations the present study have been carried out in which thermal decomposition of plastic waste of PET, PP, HDPE, and LDPE studied using a novel plasma pyrolysis reactor. The major objective of this work is to investigate the viability of the continuous plasma pyrolysis process for the treatment of various plastic wastes with respect to waste volume reduction and production of combustible hydrogen-rich fuel gas. The effect of temperature and feed flow rate on product gas yield, product gas efficiency, solid residue yield, and H2/CO ratio has been evaluated. The experiments have been carried out at different temperatures within the range of 700–1000 °C. Plasma pyrolysis system exhibited combustible hydrogen-rich gas as a product and solid residue. Liquid products have not been observed during plasma pyrolysis, unlike conventional pyrolysis. The reaction mechanism of plastic cracking has been discussed based on literature and products obtained in the present work. The effects of feed flow rate and temperature on exergy efficiency were studied using the response surface method. The mass, energy, and exergy analyses have also been carried out for all the experiments, which are in the range of 0.95–0.99, 0.48 to 0.77, and 0.30 to 0.69, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (PET, PP, HDPE, LDPE) in a continuous plasma reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of gas composition and efficiency."
"Pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste: Predicting the product yields The predictability of pyrolysis yields and product composition of mixed plastics has been studied. To do so, pyrolysis of virgin polymers (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS and PET) and eight individual sorting categories from a real waste DKR-350 stream (PE rigid/film, PP rigid/film, PET, PS, multilayer flexibles, and clogged materials) was performed in a batch reactor at 500 °C at laboratory scale. The obtained oil/wax, gas, and solid yields and the composition of oil/wax of those individual feedstocks were used as input of a superposition model to predict the corresponding pyrolysis yields and oil/wax composition of mixed feeds, which were later compared with the experimentally measured product yields from the pyrolysis of those mixed streams. This linear model predicts the oil/wax yield of the mixed streams to a reasonable extent, with a maximum yield deviation (overestimation) of 8 percentage points. However, the presence of significant amounts of PET (above 33 wt%) in the mixed plastic streams negatively impacts the production of the condensable product and promotes the formation of solid products beyond the expected predicted values. Quantification of the type of carbon (aliphatic, aromatic and carbonyl) present in all the oil/wax products was done using 13C NMR spectroscopy. A linear model could also predict the aliphatic carbon yield in the condensable product from plastic waste streams with high accuracy (maximum yield difference of 6 percentage points). However, the aromatic carbon yield could not be predicted, probably due to the observed behavior of PET, which interacts with other polymers to promote solid product formation.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET, and mixed plastic streams) with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and experimental characterization using 13C NMR and batch reactor conditions."
"Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of ironbark sawdust and plastic waste over strontium loaded hierarchical Y-zeolite The objective of this research is to synthesize hierarchical strontium loaded Y-zeolite and study its application for ironbark (IB) and plastic waste (PW) co-pyrolysis. Commercial parent Y-zeolite (Si/Al = 2.48) was modified via sequential dealumination-desilication using citric acid and NaOH. Further, strontium (8 wt %) was loaded into the modified Y-zeolite via wet and dry impregnation methods. The prepared catalyst was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isothermal, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) combined with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). After dealumination (treatment using 0.1 M of citric acid), the external surface area and Si/Al ratio increased from 53.5 to 147.4 m2/g and 2.48 to 5.36, respectively. However, the sequential desilication treatment reduced Si/Al ratio from 5.36 to 2.57. In addition, Y-zeolite enhanced the total aromatic percentage and reduced the acidic group in co-pyrolysis oil.","The study involves lab-scale thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and biomass using a synthesized catalyst, with measurable product characterization and experimental data on catalyst performance and oil composition."
"Evaluating sustainable biofuel production from Biomass-Plastic Co-Pyrolysis: Insights into PAHs formation and Bio-Oil yield This study investigates the influence of key process parameters on the formation and distribution of 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in bio-oil derived from the co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and bagasse. A custom-designed pilot-scale auger pyrolysis reactor was used to analyze various feedstock compositions, including pure LDPE, 33 % bagasse-67 % LDPE, 67 % bagasse-33 % LDPE, and pure bagasse, across a temperature range of 450 °C, 525 °C, 600 °C, and 675 °C, as well as auger speeds of 2, 6, and 10 rpm, reflecting different residence times. The results indicated that higher temperatures and longer residence times promoted the formation of high-molecular-weight PAHs. The optimal bio-oil yield was achieved at 600 °C with a 67 %-LDPE mixture at 2 rpm, yielding up to 48.12 % with a total PAH concentration of 5853 mg/L. Meanwhile, the 67 %-bagasse mixture, with a bio-oil yield of 43.90 % at 525 °C and 2 rpm, showed the lowest total PAH content at 1518 mg/L. These findings elucidate the synergistic effects of feedstock composition and operational parameters on PAH formation, emphasizing the need for precise control of pyrolysis conditions to optimize bio-oil yield while minimizing harmful PAH content. This research contributes to the development of cleaner and safer biofuel technologies.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) and biomass (bagasse) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Thermal behavior and products characteristics during furfural residue co-pyrolysis with waste plastic Furfural residue (FR) is a biomass waste generated during furfural production, while waste plastic is a common type of organic solid waste. In this study, co-pyrolysis of FR and polypropylene (PP) was carried out to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperature, waste plastic mixing ratio and in-situ catalyst on product properties. It was shown that an increase in the plastic mixing ratio significantly affected the composition of gas and liquid products, with a decrease in oxygenated compounds and an increase in hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil. The CnHm content in pyrolysis gas increased. The hydroxyl (O-H) content in pyrolysis char decreases, and the specific surface area decreases from 375.235 m2/g to 269.569 m2/g. The largest increase in olefin content in oil is achieved at a plastic ratio of 0.6. As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the formation of hydrocarbons is promoted, and the content reaches 55.92 % at 500oC. Aromatic yield (37.5 %) and H2 yield (12.07 %) were highest with the addition of ZSM-5 catalyst, while alkane yield (24.89 %) and CO yield (15.78 %) were highest with MgO catalyst. The acid and ester content of pyrolysis oil decreased while the hydrocarbon content increased when CaO catalyst was used.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (PP) with biomass residue, reports measurable product yields and composition changes, and includes experimental data on temperature, catalyst effects, and product analysis."
"Pyrolysis of mixed plastic fractions – Development of predictive models for yield and oil quality Pyrolysis of plastic mixtures has shown to form complex mixtures of oil, which is difficult to predict. Interaction effects between plastics have shown to affect both the oil composition and the yield distribution of oil, char, and gas. This work aims to generate models for the prediction of oil and char yield, acid number, and viscosity based on the feed composition. Besides the oil composition based on the reactor feed was mapped. Pyrolysis was performed in a batch reactor with a mixture of PP, PE, EVA, PET, PS and PA, where the content of PET, PS and PA were varied from 0% to 15%. The developed models showed a decrease in oil yield of 10% when 15% PS was interchanged with PET. Char content, acid number, and viscosity were shown to increase with the content of PET and lowered with the content of PS. PA caused an increase in char yield and viscosity, while it did not affect the acid number. The models R2-values varied from 0.87 to 0.96, showing that most of the variation in the responses can be explained by the differences in feed composition. The oil composition was found to mainly consist of hydrocarbons (C10 +), naphta and aromatics with only a small precense of alcohol and acid. The content of aromatic hydrocarbons is increased by the presence of PS, due to formation of styrene and toluene while the acid content increases with the PET content.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PP, PE, EVA, PET, PS, PA) with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions, demonstrating experimental data on oil, char, and gas yields, as well as oil quality parameters."
"Conversion of polyethylene waste to short chain hydrocarbons under mild temperature and hydrogen pressure with metal-free and metal-loaded MFI zeolites Catalytic hydrocracking on supported metal zeolites promisingly converts waste plastics into more valuable hydrocarbons. Although the presence of metal sites on solid acids is typically considered necessary for C-C bond cleavage of alkanes at modest temperatures, we show that polyethylene (PE) depolymerization on metal-free MFI zeolites proceeds at higher rates than analogous metal-loaded MFI zeolites (Pt, Ni) under mild reaction conditions. Higher rates on metal-free MFI are consistent with higher ratios of alkenes to alkanes, leading to subsequent alkene-mediated beta-scission events that form smaller molecules. Under varied reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, H2 versus N2), both metal-free and metal-loaded MFI catalysts demonstrate high selectivity to C3-C7 gaseous hydrocarbons, likely due to the 10-MR channel structure. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of deconvoluting metal and acid sites contributions for PE hydrocracking, which has significant implications on rates and product selectivities of plastic upcycling reactions.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene waste using metal-free and metal-loaded MFI zeolites under controlled temperature and hydrogen pressure, with measurable product yields and selectivity to C3-C7 hydrocarbons."
Thermal degradation of PE and PS mixed with ABS-Br and debromination of pyrolysis oil by Fe- and Ca-based catalysts Polymer mixtures containing 8g of high density polyethylene (PE) or polystyrene (PS) and 2g of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer containing a polybrominated epoxy type flame retardant (ABS-Br) were thermally degraded at 450°C. FeOOH and two carbon composites based on iron (Fe-C) and calcium (Ca-C) were used for catalytic decomposition and their effect on the bromine and nitrogen amount and distribution in pyrolysis oil was determined by GC-AED analysis. It was found that iron-based catalysts removed bromine from pyrolysis oil and decreased the nitrogen amount converting nitrile compounds into ammonia. Calcium carbon composite had lower effect especially on the pyrolysis of PS/ABS-Br mixture. These liquid products can be used as fuel oil or feedstock in petroleum refinery.,"The study involves lab-scale thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of waste plastics (PE, PS, ABS-Br) with measurable product analysis, catalyst performance evaluation, and yield-related characterization."
"Synergistic effects and comprehensive analysis of interaction during infrared co-pyrolysis of furfural residues and PVC Infrared co-pyrolysis was employed to convert waste into valuable resource due to the increasing production of plastic waste. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) accurately predicted PVC and furfural residues thermal behavior. The results showed high accuracy (R2 > 0.95) after the SVM model was trained and validated. Furthermore, this research performed an in-depth characterized of the co-pyrolysis process using various analytical techniques, indicting TG-FTIR-GC/MS, XPS, simulated distillation, and GC/MS. As the temperatures and heating rates increased, the pyrolysis oil yield increased at first and then declined, reaching a maximum of 37.7 % at 600 °C and 10 °C/s. Notably, aromatic content was relatively high, comparing with other components, whereas the chlorinated content remained relatively low, all below 6.5 %, indicating the pyrolysis oil quality had effectively improved. According to the results of XPS, there was a significant 64.11 % increase in inorganic chlorination, which suggested the effective reduction in gaseous chlorine emission and achieving chlorine immobilization.","The study involves lab-scale infrared co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVC) and furfural residues, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent performance, and detailed analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"A comparative study on co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride: Synergistic effects and product characteristics Co-pyrolysis of waste biomass and plastics was investigated to find out whether the quality of pyrolysis products was improved. For the sake of yield and compositional comparison, three polymers (polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride) and two biomasses (walnut shells and peach stones) were tested in a fixed bed reactor. The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at 500 °C as 20.81 wt % for walnut shell and 18.30 wt %, for peach stone pyrolysis, then co-pyrolysis experiments were performed at 500 °C. Based on the experimental findings, blending of polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride into biomass affected product yield substantially. To gain more insight into the effect of polymers, liquid and solid products were analyzed by various analytical techniques. Results showed a significant modification on the chemical structure tars after co-pyrolysis, and tar yield increased up to 49.80 wt%. Meanwhile, modifying the structures and enhancing the quality of the tars and chars seemed possible by co-pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (PET, PS, PVC) with biomass, reporting measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"An experimental investigation on performance, emission and combustion characteristics of IC engine using liquid fuel produced through catalytic co-pyrolysis of pressed oil cake and mixed plastics with the addition of nanoparticles The study focuses on using a combination of diesel and a liquid fuel derived from the co-pyrolysis of pressed neem cake (PNC) and mixed waste plastics (MWP) containing waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) in equal amounts with the help of cupric oxide (CuO) catalyst. The engine analysis was carried out using diesel and five different blends of co-pyrolysis oil with diesel in proportions of 20 % (20 % pyrolysis oil + 80 % diesel = PD20), 40 % (PD40), 50 % (PD50) and 100 % pyrolysis oil (PD100), respectively. Initially, the co-pyrolysis oil was produced using PNC and MWP in a ratio of 1:2 under different operating temperatures between 350 °C and 650 °C. The process temperature was optimized to yield maximum liquid oil, and the characterization study was performed. In addition to that, CeO2 nanoadditives were used to improve the properties of PD20 fuel. Different dosages of nanoadditives were blended with PD20 to prepare PD20@25 (PD20 + 25 ppm CeO2), PD20@50, PD20@75, and PD20@100. The objective of the study is to assess the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine utilizing co-pyrolysis oil-diesel blend by including the nanoadditives. The analysis was carried out on a single-cylinder water-cooled diesel engine mounted with an eddy current dynamometer. The experiments demonstrated that the combination of PD20 and 50 ppm CeO2 resulted in a 6 % increase in thermal efficiency when compared to other blended fuels and diesel. When compared to all fuels, the PD20@50 produced a higher decrease in CO and HC emissions by roughly 30 and 6.2 %, respectively. The combustion analysis showed that the heat release rate (HRR) and maximum cylinder pressure were also found to have improved by adding nanoparticles.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PET and LDPE) with pressed oil cake, including measurable product yields, temperature optimization, catalyst performance, and engine test results with quantified emissions and efficiency data."
"Role of pore structure in the deactivation of zeolites (HZSM-5, Hβ and HY) by coke in the pyrolysis of polyethylene in a conical spouted bed reactor The deactivation of three different catalysts used in the cracking of high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been compared. The catalysts used are HZSM-5, Hβ and HY zeolites agglomerated with bentonite and alumina. The reactions have been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500°C, and plastic (high density polyethylene) has been fed in continuous mode (1gmin−1) for up to 15h of reaction. The HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst gives way to high yields of C2–C4 olefins (57wt%) and, moreover, it is the one least influenced by deactivation throughout the run, which is explained by the lower deterioration of its physical properties and acidity. The results of temperature program combustion and transmission electron microscopy show that coke growth is hindered in the HZSM-5 zeolite pore structure. The high N2 flow rate used in the conical spouted bed reactor enhances coke precursor circulation towards the outside of the zeolite crystal channels.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of coke deposition and pore structure effects."
"Simultaneous removal of brominated and chlorinated species during the production of oils by e-waste plastics catalytic hydropyrolysis The production of added-value chemicals via pyrolysis of plastic wastes, such as those from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), needs addressing their usual contamination with halogens (mainly Br and Cl). This work compares the conversion via pyrolysis and hydropyrolysis of a real WEEE plastic, having a complex composition, in two different reactor configurations: down-flow (DF) and up-flow (UF). Likewise, the effects of incorporating a Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and using two different pressures (1 and 6 bar) have been assessed. With the DF mode, pyrolysis at 1 bar leads to an oil yield above 80 wt% and a total halogen content of about 600 ppm (vs 1600 ppm in the water-washed WEEE plastic). Under DF catalytic hydropyrolysis at 6 bar, this high oil yield is maintained while its dehalogenation degree is improved (142 ppm). Operating with the up-flow configuration, under 6 bar and H2 presence, leads to some reduction in the oil yield (about 70 wt%) but significantly decreases the oil halogen content (55 ppm Cl and total elimination of Br). These results have been related to the slower pyrolysis and longer residence time in the thermal zone of the UF configuration, which favours the halogen-trapping effect of the char fraction, and the pressure-enhanced hydrodehalogenation activity of the catalyst. This study highlights the environmental benefits of the proposed process, emphasizing the lower halogen content in the resulting oils and promoting a more sustainable approach to plastic waste valorisation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic hydropyrolysis of real e-waste plastic waste with measurable product yields, halogen content reduction, and reactor condition analysis."
"Transforming a mixture of real post-consumer plastic waste into activated carbon for biogas upgrading Plastic waste management is a current environmental issue that demands potential solutions since complete mechanical recycling is limited to the complexity and feasibility regarding the quality and purity of plastic waste. Pyrolysis has emerged as a reasonable solution for the recycling of those fractions that are not further suitable for recycling. Although the implementation of this technology is mature, the generated solid fraction or char has not been completely inserted in the closed loop of plastic recycling. This work explores the possibility of using the carbonaceous char as a precursor for the preparation of porous activated carbons for environmental application as CO2 adsorbent and biogas upgrading. The effect of the pyrolysis temperature (450 or 500 ºC) on the obtained chars has been assessed for the benefits in the second stage of chemical activation, exploring the possibility of the use of diverse chemical agents. The composition, textural, and surface properties of the porous materials were characterized. N2 isotherms showed that the char prepared at 500 ºC provided the best textural properties with a performance of K2CO3 ∼ KOH > Na2CO3 > NaOH > ZnCl2 > FeCl3. Isotherms of CO2 adsorption showed that the activation with K2CO3 displayed the best uptake (130.2 mg g−1 at 273 K), closely followed by KOH (125.0 mg g−1 at 273 K), also confirmed by dynamic tests in a fixed bed column configuration. The uptake was well correlated with the ultramicropore volume and the oxygenated functional groups. The CO2 and CH4 adsorption were studied either in static or dynamic assays. The behavior of the sample activated with K2CO3 was studied in detail in column tests, suggesting that the activated material exhibits promising behavior for biogas upgrading.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real post-consumer plastic waste at specific temperatures (450 or 500 °C) to produce char, followed by experimental characterization and measurable product yields and performance data for CO2 adsorption and biogas upgrading."
"A novel approach of solid waste management via aromatization using multiphase catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene A new and innovative approach was adopted to increase the yield of aromatics like, benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) in the catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE). The BTX content was significantly increased due to effective interaction between catalystZSM-5 and target molecules i.e., lower paraffins within the reactor. The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis both were performed in a specially designed semi-batch reactor at the temperature range of 500 °C–800 °C. Catalytic pyrolysis were performed in three different phases within the reactor batch by batch systematically, keeping the catalyst in A type- vapor phase, B type- liquid phase and C type- vapor and liquid phase (multiphase), respectively. Total aromatics (BTX) of 6.54 wt% was obtained for thermal pyrolysis at a temperature of 700 °C. In contrary, for the catalytic pyrolysis A, B and C types reactor arrangement, the aromatic (BTX) contents were progressively increased, nearly 6 times from 6.54 wt% (thermal pyrolysis) to 35.06 wt% for C-type/multiphase (liquid and vapor phase). The pyrolysis oil were characterized using GC-FID, FT-IR, ASTM distillation and carbon residue test to evaluate its end use and aromatic content.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene in a semi-batch reactor with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product characterization using GC-FID, FT-IR, and other analytical methods."
"Complex microstructural evolution in high temperature pyrolysis of plastic and biomass Pyrolytic carbon with controlled pore structure and high surface area from produced from recycled carbonaceous materials like biomass and plastics have significant applications such as solid fuel for power plants and reductants for metallurgical process. Understanding the detailed pathways of carbon structural evolution, yields insights into the effect of temperature on chemical and physical properties and is expected to yield efficiencies in the synthesis of these heat treated carbonaceous materials. While the effect of heat treatment temperature in determining the texture, pore size, and chemical structure of pyrolytic carbon has been well studied, the influence of precursor structure and mineral content is less understood. In the present work, the differences in structural evolution during pyrolysis using fixed bed reactors, of biomass and plastics, or between biomass with different ash contents have been studied. An in depth measurement of the resulting pyrolytic carbon in the range of 600 ℃ to 1500 ℃, using Raman spectroscopy, XRD, surface area measurement, yield a detailed understanding of the structural evolution of char. The difference in characteristics between chars from biomass and plastics is shown to arise due to distinct structural evolution in the early stages of the pyrolysis while the presence of different alkali oxides in the chars influences the char characteristics at higher temperatures (>1000 ℃) via a metal ion intercalation mechanism. These structural changes are directly related to changes in the measured gasification reaction of the chars.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of plastic and biomass feedstocks, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent structural evolution, and experimental characterization using Raman spectroscopy, XRD, and surface area analysis."
"Modulating local environment of Ni with W for synthesis of carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from plastics The strategy of thermochemical conversion of plastic waste into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen makes both environmental and economic sense. Exploring high-performance catalysts is an essential prerequisite of converting plastics by pyrolysis and in-line catalysis technology. To improve the catalytic performance of Ni–Mg system, high-valency and refractory tungsten as a promoter was introduced. A series of W–Ni–Mg oxides with various W/Ni atomic ratios (0, 1/15, 1/7, 1/3) were synthesized and their catalytic performances were evaluated. The sample with W/Ni atomic ratio of 1/7 exhibited the mixed phase of MgNiO2 and MgWO4 and showed the highest yields of CNTs and hydrogen. Furthermore, the effect of tungsten on the modulating the local coordination and electronic structure of active Ni was explored. The addition of tungsten facilitated the reduction of Ni and maintained it as solid state, not traditional quasi-liquid state, to alleviate the aggregation and migration of Ni nanoparticles. Thus, the CNT growth over W–Ni–Mg oxide sample predominantly followed vapor−solid−solid mechanism, while vapor−liquid−solid mechanism could still occur as the secondary growth of CNTs.","The study involves pyrolysis of plastic waste using Ni–Mg and W–Ni–Mg oxide catalysts, with measured yields of carbon nanotubes and hydrogen, and detailed characterization of catalysts and reaction mechanisms."
"Synergistic recovery of renewable hydrocarbon resources via microwave co-pyrolysis of biomass residue and plastic waste over spent toner catalyst towards sustainable solid waste management The present study unveiled the effect of operating temperature, blending ratio and catalyst addition on the product distribution during microwave co-pyrolysis of Hydnocarpus de-oiled seed cake (HDSC) and Waste electrical and electronic plastic (WEEP). In this work, a new approach of “treatment of wastes with waste” was proposed by converting spent toner powder into a low-cost catalyst. Initially, co-pyrolysis process was conducted in which the operating temperature were changed to 450, 500, and 550 °C corresponding to HDSC:WEEP mixture ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100. The result shows that oil phase yield was significantly higher for 50:50 mixture ratio and this condition further selected for addition of catalyst. The catalytic co-pyrolysis result shows that produced oil have a density of 0.862 g/mL, high calorific value of 39.51 MJ/kg and viscosity 2.71 cSt which is comparable to commercial diesel fuel. The GC-MS study discovered that addition of catalyst could significantly suppress the oxygen and nitrogen compounds while promote the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons through Diels-Alder reaction mechanism. Finally, techno economic analysis revealed that 1000 kg/h plant demonstrated to be economically viable, with minimal production cost (USD 0.53/L compared to USD 1.15/L of commercial diesel fuel price in India).","The study involves lab-scale microwave co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (WEEP) and biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Recycling of plastic-rich streams from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) sorting plants: An in-depth study of pyrolysis potential through product characterization and life cycle assessment (LCA) Thermochemical recycling is emerging as a viable alternative for the recycling of complex plastic waste streams, such as those originated in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) sorting facilities. In this work, three different WEEE plastic-rich samples are subjected to pyrolysis and the resulting products are thoroughly analyzed to assess their potential industrial utilization. The pyrolysis processes are conducted in a 3 L non-stirred tank reactor at a heating rate of 15 °C/min, reaching a final temperature of 500 °C with a dwell time of 30 min, using 1 L/min of N2 as carrier gas. The pyrolysis products are characterized and evaluated for their potential applications, including petrochemical feedstock, refuse derived fuel (RDF), and solid adsorbent. The results indicate that pyrolysis liquids can be used as RDF in cement kilns, provided the halogen content is below acceptance limits. The gases produced could be used as refinery gases after pollutant removal. Additionally, the solid fraction casts promising results in preliminary tests as a drug adsorbent in water, suggesting a new and very interesting path of research. Life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that the pyrolysis of sample C, which has the worst chemical properties, gives the lowest environmental impact, since the solid fraction from this sample is the most effective adsorbent, achieving almost 100 % removal efficiency for the tested drugs. The findings suggest that pyrolysis of plastic-rich streams should not always be focused on the oil production, as it can yield other valuable products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics from WEEE using a defined reactor setup, with measurable product yields and detailed characterization of oil, gas, and char products."
"Regulation of co-pyrolysis behavior of Naomaohu coal and polypropylene by controlling the cracking of polypropylene pyrolysis volatiles Pyrolysis is one of the technologies for clean and efficient conversion and utilization of coal, however, low yield and poor quality of tar restrict its utilization. Waste polypropylene (PP) could be efficiently used to improve tar yield of low-rank coal via co-pyrolysis. To strengthen the generation and transfer of hydrogen-rich radicals, modified HZMS-5 (HZ5) catalyst was used to regulate the composition of PP pyrolysis volatiles. Results show that close contact between HZ5 catalyst and coal favors the formation of light components, which reaches the maximum value of 72.45 wt%. In the presence of zeolite catalysts modified with 0.2 mol/L NaOH (0.2Na-HZ5), light oil in tar exhibits an obvious increase of 12.78 % compared with HZ5. A synergetic effect analysis clarifies that C2-C3 produced from PP pyrolysis under the action of the catalyst participate in the formation of tar. And the reactive intermediates from secondary cracking of PP volatiles over 0.2Na-HZ5 promote the cleavage of O-containing groups in coal, leading to the increase of phenols and alcohols in tar. The co-pyrolysis behavior of benzyl phenyl ether /bibenzyl and PP is shown that the transfer of oxygenated compounds into liquid is enhanced, confirming a positive synergetic effect. Meanwhile, the clear inhibition of C2-C3 components further indicates their contribution to tar formation.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) and coal with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Production of C5-C12 olefins by catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene with MCM-41 in CO2/N2 The current high volume of plastic waste, but low recycling rate, has led to environmental pollution and wasted energy. Greenhouse gas CO2 can facilitate thermal cracking to dehydrogenate waste plastics, and has potential value for producing olefins. In this work, the pyrolysis properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and Py-GC/MS. The effect of the pyrolysis atmosphere, using N2 or CO2, with various MCM-41 catalyst ratios on pyrolysis product distribution, were investigated. The experimental results show that the olefin selectivity under a N2 atmosphere was from 30.32 % to 44.66 % which increased as the MCM-41 catalyst was increased. Under a CO2 atmosphere, the olefin selectivity reached a maximum of 60.39 %. The Boudouard reaction was also enhanced by the introduction of CO2. The carbon content of the subdivided olefins showed that in CO2, the promotion of C5-C12 olefins was relatively weak when non-catalyzed or at low catalytic ratios, but increased significantly at higher MCM-41 catalyst ratios. With a ratio of LDPE: MCM-41 = 5:4, the CO2 atmosphere showed the greatest promotion of C5-C12 olefins over N2, with an increase of 14.66 % compared to N2, representing a 48.54 % yield of the liquid product. Producing C5-C12 olefins under these conditions maximized energy efficiency. These results show that catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE under a CO2 atmosphere has great potential to produce C5-C12 olefins, which can be used to produce high-value chemicals such as naphtha and gasoline. This opens new opportunities for the chemical recycling of plastic waste.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under controlled reactor conditions."
"Pyrolysis characteristics of RDF and HPDE blends with biomass The main objective of this work was to study refuse-derived fuels (RDF) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) upgrading by pyrolysis of blends of these materials with wood. The study considered three operational conditions: cracking temperature, heating rate, and different wt.% of RDF and HDPE. The results demonstrate that the cracking temperature of 500 °C and the faster heating rates increased the liquid yield for RDF blends. On the other hand, HDPE blends favor gas production at 550 °C and faster heating rates, which enhance the process operativity because polymeric materials generate waxes and are reduced beneath such conditions. Finally, produced gas LHV increases as RDF and HDPE were added. For example, the LHV of the produced gas only with wood at 550 °C and 20 °C/min was 10.34 MJ/m3 and with 25 wt% HDPE was 14.82 MJ/m3.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE) blended with biomass and RDF, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and fuel LHV data reported."
"Co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass with Co/sludge fly ash catalyst Catalytic co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass pine sawdust (PSD) under sludge fly ash (SFA) could be a breakthrough towards the energy challenges and waste management. This paper aims to develop a unique cobalt-alkali-SFA (Co-A-SFA) catalyst, in order to investigate its influence under optimal operating conditions in a fixed bed reactor for syngas production. The catalytic activity was assessed under different Co loading and support ratios. The results indicated that in the presence of Co-A-SFA catalyst, gas production increased due to alkali pretreated fly ash catalyst. Moreover, increasing the Co loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, the syngas production increased irrespective of the individual feedstock ratios. Under catalytic conditions of 5 and 10 wt% the H2 yield to 25.4% and 28.3% for 50/50 MSW/PSD compared to 11.5 wt% under no catalyst. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of MSW and PSD also minimized the concentration of complex liquid compounds and heavy hydrocarbons. Therefore, this study establishes a new approach towards energy production and sustainable waste management through useful resource utilization of MSW, PSD and SFA. The outcomes acquired in this investigation showed that blended feedstock in co-pyrolysis of MSW and pine sawdust could enhance production of valuable syngas under SFA-based catalyst.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (MSW) and biomass (pine sawdust) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable syngas yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Synthesis of nanocrystalline cellulose induced hierarchical porous ZSM-5 for catalytic conversion of low-density polyethylene The catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene over hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite was studied to improve liquid oil quality in a facile reactor for the first time. The HZZ was successfully synthesized by using green and inexpensive nanocrystalline cellulose as a mesoporous template. Nanocrystalline cellulose played a disturbing role in the crystallization process of hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite, which facilitated the formation of ordered surface morphology and excellent porous structure. Compared with conventional HZSM-5, hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly improve the bio-oil yield. The relative content of cycloalkanes increased while the relative content of aromatics decreased. The 94.4 area.% of jet fuel range hydrocarbons with 51.8 area.% cycloalkanes and 25.0 area.% of aromatics can be obtained. Hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite with a low Si/Al ratio had high acidity favors high liquid yield and aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity. The current work contributes to the green synthesis of Hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite while providing a novel catalyst for value-added fuels production from waste plastics pyrolysis.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene, a waste plastic, with measurable product yields and composition analysis, conducted in a lab-scale reactor with experimental characterization."
"Efficient disposal of waste polyolefins through microwave assisted pyrolysis Waste or contaminated polyolefins were disposed through microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) using tires or carbonaceous char as microwave (MW) absorber. High density polyethylene (HDPE) was converted into waxy products when standard heating was employed. However HDPE was converted into a low viscosity fraction by using a very low MW power, but a not completed conversion was achieved while PP was always converted into a liquid having a low viscosity. Using an oven containing a system able to fractionate the vapor formed, the residence time of the waxy products in the oven was improved together with the overall pyrolysis efficiency. However the time of the process was strongly reduced with respect to processes using a classical heating. The liquid fraction from HDPE contained linear alkanes and 1-alkenes with negligible formation of branched, cyclic, or aromatic hydrocarbons, while liquid from PP was formed by a mixture of methyl-branched alkane and alkenes, and sometimes aromatics as a function of pyrolysis conditions.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (HDPE and PP) with measurable product yields, product composition analysis, and reactor condition optimization."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of bauhinia purpurea seed and waste medical plastics for sustainable biofuel production: Kinetic analysis and prediction modeling The present study aims to investigate the potential of Bauhinia purpurea seed (BPS) and waste medical plastic (WMP) as renewable fuels. Physicochemical and thermal studies show that BPS is a great raw material for pyrolysis because it has high calorific value, rich volatility, a lot of large functional groups, and favourable surface morphology. The activation energy was calculated using the KAS, FWO, Starink, and Friedman methods. Both RSM and ANN identified the optimal conditions for bio-oil production at a temperature of 550°C, a heating rate of 10 °C/min, a blend ratio of 70 % BPS (30 % WMP), and a particle size of 1 mm, with a generated bio-oil of 43.24 %. Notably, the predicted bio-oil yield (44.4 %) closely matched the experimental result (43.24 %). The bio-oil is obtained through pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis at optimum conditions. An analysis determined the suitability of bio-char as an activated carbon in catalytic pyrolysis.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste medical plastics and biomass, with measurable product yields, optimized conditions, and experimental characterization of bio-oil and bio-char."
"Purification and characterisation of post-consumer plastic pyrolysis oil fractionated by vacuum distillation Valorisation of post-consumer plastic pyrolysis oil in steam crackers and their application as precursors to chemicals is currently hindered by the complexity of these oils in terms of their boiling range, the risk of fouling by unsaturated compounds, and the presence of contaminations (heteroatoms, metals, and halogens). To gain insights into which of these challenges is actually a potential showstopper, we have studied the vacuum distillation of pyrolysis oil derived from two sorted post-consumer waste plastics, i.e. polypropylene (PP) rigids and mixed polyolefins (MPO) rigids, in a batch fractionating column. The crude pyrolysis oil samples were distilled in three fractions i.e., the light fraction (final boiling point 360 °C). Subsequently, comprehensive characterisation, such as physicochemical properties, the level of contaminations, and chemical composition, was performed. The suitability of the light and middle fractions for steam cracking and precursors to chemical feedstock was assessed. It was found that the density and viscosity values of light and middle fractions from the two pyrolysis oil samples were comparable to fossil naphtha and diesel, whereas total acid number (TAN) values were notably higher compared to petroleum-based oil fractions (>0.5 mgKOH/g). Analyses via GC-MS and ATR-FTIR revealed predominant concentrations of olefins. ICP-OES analysis showed that distillation removes more than 97.5% of metals in all fractions. The chlorine content (>3 ppm), nitrogen (≥0.1%), and oxygen (≥0.1%) exceed thresholds. Hence, this study shows that vacuum distillation effectively improved most, but not all, of the properties of the distilled fractions and can thus be an essential downstream process step for the application of post-consumer plastic pyrolysis oils as feedstock in steam crackers and precursors to chemicals.","The study involves lab-scale vacuum distillation of pyrolysis oil derived from post-consumer plastic waste (PP and mixed polyolefins), with measurable product yields, analytical characterization (GC-MS, ATR-FTIR, ICP-OES), and clear experimental data on contaminant removal and fuel properties."
"Gas-solid pyrolysis of tire wastes — Kinetics and material balances of batch pyrolysis of used tires Pyrolysis processes have been proposed for converting tire wastes into valuable products, particularly through gas-solid contact in various reactor designs. In this paper, the pyrolysis reaction is analyzed in terms of physical and chemical kinetics. A specific method is described for experimentally studying the kinetics of pyrolysis of tire chips. Pyrolysis time is examined as a function of temperature and sample size for determining limitations of the process: heat transfer and chemical kinetics. Conversion curves are modelled and discussed. As a technical basis for evaluating the realistic potential of any industrial batch process, pyrolysis of used tires is studied in a pilotscale unit (100-L retort reactor). Results of material balances as well as quality of products are presented.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic-containing waste, with measured product yields, material balances, and reactor conditions."
"Upcycling disposable face masks into fuel range iso-alkanes through hydropyrolysis coupled with vapor-phase hydrocracking The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an alarming accumulation of plastic waste. Herein, an integrated hydropyrolysis and hydrocracking process was performed to upcycle disposable masks into fuel-range iso-alkanes over carbon supported ruthenium (Ru/C). Experimental results indicated that catalyst type significantly affected product distribution during the hydropyrolysis and vapor-phase hydrocracking of disposable masks. Compared with zeolites-induced catalytic cascade process where up to ∼25.9 wt% yield of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylenes were generated, a ∼82.7 wt% yield of desirable iso-alkanes with a high C5–C12 gasoline selectivity of 95.5% was obtained over Ru/C under 550 °C hydropyrolysis temperature and 300 °C hydrocracking temperature at 0.2 MPa H2. The cascade hydropyrolysis and hydrocracking process also exhibited high adaptability and flexibility in upcycling single-use syringes, food packaging, and plastic bags, generating 79.1, 81.6, and 80.3 wt% yields of fuel range iso/n-alkanes, respectively. This catalytic cascade hydrotreating process provides an efficient and effective approach to convert pandemic-derived plastic waste into gasoline-range fuel products.","The study involves lab-scale hydropyrolysis and hydrocracking of disposable face masks, a waste plastic, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Production of CO-rich syngas through CO2-Mediated pyrolysis of plastic waste and its practical use for power generation Pyrolysis of plastic waste has emerged as a strategic measure to produce liquid fuel, expanding applicability in internal combustion engines under controllable equivalence ratio. However, a difficulty in the precise control of hydrocarbon (HC) chain lengths in the liquid fuel still restricts its reliable utilization. To produce more combustible fuel, transforming plastic waste into gaseous fuels may be more viable approach. This study thus investigated a pyrolytic conversion of plastic waste, plastic bag waste (PBW), into syngas while leveraging carbon dioxide (CO2) as a partial oxidative agent. Pyrolysis of PBW generates a broad spectrum of HCs, which are unsuitable as transportation fuel. However, introducing CO2 enabled its interaction with PBW-derived pyrogenic HCs, partially shortening their carbon chain lengths. A nickel (Ni) catalyst was introduced to accelerate the reaction kinetics to govern the functional reactivity of CO2. Peak intensities of pyrogenic HCs were notably reduced, with effective conversion into CO-rich syngas, contributing to the enhanced carbon availability and suppressed CO2 emission within the proposed pyrolysis system. Catalytic pyrolysis was conducted under diverse temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) and CO2 concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 80 vol% CO2) to optimize the mechanistic reactivity of CO2. For a practical evaluation, the resulting CO-rich syngas was simulated in a gas turbine cycle model for power generation. The thermodynamic variables were determined using the syngas compositional matrix and then used to estimate gas turbine performances including work output and thermal efficiency. The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycle was significantly enhanced when utilizing CO-rich syngas produced from CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis, demonstrating more than two-fold increase compared with commercial natural gas.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of plastic bag waste (a waste plastic) under controlled temperatures and CO2 concentrations, with measurable product yields and syngas composition analysis, and includes experimental reactor conditions and performance evaluation."
"Removal of organobromine compounds from the pyrolysis oils of flame retarded plastics using zeolite catalysts Two flame retarded plastics have been pyrolysed in the presence of two zeolite catalysts to remove the organobromine compounds from the derived pyrolysis oil. The flame retarded plastics were, acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) that was flame retarded with tetrabromobisphenol A and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) that was flame retarded with decabromodiphenyl ether. The two catalysts investigated were zeolite ZSM-5 and zeolite Y-Zeolite. Pyrolysis was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at a final pyrolysis temperature of 440°C. The pyrolysis gases were passed immediately to a fixed bed of the catalyst. It was found that the presence of zeolite catalysts increased the amount of gaseous hydrocarbons produced during pyrolysis but decreased the amount of pyrolysis oil produced. In addition, significant quantities of coke were formed on the surface of the catalysts during pyrolysis. The zeolite catalysts were found to reduce the formation of some valuable pyrolysis products such as styrene and cumene, but other products such as naphthalene were formed instead. The zeolite catalysts, especially Y-Zeolite, were found to be very effective at removing volatile organobromine compounds. However, they were less effective at removing antimony bromide from the volatile pyrolysis products, although some antimony bromide was found on the surfaces of the spent catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste flame-retarded plastics (ABS and HIPS) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Aviation fuel hydrocarbons from camphorwood and low-density polyethylene: Cascade catalytic approach with CaO and Zn/HBeta In this study, the co-pyrolysis of camphorwood and low-density polyethylene employing a cascade catalyst system consisting of CaO and Zn-modified HBeta in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated for the production of aviation fuel hydrocarbons (C8–C16). The effect of Zn loading on HBeta, CaO to Zn/HBeta mass ratio, and the feedstock to catalyst mass ratio on both oil yield and composition was investigated. Results revealed that loading Zn onto HBeta led to ZnO cluster and oxygen-bridged Zn dimers ([ZnOZn]2+) formation, which affects HBeta's acid properties and aromatization capacity. The 10 wt%Zn/HBeta catalyst with more ZnO content exhibited weak acid sites, and moderate aromatization capacity, increasing oil yield from 32.06 to 44.25 wt% compared to 3 wt%Zn/HBeta and favoring presence of straight-chain components in oil products. CaO also enhanced straight-chain alkane formation. The highest oil yield, reaching 48.44 wt%, was obtained when CaO and 10 wt%Zn/HBeta cascade by a 1:1 mass ratio was adopted, producing oil with aviation fuel with a maximum yield of 18.45 wt%, and selectivity of 38.09 area%, of which 26.54 area% being aromatics and 11.55 area% being alkanes. Furthermore, the feedstock-to-catalyst ratio influenced the products significantly, with lower feedstock-to-catalyst ratio enhanced aromatization and the ratio of 2:1 recommended. Therefore, this cascade catalytic approach, which combines cost-effective CaO and 10 wt%Zn/HBeta catalysts shows significant potential for enhancing bio-aviation fuel production from solid wastes. Moreover, it provides a viable and promising solution for addressing concerns related to low oil yield and excessive aromatization.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (a waste plastic) with experimental data on oil yield, composition, and catalyst performance."
"Production of value-added aromatics from wasted COVID-19 mask via catalytic pyrolysis In this study, wasted mask is chosen as a pyrolysis feedstock whose generation has incredibly increased these days due to COVID-19. We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 °C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5. This is the first report of the effect of zeolite characteristics on BTEX production via CFP.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste COVID-19 masks, a type of plastic waste, in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Recovery and reuse of carbon fibre and acrylic resin from thermoplastic composites used in marine application The development of new sustainable routes towards better environmental footprint of composites for marine boatbuilding is motivated by the absence of eco-friendly and economically viable recycling techniques to deal with growing end-of-life thermoset boats waste and increasing restrictive legislation. Thermoplastic composites may offer the possibility to recover raw materials from retired parts, which could have a substantial environmental and economic benefit. This study investigates the feasibility of recovery and reuse of both reinforcement and matrix from a carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic Elium composite. An original pyrolysis process allowed the depolymerisation of the acrylic matrix and recovery of clean carbon fibres and matrix monomer. Distillation was used to purify the monomer from impurities and a recycled Elium resin was synthesized and reused as matrix with long and aligned recycled carbon fibre reinforcement. The study of the morphological and composition differences at fibre scale resulted in concluding that sizing has been decomposed during depolymerisation process and only small traces of polymer were left on fibre surface. Virgin and recycled resin reinforced with carbon fibre laminates were produced by resin infusion. While tensile modulus, strength and strain at break were nearly unchanged, interlaminar shear strength results showed enhanced fibre-matrix interphase bonding. Dynamic mechanical analysis confirmed the good quality of recovered carbon fibres as well as similar virgin and re-polymerised resin properties. The new composite made from both recycled fibre and matrix could be used in the same application field.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of a thermoplastic composite to depolymerize the acrylic matrix, recover carbon fibers, and purify monomers, with measurable outcomes including material recovery, product composition, and mechanical property comparisons."
"Pyrolysis plastic oil production and optimisation followed by maximum possible replacement of diesel with bio-oil/methanol blends in a CRDI engine The primary focus of this study was to effectively extract the available energy from plastic wastes and provide maximum possible replacement of diesel fuel. After careful optimisation of reaction time, reaction temperature and the catalyst percentage, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic wastes were converted into fuel by catalytic pyrolysis process. The plastic oil was then used to operate a single-cylinder common rail direct injection diesel engine. The operating parameters such as compression ratio, injection timing and injection pressure of the test engine were optimised by the Taguchi method. The test engine's performance, combustion, and emission values at 800 bar injection pressure with an advanced injection timing (27° bTDC) were analysed for different brake mean effective pressure values. It was clear that the increase in plastic oil concentration affected the combustion process, and a significant reduction in the performance factors were noticed, especially above 40% addition. Methanol and diethyl ether (DEE) were added to the P40 blend at different ratios to counteract the reductions. These additions showed a significant improvement producing 31.25% of brake thermal efficiency and reducing hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide levels to 2.3, 20.28, 34.61 g/h and smoke to 44% at full load condition. The results proved that diesel fuel could be replaced partially by plastic oil up to a maximum of 40%, and the adverse effects of using plastic oil can be eliminated with the usage of methanol fuel and diethyl ether additive.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste plastic, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of fuel performance in a diesel engine."
"Pyrolysis study of a PVDC and HIPS-Br containing mixed waste plastic stream: Effect of the poly(ethylene terephthalate) Pyrolysis of poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC), brominated flame retardant containing high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br), poly(ethylene) (PE), poly(propylene) (PP), poly(styrene) (PS) mixed were performed in the presence and absence of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) under atmospheric pressure at 430°C using a semi-batch operation. We attempted the dehalogenation (Cl, Br) of chlorinated and brominated liquid hydrocarbons using iron oxide and calcium hydroxide based carbon composites for the production of halogen free liquid hydrocarbons. The presence of PET in the plastics mixture of PP/PE/PS/PVDC/HIPS-Br affected significantly the formation of pyrolysis products and the pyrolysis behavior of plastic mixture. We observed the following effects of PET on the pyrolysis of PP/PE/PS/PVCD/HIPS-Br mixed plastic pyrolysis: (i) The yield of liquid product was decreased and the formation of gaseous products increased during the thermal decomposition, (ii) the waxy residue was observed in addition to the solid carbon residue and (iii) use of calcium hydroxide carbon composite (CaH–C) removed the major portion of chlorine and bromine content from the liquid products from PP/PE/PS/PVDC/HIPS-Br pyrolysis, however in the presence of PET, the combination of calcium hydroxide carbon composite (CaH–C) and iron oxide carbon composites could not dehalogenate the liquid products effectively. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the presence of antimony compounds in carbon and wax residues.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVDC, HIPS-Br, PE, PP, PS, PET) with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products and residues."
"Thermal degradation of polyethylene into fuel oil over silica–alumina by a continuous flow reactor A continuous flow reactor was operated at 420°C and feed rate of 0–1.5kgh−1 for catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) over SA-1 silica–alumina in order to investigate the effect of catalyst on the reaction rate and the quantity and quality of degradation products. SA-1 was either mixed with the PE inside reactor or placed in a catalyst cage, the efficiency being slightly higher in the first case. The catalyst did not have a significant effect on the reaction rates but the volatile products clearly had lower molecular weights. More gases were produced on SA-1 compared to thermal degradation, containing higher amounts of C4 and less amounts of C2 compounds.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) in a lab-scale continuous flow reactor with measurable product yields, temperature conditions, and product composition analysis."
"Defluorination and directional conversion to light fuel by lithium synergistic vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis for electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride in spent lithium-ion batteries To overcome the drawbacks of current recycling technologies and achieve clean utilization of toxic substances in spent lithium-ion batteries, a lithium synergistic vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis method was proposed to defluorinate electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride with directional conversion to light fuel. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry results indicated, compared to the control group, that adding CaO-ZSM-5 catalyst increased the light fuel (alcohols and hydrocarbons) content of the pyrolysis gas from 61.8 % to 91.47 % under the optimal conditions (530 °C and initial pressure of 100 Pa), whereas the total proportion of esters and toxic organic compounds decreased from 32.58 % to 3.99 %. Moreover, the ethylene carbonate and hexanedinitrile content of the electrolyte was enriched to 85 % in the pyrolysis oil. Notably, fluoride was not detected in the pyrolysis oil and gas, achieving a 98.16 % defluorination rate, implying that hazardous waste was transformed to ordinary waste, thereby greatly avoiding toxic emissions to the environment. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data indicated that fluorine was fixed in the form of CaF2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and XRD analysis of the catalytic pyrolysis residue confirmed that nonferrous metals in the cathode material were converted into simple substances and oxides. Finally, possible co-pyrolysis mechanisms of the organic compounds are proposed, including Li+ generation, chain initiation, catalytic pyrolysis, and directional conversion.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyvinylidene fluoride and electrolyte from spent lithium-ion batteries, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst performance data."
"New insights into typical biodegradable plastics in rapid pyrolysis: Kinetics, product evolution and transformation mechanism Biodegradable plastics (BP) have undergone rapid development in the field of replacing traditional packaging plastics. However, their recycling and disposal systems are unclear, and the standards are different, causing new environmental pollution. The rapid and appropriate disposal of BP has become a worthy direction of exploration. Here, rapid pyrolysis technology was used to explore the recycling of BP, and the product evolution and transformation mechanism of typical BP (BP1∼BP4) were analyzed. The results show that the main reaction stages of BP pyrolysis are concentrated at approximately 260∼450 °C. Most of the heat treatment stages of BP conform to the random nucleation and nuclear growth model An (n = 1.5, 2, 2.5. 3). The gaseous products of BP pyrolysis were mainly 1, 3-butadiene. The top four pyrolysis components are the same for the liquid products of BP1, BP2, and BP4, which are mainly benzoic acid (42.54%–44.67%). However, the proportion of polycyclic aromatic substances in the products of the BP3 pyrolysis solution was as high as 63.85%. For the transformation mechanism, BP containing polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene terephthalate-adipate (PBAT) is mainly composed of C–O bond fractures at the ester group and intramolecular hydrogen transfer to form a carboxyl group and CC. This study of BP pyrolysis provides an important scientific basis and theoretical reference for its rational and rapid treatment and product recovery and reuse.","The study involves lab-scale rapid pyrolysis of biodegradable plastics (PLA, PBAT, etc.), reports measurable product yields and composition (e.g., 42.54%–44.67% benzoic acid, 63.85% polycyclic aromatic substances), and includes kinetic analysis and transformation mechanisms based on experimental data."
"Effect of reduction temperatures of Ni-modified zeolites on the product distribution, catalyst deactivation, and reaction mechanism during polypropylene pyrolysis Introducing Ni into ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts stands as an efficacious strategy for augmenting catalytic activity in the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Thermal reduction using H2 serves as a customary approach to convert Ni2+ species to Ni0, bolstering the catalytic efficacy in aromatics conversion. However, thermal treatment is prone to precipitating the agglomeration of Ni metal, leading to a diminution in the active sites of the catalyst. Therefore, this work focused on the effect that arose from different reduction temperatures on the PP catalytic thermal degradation process. According to the analysis of the reduced Ni-modified ZSM-5 catalysts, the size of Ni particles loaded onto the ZSM-5 support progressively increased with escalating reduction temperatures, ranging from 21.7 to 30.5 nm. Excessive size hindered the conversion of Ni0 which played a key role in the acid properties. Moreover, it was discovered that the H2 yield and aromatics proportions increased linearly with the strong acid amount and total B/L ratio, respectively. By contrast, the modified catalyst treated at 500 °C displayed superior catalytic performance. Additionally, coke generation was favored by the enlarged size of Ni particles. These findings were instrumental in advancing the development of reduced metal catalysts utilized in the thermal conversion treatment of plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst characterization, and analysis of reaction mechanisms and deactivation."
Kinetic study of the catalytic cracking of polypropylene in a semibatch stirred reactor A lumped kinetic model including both thermal and catalytic cracking and catalyst decay has been developed for the cracking of polypropylene in a semibatch stirred reactor. Two decay equations in where the catalyst decay is either a function of time on stream or function of coke on catalyst have been tested. The kinetic model fits very well the experimental results and is able to simulate the process in a wide range of operating conditions.,"The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, in a lab-scale semibatch stirred reactor with measurable experimental results and kinetic modeling based on real data."
"Effects of cellulose contamination on polystyrene recycling to styrene monomer via microwave pyrolysis The increasing population and by extension the plastic waste increasing rate requires innovative waste management mitigation solutions, especially for a challenging polymer such as polystyrene. However, the presence of a broad range of contaminants in its waste stream, cellulose-based contaminants being one of the most prevalent, hinders polystyrene recycling. Herein, a microwave co-pyrolysis of polystyrene and cellulose was carried out to recycle styrene as monomer and to investigate the synergy between both reactants at 500°C. Polystyrene pyrolysis presented a high styrene yield of 0.355g styrene/g polystyrene; while as the cellulose content increased, higher amounts of hydrogen are produced, leading to the hydrogenation of styrene into ethylbenzene and other styrenic derivatives such as 1,4-Diphenyl-2-butene and 1,3-Diphenyl-1-butene. A noticeable 29% decrease in styrene yield was observed for an equal amount of polystyrene and cellulose. At the same conditions, the detrimental effect of the co-pyrolysis also involved the reduction of the oil yield, from 58.9%, polystyrene pyrolysis, to 30.2%. The negative synergy between cellulose and polystyrene co-pyrolysis for the recycling of styrene monomer indicates that polystyrene waste streams must be handled thoroughly prior to being recycled.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of polystyrene, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields and compositional analysis, including a 29% decrease in styrene yield due to cellulose contamination."
"Study on flame properties and molecular dynamics of MAP suppression for polyethylene dust explosion The effect of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (MAP) on polyethylene (PE) dust explosions was analyzed through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The vertical tube explosion experiments showed that the maximum propagation distance of the explosion flame decreased with the increase of MAP mass fractions. The simultaneous thermal analysis experiments revealed that the addition of MAP enhanced the thermal stability of the powder and reduced the combustion exotherm. The molecular dynamics simulation showed that in the pyrolysis system, The groups such as NH3 derived from MAP participated in and slowed down the PE decomposition process and led to the decrease of hydrocarbon gas production, such as the number of C2H4 production decreased from 161 to 112. In the combustion system, oxygen-containing groups induced the initial decomposition of PE and generated CO2 and CH2O, while MAP and its decomposition products preempted the oxygen-containing groups, resulting in the interruption of the chain reaction of PE decomposition and combustion and generating a large amount of H2O, which accounted for 26.67 % of its total generation pathways. Moreover, it was also observed from the perspective of product distribution that increasing the temperature could accelerate and deepen reactions but did not change the suppression mechanism.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) under varying conditions, including temperature effects and the influence of MAP on decomposition products, with measurable data on hydrocarbon gas production and reaction pathways."
"Fuel properties of the oils produced from the pyrolysis of commonly-used polymers: Effect of fractionating column The effects of using a packed column as a fractionating system on thermal degradation of commonly-used polymers have been studied. The polymers investigated were virgin polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), as well as two post-consumer polymer mixtures, namely municipal plastic waste (MPW) and scrap tire. The experiments were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a 6L semi-batch stainless steel vessel equipped with the fractionating system. The system led to total elimination of wax formation, color improvement, and reduction in the density of the resultant pyrolysis oils. The oils were analyzed according to ASTM D86, the standard test method for boiling range distribution of petroleum fractions. The obtained values were compared to the Iran standard limits established for diesel (ISIRI4903) and gasoline (ISIRI4904). Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was utilized to determine the chemical composition of the oils. Finally, the spectra of the generated tire and MPW-derived oils were compared with the spectra of conventional fuels, gasoline and diesel.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP, PS, MPW, and scrap tire) with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of oil properties using ASTM D86 and FT-IR."
"Synergism and production of hydrocarbon-rich fuel from mixed-feedstock through co-pyrolysis of LDPE and PP: An assessment of fuel properties, engine performance, and gas emission This investigation reports the conversion of waste plastic materials to hydrocarbon-based fuel as an alternative source of energy with a detailed study of fuel properties and CI engine performance including an analysis of gas emission. Low-density polyethylene and polypropylene have been used for the production of hydrocarbon-based pyrolysis oil or pyro-oil. The properties of pyro-oil have been determined using different ASTM methods and analytical techniques such as GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR, FTIR, CHNS analysis, etc. The fuel properties of the pyrolysis oil were more or less similar to that of commercial diesel. The results of mass spectroscopy and NMR confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons like paraffin, aromatic, cyclic olefins, and some lower hydrocarbons. The conversion rate of post consume waste plastic material was found to be 75–81 wt% in the form of liquid, 9–18 wt% fuel gases, and 2–10 wt% as a solid residue. As per the 1H NMR results, the percentage composition in liquid fuels was 9–11 % (v/v) aromatics, 17–26 % (v/v) olefins, and 65–71 % (v/v) paraffin with a degree of branching in the range of 0.84–3.94. The engine performance has been evaluated at different blending ratios using a four-stroke diesel engine. The emission results showed that blending of PO with diesel ∼31.34 % of CO emission could be reduced, while CO2 emission was found to be ∼3.55 % lower in PO blended fuel samples as compared to commercial diesel. On the other hand, the results showed that 10 % and 20 % blending of PO can reduce the un-burnt hydrocarbon release by ∼50.74 % and ∼21.8 % as compared to commercial diesel. The experimental results of performance and combustion revealed that blending of hydrocarbon-rich fuels produced from waste plastic material can reduce the overall fuel consumption as well as enhances the engine performance.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and PP), reports measurable product yields, fuel properties, and engine performance data with analytical characterization."
"Catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by hierarchical catalysts prepared using zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement A hierarchical structure with mesopores was developed around zeolite crystals by zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement (ZDGSR) method where a reinforcing agent composed of hexamethyldisiloxane and acetic anhydride was reacted with HY-zeolite crystals directly. The effects of changing the hydrothermal condition on the development of hierarchical structure of catalysts were examined. In addition, a catalytic cracking of LDPE using the hierarchical catalysts was evaluated by the Curie point pyrolyzer (CPP) method. The micropore surface area in the t-plot method decreased and the external surface area increased with increasing temperature and the elapse of time in the treatment with a reinforcing agent. The result confirmed the development of mesopores derived from zeolite crystals as SiO2 source. In catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by the CPP method using the prepared catalysts, the conversions were similar to or slightly lower than that of the parent Y-zeolite catalyst. When the relative activity, which represents the activity per the amounts of zeolite crystals and acid sites, was estimated using the conversion of LDPE, XRD signal intensity and NH3-TPD value, the linear relationship was observed between the relative activity and the average pore diameter calculated from BET surface area and total pore volume. The result suggested that the pore size of a catalyst could be one of the most important factors to control the intrinsic activity of zeolite in catalytic cracking of LDPE.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, using lab-scale experiments with a Curie point pyrolyzer, measuring conversion and catalyst activity, and providing analytical data on pore structure and performance."
"Conversion of toxic pyrogenic products into syngas through catalytic pyrolysis of insulation material waste under the presence of CO2 Plastic-based insulation materials have been widely employed owing to their exceptional durability, cost-effectiveness, low weight, and low thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, the disposal of the insulation material waste (IMW) within construction waste and its recycling and recovery are challenging. Meanwhile, landfilling or incineration methods can release toxic chemicals into the environment. Consequently, the accumulation of IMW in construction waste has become a pressing environmental concern. To address this issue, this paper proposes a pyrolysis platform as a disposal management method for IMW that employs CO2 as a reactive medium. IMW composed of polystyrene in the form of extruded polystyrene underwent pyrolysis to yield pyrogenic products containing toxic chemicals. These toxic chemicals were subsequently transformed into syngas via homogeneous reactions with CO2 under certain thermal conditions and Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. This resulted in a significant reduction in the total peak areas of toxic substances in the pyrogenic oil compared with that obtained using N2 as a medium. Furthermore, the efficacy of CO2 was demonstrated to increase with an increase in the atmospheric concentration. This study implied that catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 conditions is a potential platform for converting toxic chemicals from IMW into syngas through homogeneous reactions with CO2.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene-based insulation material waste, a commercial plastic, with measurable outcomes including reduction in toxic compounds and syngas production under varying CO2 concentrations."
"Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of recovered heavy oil and municipal plastic wastes In this work municipal plastic wastes were co-pyrolyzed together with waste plastic derived heavy oil at 500°C in a stirred batch reactor using β-zeolite, y-zeolite and m-Ni-Mo-catalysts. The effect of the heavy oil/municipal plastic waste ratio to the product properties was basically investigated. Higher pyrolysis oil and gas yields were observed by the using of catalyst and by the re-using of heavy oils. Catalysts could be affecting especially the concentration of hydrogen, isobutene and isopentane in gases. Both pyrolysis oil and heavy oil contained paraffin, olefins, aromatics and cyclic compounds, while the heavy oil had hydrocarbons with higher molecular weight. Based on GC–MS and EDXRFS results the composition of pyrolysis oil and their contaminants were significantly affected by both the waste plastic/heavy oil ratio and catalyst presence. Lower waste plastic/heavy oil ratio and selected catalyst could efficiently decrease the concentration of contaminants and increase the valuable hydrocarbon content.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste with heavy oil using catalysts, reports measurable product yields, and provides analytical data on product composition and catalyst performance."
"Interaction between feedstocks, absorbers and catalysts in the microwave pyrolysis process of waste plastics This work has selected high density polyethylene (HDPE), activated carbon (AC) and molecular sieves to form microwave pyrolysis system and studied the effects of reaction conditions and material mixing mode on the products. The mass ratio of HDPE and AC is between 100:60 and 100:330, and different heating power combinations (20–40% of the maximum power of 900 W) are used to meet the heat transfer requirements in different stages. The heating properties of the AC and the interaction between materials are also discussed. The results show that the temperature distribution of reaction system tends to be higher in the center, which makes the products discharge quickly. Therefore, adopting continuous heating, reducing the residence time and the amount of AC can promote wax formation and the maximum yield was 87.75 wt%. While adopting intermittent heating and complete mixing mode, increasing the residence time and the AC amount are beneficial to the liquid formation (mainly between C7 and C20) with the maximum yield of 82.36 wt%. The catalyst can enhance the break of long chain hydrocarbons and shorten the whole reaction time. However, the catalytic effect on the further pyrolysis of the product is limited due to the high heating speed of microwave field.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of waste HDPE with measurable product yields, catalyst effects, and detailed reaction conditions."
"Kinetic study of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pyrolysis in a spouted bed reactor A spouted bed reactor has been designed and constructed to study the kinetic of the pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), in the temperature range of 450–560°C. The kinetic parameters were determined based on the weight change of the PET sample and were fitted successfully to a first-order kinetic model. Two particle sizes have been considered (0.1–1.0mm and 1.0–3.0mm) in order to study the role of heat and mass transfer limitations probably existed which affect the kinetic parameters. The results confirm a good performance of spouted bed in performing kinetic study of PET pyrolysis at high temperatures. The activation energy of 276.8 and 264.3kJ/mol was determined for particle size ranges of 0.1–1.0 and 1.0–3.0mm, respectively. The similarity between data for the different two particle size ranges revealed that the heat and mass transfer limitations in spouted bed reactors may have been minimized. The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis of PET were evaluated applying isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In such an analysis, the apparent activation energy observed were within the range of 245–292kJ/mol, for different particle sizes studied. There is a good agreement between the data obtained in this study with the values reported in the literature.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of PET plastic in a spouted bed reactor with measured kinetic parameters, activation energies, and product yield relationships at specific temperatures."
"The role of porosity and acidity in the catalytic upcycling of polyethylene Plastics have become fundamental and widespread materials in our everyday life. Nowadays, the most demanded plastics are polyolefins, accounting for nearly half of the Global plastic production. However, the end-of-life disposal of these materials is an issue inevitably connected to their increased production. Among chemical recycling techniques, the most thoroughly investigated process is the catalytic pyrolysis, showing a vast panorama of different set-ups optimized for the major production of either gaseous or liquid compounds. In this contribution a series of mesoporous silica-based materials, either pure SiO2 or substituted with Zr and Al, were systematically synthetized varying both porous framework and surface acidity, in the attempt of rationalizing the effect of each parameter (deeply characterized by physico-chemical methods) on the catalytic pyrolysis of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). The synthetized materials together with some zeolites and aluminas reference samples were tested towards LLDPE degradation in a batch reactor set-up optimized for the formation and accumulation of the gaseous compounds, coupled with IR spectroscopy for in situ monitoring the evolution of the most abundant species (mostly propylene and branched C4-C6 olefins, together with a minor fraction of ethylene and short hydrocarbons). This work points out the necessity of the presence of Brønsted acid sites for a good activity (in terms of both the yield of gaseous products and lowering of the process temperature), but it also reveals a non-negligible role of the Lewis acid sites and it warns about the importance of controlling not only the amount of acid sites but also their strength.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst characterization, and in situ monitoring of gaseous products."
"Microwave assisted pyrolysis of corn derived plastic bags Microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of corn derived plastic bags (CDP) was performed to efficiently dispose waste or contaminated bio-plastic obtaining a liquid useful as source of chemicals and/or fuels. MAP was performed using different microwave (MW) power, MW absorbers (carbon or Fe), and apparatus obtaining a liquid, a char and a gas in amount depending on the pyrolysis conditions. Liquids were always separated in three phases: upper, medium, and bottom and deeply characterized. They contained large amount of aromatic acid, phthalates and their derivatives in the upper fractions. Medium fractions were mainly composed of water (70wt%), acids, alcohols, anhydrosugars and their pyrolysis products. Bottom fractions showed close properties and composition than the upper fractions. The same classes of compounds were present in upper and bottom phases but in the last ones, these compounds were oligomers of those present in the upper fractions. Working with more drastic conditions bottom fraction was reduced while char yield was increased. MAP converted a waste CDP, even contaminated, obtaining some chemicals or even fuel thus avoiding to send them to an anaerobic digestion for they transformation into carbon dioxide, water and a residue without any recovery of chemicals or energy. This process may represent a green way to dispose CDP recovering a liquid useful as a source of chemicals or for production of fuels and avoiding to contaminate the residue of an anaerobic fermentation with plasticizers present in CDP.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of corn-derived plastic bags (a waste plastic), with measurable product yields (liquid, char, gas), phase separation, and detailed chemical characterization of the liquid products."
"Effects of torrefaction on the formation and distribution of dioxins during wood and PVC pyrolysis: An experimental and mechanistic study Dioxins reduction is crucial for the pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW). In this work, torrefaction was employed as a pretreatment for inhibiting the synthesis of dioxins. A mixture of poplar and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was used as the model MSW and provided the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) source and chlorine sources, respectively. A torrefaction-pyrolysis experiment was performed in a tubular furnace system, and the weight loss and chlorine release (mainly in the form of hydrogen chloride) were evaluated. The dioxins distribution in the products were detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Thermogravimetric Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) was employed to clarify the chlorination of PAHs. The results showed that torrefaction could reduce 98.63 % of the total amount of dioxins and reduce 99.09 % of the toxic equivalent of volatile dioxins. Since torrefaction cut the Cl participation of MSW (from PVC) by 86.94 %, the overall reaction process was simplified, and the temperature of the maximum conversion rate was increased. In addition, the analysis of the functional groups indicated that most dioxins during pyrolysis was synthesized from 200 ℃ to 400 ℃ . This research demonstrated a significant emission reduction, which effected by torrefaction, and provided a new idea for dioxins clean pyrolysis of MSW.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PVC-containing waste (a commercial plastic) in a tubular furnace with measurable yields, product analysis, and experimental characterization of dioxins and chlorine release."
"Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of marine debris: A waste to wealth conversion study for energy recovery The rapid increase in marine waste has resulted in the accumulation of plastic marine debris (PMD), which is of concern to the scientific community due to the need for its safe disposal worldwide. PMD primarily consists of non-degradable polymeric waste, namely thermoplastics, which contain a substantial amount of energy as they are made from petroleum-based sources. Proper disposal and energy reclamation of this waste have become pressing topics. This study aimed to investigate PMD through thermogravimetric analysis followed by pyrolysis in the temperature range of 450–600 °C. Additionally, two catalysts, 10% nickel impregnated activated alumina (10% Ni/Al2O3) and sodium aluminosilicate (AlNaO6Si2), were incorporated (non-contacting method) to evaluate their effect on product yield and quality. During the non-catalytic process, the highest yield (∼78%) was achieved at a temperature of 550 °C while the presence of a catalyst had a minimal effect on oil density (0.74–0.76), and the percentage yield decreased to ∼ 58 and ∼ 62% using AlNaO6Si2 and 10% Ni/Al2O3 at 550 °C. The catalyst had a significant effect on the fraction of oxygenated compounds in the oil, reducing it by ∼ 18% from the non-catalytic process. AlNaO6Si2 resulted in a higher fraction of gasoline-range compounds, while 10% Ni/Al2O3 showed a higher similarity towards diesel fractions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis identified the presence of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, alcohols, and other compounds in the oil product, with variations observed depending on the catalyst used. The results showed that among all hydrocarbons, propane had the maximum fraction, followed by ethane, methane, and butane in the gaseous compounds. Based on the degradation mechanism, yield distribution, and component evolution, the dissociation mechanism for both processes was explained.","The study involves lab-scale thermocatalytic pyrolysis of marine plastic debris (a waste plastic feedstock) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization using GC–MS and thermogravimetric analysis."
"Efficient and selective dual-pathway polyolefin hydro-conversion over unexpectedly bifunctional M/TiO2-anatase catalysts The huge scale of plastic waste generation and its environmental consequences drive the demands for catalytic plastic upcycling processes. Here, we report efficient polypropylene (PP) hydro-conversion over Ru and Ni supported on a sol-gel anatase TiO2 (TiO2-A-SG). A small number of Brønsted acid sites on TiO2-A-SG enables hydrocracking, improving efficiency, steering the selectivity towards high-valued C4–20, and allowing more isomerization, compared to Ru-based monofunctional hydrogenolysis catalysts. The relative contribution of hydrocracking increases with lower hydrogen partial pressure, more branched substrates, and lower Ru loading. Ni/TiO2-A-SG exhibits superior hydrocracking activity and selectivity to Ni on conventional Brønsted-acidic supports, particularly zeolites. Mechanistic studies shows fast isomerization and sequential β-scissions caused by strong polymer-catalyst interaction and fast cracking with abundant 3C. This favors C4–12 formation and prevents secondary reactions. This work demonstrated a novel, highly efficient noble-metal-free catalyst for plastic waste upcycling, while advancing the mechanistic understanding of polyolefin hydro-conversion.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), a waste plastic, with measurable product selectivity, catalyst performance, and mechanistic analysis of hydrocracking and isomerization."
"Recovery of glass fibre and carbon fibres from reinforced thermosets by batch pyrolysis and investigation of fibre re-using as reinforcement in LDPE matrix A semi-batch pyrolysis process was used to recover samples carbon fibre and glass fibre from their respective wastes. The mechanical properties of the recovered fibres were tested and compared to those of virgin fibres, showing good retention of the fibre properties. The recovered fibres were then used to prepare new LDPE composite materials with commercial and laboratory-synthesized compatibilizers. Mild oxidation of the post-pyrolysis recovered fibres and the use of different compatibilizers gave significant improvements in the mechanical properties of the LDPE composites; however some of the manufactured composites made from recovered fibres had properties similar to those made from virgin fibres.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of reinforced thermosets to recover carbon and glass fibers, with measurable outcomes including fiber mechanical properties and composite performance."
"Pyrolysis of waste plastics-derived carbon nanomaterials on nickel foam for utilization as an efficient binder-free electrode: Effect of catalyst loading on capacitive performance The pyrolytic liquid and gas products are extensively analyzed for practical applications, but, few applications exist for solid product from waste plastics pyrolysis. This study investigates energy storage potential of waste plastics-derived carbon nano-materials (CNMs), pyrolyzed directly on nickel foam (NF) coated with nickel alumina catalyst, in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Effect of increasing nickel to aluminum molar ratio (0.05, 0.1, 0.2) in energy storage capacity is studied. Galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, at 0.125 A g−1, show highest specific capacitance of 153.75 F g−1 for 0.1 molar ratio. The reason for such high performance is mainly because of a) greater metal-support interaction by using NF substrate, b) formation of CNMs according to base-growth mechanism, providing metal free surface at the top, and c) the presence of equal amounts of disordered and ordered carbons, resulting in meso- and micro-porous structures, providing high electrolyte availability at the electrode surface. The retained rectangle shape of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve after 5000 cycles, with 98.5 % capacitance retention, also exhibits stability and durability of produced electrode. Though the fabricated electrode involved no post-treatment, yet, it showed higher performance than commercial CNMs. Therefore, this study open new ways to fabricate environment friendly and economically effective supercapacitors.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics on nickel foam with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of the resulting carbon nanomaterials for energy storage."
"Pyrolysis kinetics and reaction mechanism of representative non-charring polymer waste with micron particle size Pyrolysis is considered as a promising method to dispose polymer waste. To provide guidance for pyrolysis recycling of representative non-charring polymer namely poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) waste with micron particle size, the pyrolysis kinetics and reaction mechanism of micron PMMA waste in nitrogen are studied in the present study. Thermogravimetric analyses at 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 K/min coupled with two model-free methods including Senum-Yang and advanced Vyazovkin method as well as one model-fitting method namely Coats-Redfern method are employed. Results indicate that the micron PMMA waste pyrolysis may be nominally considered as one-step reaction. The reaction model and mechanism in charge of the micron PMMA waste pyrolysis may be g ( α ) = 1 - α - 1 / 2 - 1 and chemical reaction, respectively. The average values of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor are 243.69 kJ/mol and 1.19 × 1019 min−1, respectively, which are both larger than those of traditional PMMA with particle size in millimeter or larger level. Based upon the one-step reaction model and the obtained kinetic parameters, the predicted thermogravimetric data agree well with the experimental results not only at heating rates of 5, 10 and 20 K/min which are employed to calculate the kinetic parameters, but also at heating rates of 30 and 40 K/min beyond those used to calculate the kinetic parameters.","The study involves lab-scale thermogravimetric analysis of micron-sized poly(methyl methacrylate) waste, a commercial plastic, with measurable kinetic parameters, product yield predictions, and experimental characterization."
"Pyrolysis of mixed contaminated plastic wastes: Assessing the influence of polymers composition, temperature and residence time The European Union’s recycling objectives of 50 % for packaging by 2025 and 55 % by 2030 are still far from the current recycling rate of 37.8 %. Thermochemical recycling via pyrolysis might improve recovery rates, especially for challenging post-consumer dirty and contaminated plastics. Many studies focus on the pyrolysis of virgin plastics and artificial mixtures of these plastics to simulate real-world mixed plastic waste scenarios. This study examines a sample of pre-sorting waste from an Italian composting plant to represent real plastic mixtures within the collection chain. This waste contains plastics, organics, paper, and others, with plastics making up 72.18 % of the sample, primarily identified as LDPE, PP, and HDPE. The plastics were tested individually and as a mixture, mirroring the concentrations observed within the original sample, in a bench-scale semi-batch reactor at varying temperatures (420 °C, 470 °C, and 520 °C) and residence times. The analysis indicated that temperature and residence time considerably influence product yields and composition, although temperature has a more dominant effect. Wax analysis showed paraffins and olefins as the primary components, with a peak carbon number distribution in the C14-C19 range at elevated temperatures. Contaminant analysis of wax identified substantial levels of halogens and metals, posing challenges for downstream processes. Results from the mixture tests revealed that the product yields of individual polymers could be predicted as a linear combination of their behaviors, with an accuracy within a 10 % margin of error across the examined temperature range and lower residence times.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed contaminated plastic waste (LDPE, PP, HDPE) with measurable product yields, temperature–residence time effects, and analytical characterization of wax composition and contaminants."
"Recycling of fiber reinforced composites: Online mass spectrometric tracing, offline physicochemical speciation and toxicological evaluation of a pilot plant pyrolytic conversion The increasing demand for lightweight materials with exceptional stability and durability has resulted in a significant rise in fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) production. These materials find applications in various fields. However, the exceptional properties and diverse compositional range of FRPs pose challenges to conventional recycling strategies. Pyrolysis has emerged as a highly promising approach for separating the fibers from the polymer matrix. In this study, we employed thermal analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the pyrolysis process. Representative FRP showed a starting decomposition temperature of 300 °C and bisphenol A, styrene, alkenes, and phenols could be identified. The identified parameters were used to operate a pilot plant with a capacity of up to 50 kg/h FRP, and reactor products were directly analyzed with soft photoionization mass spectrometry. The findings demonstrated good agreement between the pilot plant results and laboratory experiments, particularly for smaller compounds (m/z<200). The non-condensable fraction showed a range of 17 to 22 MJ/m3 as lower heating value. Analysis of the recovered fibers (diameter between 6.20 and 8.05 μm) revealed residual coke, but no toxic fibers were detected, according to the World Health Organization's definition. Yet, the organic coating of the fibers contained small amounts of potentially harmful PAHs. A toxicological assessment using a multicellular in vitro model confirmed the low hazardous potential of the recovered fibers. The findings contribute to developing sustainable and environmentally friendly recycling strategies for FRP while addressing important aspects related to the safety and toxicological implications of the resulting chemicals and fibers.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of fiber-reinforced plastics with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products and recovered fibers."
"An Aspen plus process simulation model for exploring the feasibility and profitability of pyrolysis process for plastic waste management Plastics, integral to various human activities, have led to a surge in production, posing substantial challenges in waste management. The persistent non-biodegradability of plastics, taking over a century to decompose, necessitates exploration into technologies for their conversion into sustainable fuels. Pyrolysis, an oxygen-free thermal decomposition process, emerges as a promising avenue for producing liquid fuels from plastic waste. This study's primary objective is to create and validate an Aspen Plus simulation model, enabling techno-economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis of pyrolysis for converting waste plastics into liquid fuels. Critical parameters—temperature, retention time, and particle size—are examined for their impact on product yield and quality. The methodology involves model development, validation, and subsequent simulations with various waste plastic types under different pyrolysis conditions. Experimental investigation using waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in an auger reactor yielded an oil yield of 61.29%, char yield of 10.98%, and syngas yield of 27.73% at 525 °C. Post-validation against this data, the model explored four plastic types, revealing significant influences of plastic type and reactor temperature on product yields. Polystyrene (PS) at 500 °C produced the highest oil content at 83.69%, with temperature affecting yield before secondary cracking. Techno-economic evaluation for a pyrolysis plant processing 10,000 tons of waste HDPE annually indicated a minimum selling price (MSP) of $302.50/ton, a net present value (NPV) of $12,594,659.7, and a 1.03-year payback period. This study provides crucial insights for designing an economically viable and sustainable pyrolysis process, guiding further research and industrial implementation.","The study involves lab-scale experimental work on pyrolysis of waste HDPE with measurable yields and product analysis, confirming plastic pyrolysis with extractable data."
"Product regulation mechanism in Joule flash pyrolysis of polyethylene for low carbon olefins and carbon nanospheres Conventional pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) yields low-value, hard-to-separate mixed components. To produce usable products, flash Joule heating (FJH) was employed to selectively convert PE into low-carbon olefins, with carbon nanospheres as a byproduct. In this process, molten PE was evenly spread on a graphite boat and heated to 1250°C, selectively producing low-carbon olefins (C2-C4) with a selectivity of 72.05 %. We examined the effects of chain length, branching structure, and the number of double bonds on reaction pathways and product distribution using three long-chain olefin model compounds (terminal olefin, internal olefin, and polyene hydrocarbon) as well as various polyolefins and their mixtures. We also studied the impact of rapid heating/cooling and peak temperature variations on product regulation. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for the highly selective production of low-carbon olefins and co-production of carbon materials from waste polyolefin plastics.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene using flash Joule heating, with measurable yields of low-carbon olefins and carbon nanospheres, and detailed analysis of product distribution and reaction conditions."
"Synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 by silanization and alkoxylation of protozeolitic units Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been synthesized by means of a method involving a precrystallization stage to form the protozeolitic units, the addition and subsequent grafting of both silanization and alkoxylation agents, and a final hydrothermal crystallization. The influence of the alkoxylation with different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and n-butanol) on the properties of the final hierarchical ZSM-5 samples has been investigated. In every case, the alcohol addition increased the incorporation of the seed silanization agent as it decreases the gel viscosity. In addition, the presence of alcohols deeply affects the physicochemical properties of the final materials. The samples prepared with 2-propanol and methanol were highly crystalline and presented improved textural properties with regard to the reference h-ZSM-5 and n-ZSM-5. In contrast, the samples obtained with ethanol and n-butanol were partially and totally X-ray amorphous, respectively. 1H and 13C-CP solid state MAS NMR spectra proved the alkoxylation of the external surface of the protozeolitic units. Catalytic cracking of LDPE pointed out the higher TOF values obtained over the hierarchical samples prepared with methanol and 2-propanol due to a right combination of accessibility and crystallinity in these materials. The differences observed among the samples prepared with alcohols were ascribed to the strong interaction produced between the silanization agent and the linear alcohols on the surface of the protozeolitic nanounits, which form a very stable protective layer, hindering their aggregation and subsequent crystallization.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE using hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites, with measurable product yields and catalytic performance data (TOF values) reported."
"Development of a microwave thermogravimetric analyzer and its application on polystyrene microwave pyrolysis kinetics To study pyrolysis kinetics inside a microwave environment, a microwave thermogravimetric analyzer was developed. A sample mass as low as 0.3 g can be studied along with silicon carbide as the microwave receptor. The temperature is measured with a custom-made infrared thermopile equipped with different optical filters specific to this application. Validation of the microwave thermogravimetric analyzer features showed that the measured data can be used as is for kinetic development. Different heating profiles can be achieved by modulating the microwave power. The microwave thermogravimetric analyzer was then used for the kinetic development of polystyrene microwave pyrolysis. Polystyrene was chosen because of its low recycling rate and its great potential to produce high-valued products, like styrene. Three heating rates (24.5, 38.5 and 49.5 °C min−1) were used to estimate the kinetic parameters. By comparing several reaction models, a random scission model was found to best explain the experimental data. The choice of the reaction model was made based on two statistical tests: the coefficient of determination R 2 and the residual sum of squares RSS. With this reaction model, an activation energy of E = 45 kJ mol−1 and a pre-exponential constant of ln(A) = 3.6 were found for polystyrene microwave pyrolysis.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of polystyrene, a commercial plastic, with measured temperature–yield relationships, kinetic parameters, and experimental characterization using a custom-built microwave thermogravimetric analyzer."
"Use of plastic waste as a fuel in the co-pyrolysis of biomass Part III: Optimisation of the co-pyrolysis process In this research, the synergistic relationship between the addition of polypropylene and the biomass in the thermal conversion process was studied. Additions of polypropylene in co-pyrolysis process can effect to the degassing of bio-char and may also affect the performance of the yields of liquid and gaseous products that were obtained in the thermal conversion process. The main goal of this research was the determination of the optimal quantity of polypropylene that would cover the full energy demands of the pyrolysis process, depending on the physicochemical properties of the biomass used. In this paper was calculated the degree of energy self-sufficiency of biomass pyrolysis process depending of biomass humidity content and with application of gaseous products from PP thermal depolymerisation as an additional fuel. The design of experiments (DOE) method – central composite rotatable design – was used to investigate the influence of temperature and polypropylene addition on the co-pyrolysis process. Using this method allowed the coverage of energy demand to be determined, as well as the optimal quantity of polypropylene to be added to the pyrolysis process, depending on the physicochemical properties of the biomass used. This method (DOE) was also used to optimise the composition of the solid, liquid and gaseous products obtained during the co-pyrolysis of biomass.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with biomass, including measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and optimization using DOE, with clear experimental data on product composition and energy self-sufficiency."
"Synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of polypropylene and polystyrene The thermal conversion of waste plastic products can provide a promising solution to the issues of environmental pollution, waste management, and energy needs. However, our present understanding on the thermal reforming of different kinds of plastic wastes mixtures during their co-pyrolysis and co-gasification for syngas production and energy recovery is insufficient. Non-selective urban polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) waste plastics were chosen for the investigations reported here. Thermal degradation properties of PP and PS as well as their blends in different mass ratios were investigated via thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Co-pyrolysis and CO2-assisted co-gasification of PP-PS blends were then conducted using a fixed-bed reactor at a temperature of 1173 K. Experimental results from the blends were then compared with the weighted value calculated from their component feedstocks to quantify the degree of synergistic effect. TG results showed that the co-treatment of PP and PS enhanced the respective devolatilization process. The co-pyrolysis of PP and PS enhanced their thermal cracking, leading to synergistic increases in the yields of H2, light hydrocarbons (HC) and total syngas. In co-gasification, the reforming reaction involving CO2 was synergistically enhanced, resulting in the increased yields of H2 and HC. The gasification reactivity of carbon black improved during the co-processing of PP and PS due to the synergistic effect between the two different kinds of plastics. Higher synergistic effects were observed from the plastic mixtures having higher PS content that resulted in increased yield of syngas. Co-gasification of PP-PS blends having 40% PP content (2P3S) exhibited the maximum synergistic effect on H2, CO, and total syngas showing increased yields by 88.8%, 77.7%, and 74.2% respectively. The lowest synergistic effect was observed for HC that showed increased yield of only 25.1%. The optimal CO2 consumption was also observed from the co-gasification of 2P3S. Each gram of 2P3S feedstock consumed approximately 1.80 g of CO2 to result in highest recovered energy of 27.49 kJ/g and the maximum overall energy efficiency of 43.2%. The results revealed that enhanced thermal cracking and CO2 reforming reaction, along with the improved reactivity of carbon black were mainly responsible for increased yields of H2, HC, CO and total syngas during co-gasification. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of co-processing of non-separated waste plastics for enhanced syngas production and energy recovery, elucidating the synergistic effect between the various kinds of plastics during their co-pyrolysis and co-gasification.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and polystyrene waste plastics, with measurable yields of syngas, H2, CO, and HC, along with quantitative synergistic effects and energy efficiency data."
"Insight into the charging methods effects during clean recycling of plastic by co-pyrolysis with low-rank coal Co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and low-rank coal provides a promising method for high-efficiency utilization of them. Previous studies about co-pyrolysis of plastic and low-rank coal mainly concentrated on evenly physical mixture (PM) of feedstock. It has been found that the uneven distribution of materials in the reactor could be caused by the apparent differences in density and property between plastic and coal. In order to investigate the effects of interaction strength between coal and plastic on the thermal behavior and properties of products, a set of co-pyrolysis experiments with different charging methods of one Chinese low-rank coal and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were carried out. To be specific, the charging methods of PM and layered placement (LP), which include charging coal on top of plastic (CT), plastic in the middle of coal like a hamburger (HB) and plastic on top of coal (PT). Results show that, with the same plastic addition ratio, the weight loss of LP co-pyrolysis has almost no reduction compared with that of PM and only one peak is observed from DTG curves instead of two peaks as shown in the theoretical calculated (Cal) curve. It means that there is still an obvious interaction between coal and plastic during co-pyrolysis. Compared to the charge of PM, the tar yield of LP co-pyrolysis decreases slightly while enhances the char yield. The properties of char samples of LP show no noticeable differences as compared that of PM. In term of tar products, co-pyrolysis with HDPE increases the H/C atomic ratio of tar from 1.286 to 1.480 compared to coal pyrolysis alone. However, charging methods make little difference in H/C atom ratio of tar in co-pyrolysis reactions, which is around 1.50. On the other hand, the content of heavy components in tar obtained from LP co-pyrolysis reduces obviously, which is 18.06%, 22.83% and 26.76% for CT, HB and PT, respectively, compared to 36.60% for that of PM. Simultaneously, LP co-pyrolysis can effectively reduce the molecular weight of tar. Additionally, compared to the PM case, the content of H2 and light hydrocarbons (CnHm with n < 5) of LP co-pyrolysis decrease from 10.70% to 7.59% and from 24.56% to 21.67%, respectively. This results from the more effective utilization of H element in the feedstock, especially with the charge of CT. Thus, charging the coal on the top of plastic is a promising method of improving the quality of tar.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste HDPE and low-rank coal with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of tar and char properties."
"Catalytic reforming of polyethylene pyrolysis vapors to naphtha range hydrocarbons with low aromatic content over a high silica ZSM-5 zeolite In this study, the microwave-assisted pyrolysis coupled with ex-situ catalytic reforming of polyethylene for naphtha range hydrocarbons, with low aromatic content, was investigated. Experimental results revealed that ZSM-5 zeolites with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratios led to high aromatic selectivity, while an extremely high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio significantly reduced the aromatic selectivity. The high selectivity of C5-C12 hydrocarbons (98.9 %) with low selectivity of C5-C12 aromatics (28.5 %) was obtained over a high silica ZSM-5 zeolite at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, catalytic cracking temperature of 460 °C, and a weight hourly space velocity of 7 h−1. The liquid oil produced was mainly composed of C5-C12 olefins that can be easily converted into paraffin-rich naphtha by hydrogenation or hydrogen transfer reactions as the feedstock for new plastic manufacturing. 8 cycles of regeneration-reaction cycles were carried out successfully with little change on the product distribution, showing the great potential for continuous production of low-aromatic liquid oil. Catalyst characterization showed that the catalyst deactivation was primarily caused by coke deposition (approximately 16.0 wt%) on the surface of the catalysts, and oxidative regeneration was able to recover most of the pore structure and acidity of the zeolite by effectively removing coke. This study provides a better understanding for the plastic-to-naphtha process and even for scale-up studies.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) with catalytic reforming, reporting measurable yields, product composition, reactor conditions, and catalyst performance."
"The effect of seawater aging on the pyrolysis of fishing nets This study examined the effects of seawater aging on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis behavior of nylon-6 (N6) and polyethylene (PE) using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The analyses revealed an increase in the contents of fixed carbon and ash in both N6 and PE due to aging in seawater for five months. FT-IR spectroscopy indicated an increase in the content of the hydroxyl group in the structures of both aged N6 and PE, suggesting their partial decomposition and oxidation during seawater aging. TGA showed that the maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax) and pyrolysis kinetic parameters of N6, such as the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, were changed by seawater aging. Although the Tmax of PE did not change significantly with seawater aging, the differential thermogravimetric peak shape and kinetic parameters of PE were changed by seawater aging. The isothermal Py-GC/MS results at 600 °C showed that aged N6 produced 3-amino-pentanol in addition to the typical pyrolyzates of fresh N6. Furthermore, the pyrogram of aged PE was similar to that of fresh PE.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (nylon-6 and polyethylene) with measurable experimental data including product composition, thermal behavior, and catalyst-free reactor conditions."
"Thermal degradation of medical plastic waste by in-situ FTIR, TG-MS and TG-GC/MS coupled analyses In this paper, thermal degradation of medical plastic waste (the blends of medicinal plastic bottles and plastic infusion bag) that mainly composed of polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) is studied under both inert and oxidative atmospheres using in-situ FTIR, TG-MS and TG-GC/MS coupled analyses. Meanwhile, the gas evolution profiles as well as the function groups of the decomposition residues during medical plastic waste thermal degradation are also discussed. The aliphatic CH, aromatic CC and aromatic CH exhibit the dramatically vary with temperature, indicating the medical plastic waste begins vitrifying at about 100 °C, starts degrading around 300 °C and reaches to the maximum near 400 °C in inert atmosphere, produces mainly styrene, benzene, toluene, and small amounts of C1–C4 aliphatic hydrocarbons as the initial pyrolysis products. The aromatic compounds are mainly ascribed to PS degradation, and alkanes and alkenes are mainly originated from PP creaking. It is also found that the gaseous evolution profiles are well consistent with DTG curves in terms of appearance of peaks and relevant stages in the whole temperature range. Compared with thermal degradation of medical plastic waste in inert atmosphere, the initial degradation temperature for the medical plastic waste is shifted to lower temperature, while the degradation rate is reduced significantly in the oxidative atmosphere that produces oxygenated hydrocarbons such as acetic acid, phenol and benzoic acid due to the O-atom attack. Lastly, the initial creaking mechanism together with the secondary reaction pathways of the primary volatiles produced from medical plastic waste thermal degradation are also proposed.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of medical plastic waste (PS and PP) using in-situ FTIR, TG-MS, and TG-GC/MS, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Properties assessment of multiwalled carbon nanotubes: A comparative study In the last decade the interest in studies of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from different viewpoints has been constantly increasing. In this work, we have prepared multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE), using cobalt(II) acetate as a catalyst precursor, and then their systematic structural characterization has been carried out in parallel with the commercial MWCNTs (Nanocyl NC3100). For that purpose, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermogravimetry were used. The scanning electron microscopic images (SEM) recorded with different magnification of the synthesized product clearly showed the morphology of the carbon nanotubes. In the diffractogram of the as-prepared MWCNTs, in contrast to the commercial MWCNTs, characteristic peaks for metallic Co were observed besides the typical peaks for graphite. When studying the MWCNTs with Raman spectroscopy, an interesting effect of the laser irradiation on the spectral picture was revealed. In the Raman spectrum of the as-prepared MWCNTs recorded with laser power of 0.111mW the appearance of the bands from cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4) modes clearly demonstrated the oxidation of Co particles from the sample to Co3O4. The infrared spectra of the as-prepared and commercial MWCNTs recorded at room temperature (RT) and at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) are shown and compared. There is no noticeable temperature effect on the spectra appearance in both the frequency and intensity of bands. The TGA and DTG curves for investigated MWCNTs in air atmosphere are presented and the overall results are summarized. The results of TGA showed that up to 350°C, the as-prepared MWCNTs are thermally stable in air, and above this temperature the process of thermo-oxidative decomposition proceeds fast and is completed at around 420°C. The activation energy for the thermal decomposition of the nanotubes is 139kJmol−1.","The study involves pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, in a lab-scale experiment with measurable product characterization and thermal analysis data."
"Microwave-assisted In-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and polystyrene mixtures: Response surface methodology analysis using machine learning Polypropylene (PP) and Polystyrene (PS) are the major plastic fractions found in mixed plastic waste. Hence, the current study was focused to convert PP and PS into useful products via microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). In addition, the understanding of feedstock conversion, product yields, and energy requirements in pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis was investigated. Experiments were conducted at a constant microwave power of 450 W till the reaction temperature reached up to 600 °C. When PS pyrolyzed, a heating rate of 56 °C/min resulted in 80 wt% of oil yield. Whereas PP pyrolysis produced 42 wt% of oil at a heating rate of 76 °C/min. In the PP: PS co-pyrolysis, the heating rate was decreased to 52 °C/min by yielding 51 wt% of oil. In catalytic co-pyrolysis of PP: PS with KOH resulted in variation in product yields and heating rate. An increase in PS quantity at a constant mass of PP resulted in the enhancement of oil yields from 58 to 84 wt% and a decrease in gas yields. The specific microwave power in the catalytic co-pyrolysis (7–18 W/g) is lower compared to the non-catalytic case (22–30 W/g). Whereas, the pyrolysis time in non-catalytic pyrolysis (7–11 min) is lower compared to catalytic co-pyrolysis (14–37 min). The addition of a catalyst resulted in a decrease (23–50%) in microwave conversion efficiency than that of the non-catalytic case (60–85%). The difference in predicted and actual result analysis proved co-pyrolysis synergy in product formation and energy consumption.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics PP and PS, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical data on catalytic performance and energy efficiency."
"Evaluation on isothermal pyrolysis characteristics of typical technical solid wastes Isothermal pyrolysis characteristics of typical technical solid wastes (polyethylene, paper towel and textiles, and their mixture with a blending ratio of 4:1:1) were carried out in a fixed bed between 475 °C and 550 °C. The influence of the temperature on the pyrolysis index, kinetic parameters and products of the samples was addressed. The interaction between the three individuals during their co-pyrolysis was identified. As the temperature was from 475 °C to 550 °C, the pyrolysis index of the polyethylene increased by about 78 times, while that for paper towel and textiles only increased by about 1 and 6 times, respectively. Solid residues from the mixture pyrolysis were about 11.6 % wt. More alkanes and alkenes were in liquid products of the mixture. The shrinking core model would represent well the mixture pyrolysis. The pre-exponential factor of polyethylene was much higher than other two individuals. There was a significant synergistic effect detected for mixture during the co-pyrolysis. The pyrolysis of mixture was dominated by a third order reaction mechanism. This study can provide basic data for the thermal treatment of solid waste in nuclear power plants.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (polyethylene) and other technical solid wastes, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products and kinetics."
"Different reaction behaviours of light or heavy density polyethylene during the pyrolysis with biochar as the catalyst Polyethylene is a major contributor of plastic waste, which can be converted into liquid fuel via catalytic pyrolysis. In this study, the pyrolysis of light or heavy density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and their mixture with the biochar produced from gasification of poplar wood as catalyst was investigated. The results showed that, during the co-pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE in absence or presence of biochar catalyst, cross-interaction of reaction intermediates originated from the degradation of LDPE and HDPE substantially promoted the formation of gaseous products and the evolution of heavy organics with π-conjugated structures in the tar. During the pyrolysis of HDPE, more heavy tar while less wax was produced, while it was contrary during the pyrolysis of LDPE. In the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE, the volatiles could be effectively cracked over the biochar catalyst, forming more gases, while in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, instead of catalyzing the cracking of the heavy components, the biochar catalyzed the polymerisation reactions. The properties of the biochar catalyst in terms of crystallinity, surface functionality, and internal structures also changed remarkably due to the transfer of oxygen-containing species from the polyethylene to biochar and the interaction of biochar with volatiles in the pyrolysis.","The study investigates catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics LDPE and HDPE using biochar as a catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature effects, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Product distribution modelling in the thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene The thermal fast pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor in the 450–715°C range, and individual products have been monitored with the aim of obtaining kinetic data for the design and simulation of this process at large scale. Kinetic schemes have been proposed in order to explain both the results obtained in the laboratory plant and those obtained in the literature by other authors operating at laboratory and larger scale. Discrimination has been carried out based on the contribution of the variance of model parameters (stepwise regression) to the total variance explained by the model. The models based on that of Westerhout et al. [R.W.J. Westerhout, J. Waanders, W.P.M. Van Swaaij, Recycling of polyethene and polypropene in a novel bench-scale rotating cone reactor by high-temperature pyrolysis. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 37 (6) (1998) 2293–2300] do not adequately predict the experimental results, especially those corresponding to aromatics and char, which is probably due to the very short residence times attained in the conical spouted bed and, consequently, to the lower yields of aromatics and char. The model of best fit is the one where polyethylene degrades to give gas, liquid (oil) and wax fractions. Furthermore, the latter undergoes secondary reactions to give liquid and aromatics, which in turn produce more char.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor with measured product yields and kinetic analysis, including oil, gas, char, and wax distribution."
"Degradation of waste High-density polyethylene into fuel oil using basic catalyst High-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been degraded thermally and catalytically using MgCO3 at 450°C into liquid fraction in a batch reactor. Different conditions like temperature, time and catalyst ratio were optimized for the maximum conversion of HDPE into liquid fraction. Catalytic degradation yielded 92% liquid fraction whereas 90% wax was obtained with thermal degradation. The composition of the liquid fraction was characterized by physicochemical properties of petroleum fuel tests. The catalytic liquid fraction consisted of high concentration of C8–C9, C13–C14 and C17–C18 hydrocarbons. The distillation data showed that ∼50% of the fraction has boiling point in the range of gasoline and ∼50% in the range of diesel oil.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE in a batch reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and optimized reaction conditions."
"Catalytic upcycling of post-consumer multilayered plastic packaging wastes for the selective production of monoaromatic hydrocarbons In order to obtain extended storage life of food-grade materials and better barrier properties against environmental factors, a multilayer plastic packaging (MLP) is often used. The multilayer packaging plastics are labelled as “other” (SPI#7) category, and are manufactured with a combination of barrier plastics, rigid plastics and printing surface. Owing to their complex composition and difficulty in separating the layers of MLP, its mechanical recycling is challenging. In this study, MLP wastes (MLPWs) were collected from zero-waste garbage collection center of IIT Madras, India, and thoroughly characterized to determine their composition and plastic types. MLPWs were characterized using various physico-chemical methods such as thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, and proximate and ultimate analyses. The MLPWs were mainly made up of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Further, the non-catalytic and zeolite-catalyzed fast pyrolysis of these MLPWs were studied using analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS). The non-catalytic fast pyrolysis of MLPWs primarily produced a mixture of aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, while zeolite catalyzed fast pyrolysis resulted in the formation of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). The activity of HZSM-5, zeolite Y (HY) and zeolite beta (Hβ) catalysts were evaluated, and the salient products were quantified. The yields of MAHs like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene using the zeolites followed the trend: HZSM-5 (14.9 wt%) > HY (8.1 wt%) > Hβ (7.8 wt%), at 650 °C. The use of HZSM-5 resulted in highest yield of MAHs, viz. 16.1 wt%, at the optimum temperature of 550 °C and MLPW-to-catalyst ratio of 1:15 (w/w). The superior activity of HZSM-5 is due to its nominal acidity and larger pore size of 4.24 nm, as compared to HY and Hβ. The MAHs yield from three other types of MLPWs varied in the range of 9–16 wt%. The present study demonstrates a promising pathway for the catalytic upcycling of highly heterogeneous MLPWs in the context of circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of multilayer plastic waste, with measurable yields of monoaromatic hydrocarbons and detailed experimental characterization using Py-GC/MS, TGA, FTIR, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Low-temperature microwave co-pyrolysis of medical waste and walnut shells: effective regulation of organic chlorine to inorganic chlorine conversion in pyrolyzed char To regulate the migration and transformation of chlorine in the pyrolysis process of medical waste, this study utilized microwave pyrolysis technology for co-pyrolyzing medical gloves (MG) with walnut shells (WS). Furthermore, we innovatively combined microwave thermogravimetry to explore the migration and transformation mechanisms of chlorine under varying temperatures and mix ratios. Under microwave pyrolysis alone, the chlorine in MG mainly existed in the form of HCl and organic chlorine in oil. When WS was added, the chlorine element in HCl migrated to the char, while the organic chlorine in the char was converted to inorganic chlorine. Under optimal microwave co-pyrolysis conditions, the chlorine content in pyrolysis oil decreased to ∼5 %, while chlorine fixation by pyrolysis char reached 65.63 mg/g, a 35.45 mg/g increase compared to MG pyrolysis alone. Through the characterization of pyrolysis char, it was found that the metal oxides in WS could absorb HCl and immobilize it in the form of metal chlorides in the char, thus effectively reducing the generation of HCl. This study successfully achieved efficient fixation of chlorine while improving the quality of pyrolysis oil and gas, which provides a new idea for the thermal treatment and resource recycling of PVC-containing medical waste.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of medical waste (containing PVC) and walnut shells, with measurable product yields, chlorine content in oil and char, and characterization of pyrolysis products and mechanisms."
"Upcycling of post-industrial multilayer plastic packaging waste through gasoline-equivalent hydrocarbon-targeted pyrolysis by an environmentally friendly catalyst This study’s novelty lies in investigating the performance of calcined cement kiln dust (CCKD) as a new, low-cost catalyst in the flash pyrolysis of EVOH-containing multilayer plastic packaging waste (MLPW). An analytical pyrolyzer, connected with gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection (Py–GC/MS), was employed to investigate the catalytic pyrolysis of MLPW. Py-GC/MS experiments have shown that condensable volatiles from catalytic pyrolysis of MLPW exhibit higher yields of aromatics (24.7 %) and cyclic aliphatic compounds (26.3 %). The catalytic pyrolysis of MLPW yields C5–C12 hydrocarbons (76.2 %), while the non-catalytic conversion yields C8–C24 hydrocarbons (95.4 %). These results underscore the efficacy of catalytic pyrolysis in recovering gasoline-range hydrocarbons from MLPW, selectively enhancing the yield of cyclic aliphatics and aromatic compounds. Thus, within the circular economy’s horizon, flash pyrolysis can be scaled up to process large amounts of MLPW using CCKD as a low-cost catalyst, converting MLPW into a potential gasoline-range transportation fuel.",The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of post-industrial multilayer plastic packaging waste using a real reactor system with measurable product yields and composition analysis via Py-GC/MS.
"Simultaneous pretreatment and catalytic conversion of polyolefins into hydrocarbon fuels over acidic zeolite catalysts The effect of pre-degradation treatment in catalytic pyrolysis of polymer was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis reactor experiments of different polymers on various catalysts. Intimate contact between the polymer and catalyst was achieved using physical, mechanical and thermal treatments. The results from the TGA analysis show that pre-degradation treatment has greatly improved the performance of the catalyst attaining maximum degradation at lower temperature. Pre-degradation treatment had increased the liquid yield and lowered the coke yield at various extents depending on the catalyst structure and acidity. The ZSM-5 catalyst with high Si/Al ratio showed maximum amount of (C5–C9) and ZSM-5 with lower Si/Al ratio has maximum percentage of (C14–C20). Based on the performance of the pre-degradation treatment methods, normal mixing produced the maximum amount of lighter fractions and therefore pre-degradation treatment can serve to enhance the gasoline fraction while the diesel fraction can be optimised using the co-pressing method, where polymer and catalyst particles were thoroughly mixed and co-pressed together into mixed particles. Coke characterisation showed coke formed by linear low density polyethylene contained more volatile coke components while polypropylene coke had higher percentage of hard coke. ZSM-5 had lower retention of coke components with volatile coke precursors. The volatility of the coke increases while coke concentration and decreases as the catalyst amount decreases. Pre-degradation treatment facilitated the formation of soft coke components that are easy to remove in inert atmosphere.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins (plastics) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis using experimental methods."
"Thermal decomposition of polyolefin/carbon black composites The thermal decomposition of carbon black composites with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyisobutylene (PIB) has been studied in order to clarify the influence of carbon black on the thermal behavior of polymers in inert atmosphere. The thermal stability of the composites and mixtures has been monitored by thermogravimetry, whereas the decomposition product distribution of the composites has been determined by pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Using various types of carbon blacks, it has been established that the effect depends on the volatile content of the carbon blacks. Carbon black of high volatile content is able to initiate the decomposition of PP and PIB, whereas carbon blacks of low volatile content increase the thermal stability of the polymers. Carbon blacks affect the product distribution of polymers, the magnitude of the changes increases with increasing volatile content of the carbon black. Lower amount of α,ω-alkadienes and more n-alkanes are released from PE/carbon black composite indicating the occurrence of a hydrogenation process. The intensity of the 1-alkene oligomers of PP is reduced, while several other products are formed during thermal decomposition of PP/carbon black composites. The product distribution indicates that carbon black participates in the hydrogen transfer reactions. Enhanced monomer evolution and hindered oligomer formation are observed in PIB that can be explained by a chain end initiation reaction in the presence of carbon black.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PIB) with carbon black, includes experimental characterization (pyrolysis–GC/MS), and reports measurable product distribution and yield changes."
"Isothermal pyrolysis and gasification characteristics and gas products of ethylene vinyl acetate and back sheets in end-of-life photovoltaic module thermal treatment recovery Removing the back sheets (TPT, Tedlar / Polyethylene terephthalate / Tedlar) and encapsulants (EVA, ethylene vinyl acetate) through pyrolysis is a promising method for the efficient recycling of photovoltaic cells. A self-developed isothermal thermogravimetric analyzer was used to study the TPT and EVA pyrolysis characteristics as well as their gas products. Based on the release behavior of the gas products, a novel release pathway for CO2 during EVA pyrolysis was proposed. EVA pyrolysis with no residue at 450 °C in the 20 % O2 atmosphere within 30 min, making it possible to recycle PV materials with low energy consumption. TPT showed a two-stage characteristic in 20 % O2 and the residual from the first stage of TPT pyrolysis was able to be oxidized in the second reaction stage. The main gas products generated by the isothermal pyrolysis of EVA were CO2, C3H6, and CH4. Reusing the gas products was worthwhile since their lower calorific value reached 57.60 MJ/Nm3. The primary gas products of TPT pyrolysis were CO2, CH4, and C2H4. Different from temperature programmed pyrolysis, part of the acetyl groups in EVA formed CO2 directly but not acetic acid at high temperatures, and the CO2 release continued the whole isothermal pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale isothermal pyrolysis of waste plastics EVA and TPT, with measurable product yields, gas composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Double-function synergistic treatment system: Mask-biochar package for methylene blue adsorption and high-quality bioproducts recovery via pyrolysis in wastewater treatment and fuel production Waste disposable masks cause serious environmental pollution due to their slow degradation. This study investigated a simple and efficient method to recycle masks for high-value additional utilization. Polypropylene-based waste masks were dismantled and combined with Enteromorpha clathrate biochar (AC) to produce mask-biochar packages (M-AC), which were applied to wastewater (containing methylene blue) treatment. The results showed that compared with AC alone, the removal rate of MB solution by mask-biochar packages (M-AC) increased by 18.50 %. Then, the used mask-biochar packages (M-AC) were pyrolyzed at 550 °C to obtain hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil and composite biochar (MAC). Compared to MAC alone, the mask-biochar package (M-MAC) increased the removal rate of MB by 10.16 %. The composite biochar has achieved a high adsorption capacity of 820.925 mg·g−1 without any activator and acid washing process.

"Asphalt pyro-rejuvenators based on waste tyres: An approach to improve the rheological and self-healing properties of aged binders Waste Tyres (WT) are a significant fraction of industrial waste and a source of environmental hazards with limited valorisation. To reduce this problem, currently there is a growing interest in valuing the WT through pyrolysis to obtain multifunctional liquids to improve the rheological and self-healing properties of aged binders. This research provides a comprehensive study on using WT mixtures as precursors for asphalt rejuvenators by means of pyrolysis and distillation processes. To this end, WT polymeric fractions from light (WT-L) and mining trucks (WT-M) were used as feedstock and characterised for compositional and thermal properties. Additionally, micropyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) was used to identify the major products in pyrolysis vapours, to elucidate the reaction maps describing thermal degradation of WTs and to predict the feasible reaction conditions. The pyrolysis liquids were produced after a screening of reaction conditions and subjected to distillation, following a response surface model to produce an optimised pyro-rejuvenator. The results showed that the pyrolytic rejuvenator obtained through pyrolysis at 465 °C and distillation cutting at 160–200 °C is mainly composed of hydrocarbons and aromatic substances (95.5%), with a significant proportion of limonene (33.71%). Furthermore, the pyrolytic rejuvenator exhibited highly desirable physical properties in the context of its application and excellent oxidative stability (85.7%). Otherwise, it was determined that bitumen mixtures with 3%–6% doses of pyro-rejuvenator improved the viscosity, softening point, and penetration of aged binders, restoring their physical properties to the virgin state. In conclusion, pyro-rejuvenators can be successfully used as a promising solution to produce more durable and sustainable pavements with improved rheological and healing properties.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tyres (a type of plastic waste) with measurable yields, product composition analysis via Py-GC-MS, and optimization of reactor conditions, yielding data on rejuvenator composition and performance in asphalt applications."
"Catalytic flash pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor for recovery of fuel-like hydrocarbons Products obtained in the flash pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor, in thermal and catalytic conditions (HZSM-5 or HUSY 20% by weight) at four different temperatures (in the range 500–800°C) have been analyzed in this work focusing on the liquid fraction. The results obtained showed significant differences between condensable compounds generated in presence and absence of catalysts. The liquid fraction obtained without catalyst was composed principally by linear paraffins (C10–C40) and almost no generation of aromatic compounds was observed. The presence of low amounts of zeolite (HZSM-5 or HUSY) led to a significant reduction of the saturated and unsaturated condensable hydrocarbons, while it favored the formation of aromatics and branched paraffins. Compared with the results reached with HZSM-5 zeolite, HUSY produces higher amount of aromatics and branched alkanes and a narrower distribution of products, independently of the pyrolysis temperature. The reactor employed in this work was a fluidized bed reactor, very similar to that used in generation of gasoline-range hydrocarbons at large scale, which allows to illustrate a very useful method for the recovery of these hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic flash pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Jet fuel and hydrogen produced from waste plastics catalytic pyrolysis with activated carbon and MgO Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to produce jet fuel and hydrogen using activated carbon and MgO as catalysts was studied. The effects of catalyst to waste plastics ratio experimental temperature, catalyst placement and activated carbon to MgO ratio on the yields and distributions of pyrolysis products were studied. The placement of catalysts played an important role on the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE, and the pyrolytic volatiles first flowing through MgO and then biomass-derived activated carbon (BAC) could obtain an excellent result to produce H2 and jet fuel-rich products. The higher pyrolysis temperature converted diesel range alkanes into jet fuel range alkanes and promoted the aromatization of alkanes to generate aromatic hydrocarbons. BAC and MgO as catalysts had excellent performance in catalytic conversion of LDPE to produce hydrogen and jet fuel. 100 area.% jet fuel range products can be obtained in LDPE catalytic pyrolysis under desired experimental conditions. The combination of BAC and MgO as catalysts had a synergy effect on the gaseous product distribution and promoted the production of hydrogen, and up to 94.8 vol% of the obtained gaseous components belonged to hydrogen. This work provided an effective, convenient and economical pathway to produce jet fuel and hydrogen from waste plastics.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions, using activated carbon and MgO catalysts in lab-scale experiments."
"Optimization of microwave power and graphite susceptor quantity for waste polypropylene microwave pyrolysis Microwave power and the susceptor quantity are important operating parameters in the microwave-assisted pyrolysis. This work aims at finding the optimal power and susceptor quantity from a discrete set of microwave powers (300 W, 450 W, and 600 W) and graphite susceptor quantity (50 g, 200 g, and 350 g) to pyrolyze waste polypropylene. The effect of microwave power and the susceptor quantity on heating rate, conversion efficiency, and heat losses in pyrolysis were analyzed using a central composite design (CCD). It was observed that a higher microwave power and lower susceptor quantity yielded higher heating rates, and lower heating rates were obtained for a lower microwave power and higher susceptor quantity. For example, a very low heating rate, averaging to 8.5 °C/min was obtained for a low microwave power (300 W) and a high susceptor quantity (350 g), whereas high values of heating rate (71.7 °C/min) were obtained for a microwave power of 600 W with 50 g of susceptor quantity. For a set of microwave powers considered in this study, it was observed that the required bed temperatures were acquired faster at a low susceptor quantity compared to high susceptor quantity. The oil produced from the pyrolysis of WPP has a high heating value of 44 MJ/kg and the carbon number distribution in the range of C8 to C12. The char produced has rich carbon content (96 wt.%) and a high specific surface area (195 m2/g). Cyclo alkenes with a selectivity of 70% and monocyclic hydrocarbons with a selectivity of 49.6 % were produced at 450 W and 600 W powers respectively for a susceptor quantity of 50 g. From this study, it is found that the microwave power and susceptor quantity are the important parameters for minimizing the microwave energy requirement in the pyrolysis. The low susceptor quantity and high microwave power were found to be the best for achieving fast heating rates and low energy requirements. The microwave power significantly playing a vital role in the polypropylene pyrolysis product spectrum for value-added hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of waste polypropylene with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization of oil, char, and product composition."
"Valorizing municipal solid waste: Waste to energy and activated carbons for water treatment via pyrolysis Globally, as societies urbanize and demand for energy increases, the need to manage mounting quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW), produce renewable energy, and insure clean water supplies becomes more pressing each year. These issues could be addressed by integrating pyrolysis of MSW to recover liquid and gaseous biofuels and a solid biochar, with CO2 activation of the latter to produce activated biochars for water treatment. This potential conversion pathway is experimentally demonstrated by pyrolyzing a model MSW stream at 408 °C, the peak mass loss rate pyrolysis temperature and compared to pyrolysis at 900 °C. As pyrolysis temperature increases, we see conversion of plastic intermediaries into paraffins and polycyclic aromatic compounds, though the desirable gas components (methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide) of the pyrolysis gas increase substantially. The CO2 activated biochars (activated at 600 °C and 900 °C) show surface areas over 300 m2/g, with the lower pyrolysis temperature and higher activation temperature yielding the highest areas. Adsorption experiments were performed with methylene blue to determine the ability of the activated MSW-biochar to remove organic pollutants from water. Adsorption is well described by the Langmuir isotherm, with equilibrium adsorption capacities upwards of 250 mgdye/g for all activated biochars.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal solid waste containing plastic waste, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products and activated carbons."
"The effect of co-pyrolysis of bamboo waste and polypropylene on biomass deoxygenation and carbonization processes While numerous research studies have delved into the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, limited attention has been devoted to comprehending the interaction mechanism that impacts biomass deoxygenation and carbonization. Therefore, this study explores the co-effect of temperature and polypropylene blending ratio on co-pyrolysis reaction kinetics, distribution of oxygenates/hydrocarbons, as well as the evolution of biochar structure. At a blending ratio of 0.5, the co-pyrolysis exhibits the lowest activation energy (146 kJ/mol), approximately 25.1 % lower than that required for individual pyrolysis. The interaction between bamboo waste with polypropylene increases the O-abstraction process, resulting in the creation of O-containing free radicals and hydrocarbon compounds. The peak proportion of aromatic compounds, reaching approximately 69.5 %, is observed at 700 °C when the blending ratio is 0.5. The H-abstraction process converts large-molecular alkanes into H free radicals and tiny-molecular unsaturated hydrocarbons. The aliphatic functional group content diminishes as the polypropylene ratio increases. The maximum specific surface area (7.70 m2/g) and pore volume (21.7 mm3/g) are achieved at a blending ratio of 0.75. Notably, polypropylene exerts minimal influence on the graphite crystallite size and graphitization degree of biochar. This research significantly contributes to advancing our understanding of the interaction mechanisms between biomass and plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (plastic) and bamboo waste (biomass) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst-free reaction kinetics, and analytical characterization of biochar and product composition."
"The role of carbon dioxide in hydrocarbon conversion during catalytic pyrolysis of plastic mixture over Ni catalyst Pyrolysis converts plastic waste to fuel range hydrocarbons (HCs) and industrial chemicals but requires high purity polyolefin waste. However, practical plastic waste is a heterogeneous mixture, enabling a limited amount of high purity plastic recycling. Pyrolysis of mixed plastic produces low quality plastic oil, necessitating a series of refining processes to obtain low yield of target chemicals. In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis can directly convert mixed plastic into higher value syngas, but rapid catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition is a problem. In this study, a sustainable platform for mixed plastic to syngas was developed by introducing Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst and CO2 as a feedstock gas. Volatile HCs evolved from pyrolysis of plastic were decomposed over Ni catalyst to produce shorter chained HCs and H2, but catalyst deactivation was shown by carbon deposition under N2. When CO2 was introduced, HCs were further converted into syngas (H2 and CO) by catalytic reactions with CO2, suppressing carbon deposition on catalyst. The best yield of gaseous products from catalytic pyrolysis of a polypropylene was 377 % at 650 °C under CO2, which was more than 7 times higher gas yield under N2. When heterogeneous plastic mixture was used as a reactant, the same trend was shown, and the presence of aromatic plastics in plastic mixture increased the yield of aromatic compounds. This study experimentally demonstrated that low quality plastic mixture and CO2 could be simultaneously converted into syngas by catalytic pyrolysis with suppression of carbon deactivation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste using Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and CO2, with measurable product yields and analytical characterization of syngas and aromatic compounds."
"High-temperature liquefaction of waste plastics High-temperature liquefaction of commingled post-consumer plastics obtained from the American Plastics Council was studied. The liquefaction reaction was carried out in a tubing bomb micro-reactor with operating temperatures of ∼500°C, hydrogen pressures of ∼790kkPa cold and reaction times of 0–30 min. These high temperatures were used to reduce the residence time required for liquefaction. Reactions were carried out in the absence of catalysts. Total conversion and conversions to asphaltenes, oil, gas and coke were monitored. Total conversion as high as 100% was achieved. Gas yields up to 70% and oil yields as high as 60% were obtained. The kinetics of liquefaction of these waste materials was studied. Maximum yield of liquid product was obtained at ∼500°C and ∼5–10 min reaction time.","The study involves high-temperature liquefaction of commingled post-consumer plastics in a micro-reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and reaction conditions, satisfying all criteria for plastic pyrolysis, lab-scale experimentation, and extractable data."
"Secondary reactions in the analysis of microplastics by analytical pyrolysis Mixtures of plastic particles of different types were analysed by Py-GC-MS in order to investigate the effect of polymer interactions on the composition of pyrolysates. Pyrolysis products associated to secondary reactions were observed when particles of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) were pyrolysed in the presence of poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) and the polyamides PA6 (polycaproamide) and PA66 (poly(hexamethylene adipamide)). Co-pyrolysis of PET in the presence of PVC particles produced mono and dichloroethyl esters of terephthalic acid due to the addition of HCl to the double bond of the vinyl group. Benzyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, 4-chlorobenzoic acid were also tentatively identified. The interaction between PET and PA6 and above all PA66 brought about the formation of aromatic nitriles including methyl and ethyl benzonitrile, 1,4-benzenedicarbonitrile, 4-cyanoethyl benzoate, 4-cyano benzoic acid. In addition, co-pyrolysis of PET and PA66 particles produced N-alkyl amides of benzoic acid. Pyrolysis of benzoic acid generated benzene and diphenyl, while N-hexylbenzamide was observed from the pyrolysis of benzoic acid with hexyl-1-amine or hexan-1,6-diamine. PE (polyethylene), PP (polypropylene), PS (polystyrene) and PVC did not exhibit significant interactions. Calibration curves built up with single plastic types in the 10–120 µg range were used to quantify each polymer in the mixture using typical pyrolytic markers. The highest deviations of recovery and the lowest RSD were observed for PET and PA6, while polyolefins produced satisfactory recovery and RSD. The detection of pyrolysis products from secondary reactions can be used as markers for the co-presence of different polymers supporting their identification.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PET, PVC, PA6, PA66) with measurable product yields, catalyst-free reactions, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products using GC–MS."
"Factorial design application to evaluate thermochemical conversion of shredder residues Among the different wastes generated by steel industry, there is the shredder residue (SR). SR is a highly heterogeneous mixture, which is most commonly destined to a landfill of industrial waste by the Brazilian steel industry. Considering the high variation of its composition, the use of statistical tools is recommended to obtain consistent data. Pyrolysis can be considered a solution to dispose of this residue. This work aimed at evaluating the SR pyrolysis process using a 2k factorial design. The following variables were investigated: temperature, heating rate, inert gas (N2) flow rate, and CaO/SR ratio. Lower heating rate resulted in higher non-condensable gas yields (>50% w/w). CaO was efficient for CO2 capture in non-condensable gas, thus increasing calorific value. Higher heating rate resulted in higher condensable vapor yields, and the main compound found in this stream was styrene. The thermochemical conversion process, through pyrolysis, presented high potential for SR reuse rather than the disposal in landfills.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of shredder residues, a waste plastic mixture, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Gasoline and diesel-like fuel production by continuous catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and polypropylene mixtures over USY zeolite Catalytic degradation of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and their mixtures with different proportions (20:80, 50:50, and 80:20) using USY zeolite, was studied in a continuous pilot plant at 500 °C, with a plastic/catalyst ratio of 10:1. The liquid fraction derived from the catalytic pyrolysis of PP and that of PE was dominated by a (C5–C7) hydrocarbons fraction, while the gaseous products for both materials were dominated by C3 and C4. Based on the Gas chromatography analysis and the distillation curves, no synergetic effect was observed for different mixture compositions. As pyrolysis products of PP and PE cover a wide range of hydrocarbons, a separation into different fractions was suggested before using them as fuels. The separation temperatures were optimized and it was found that 160 °C is the temperature at which the boiling point distribution and physical properties of light fraction of both PP and PE products can be compatible with gasoline fuel norms, and 220 °C is the temperature at which heavy fractions are compatible with diesel fuel norms. Since there is no interaction between plastics during reaction, the oil derivate from a 50%-50% mixture of PP-PE has been separated at the same temperatures and its characteristics lie between that of PP and PE. Despite that the obtained gasoline-like fraction, which represents 49% of the total oil of the 50%-50% mixture of PP-PE has a very low content in aromatics, it presents a relatively high octane number (RON = 89.8). While the diesel-like fraction which represents 20% of the total oil has a cetane number of 45.1. Finally, from 1 kg of PP for example, having an energy content of 46.4 MJ, 34.3 MJ of liquid and 8.8 MJ of gas were produced. The gasoline-like phase has an energy content of 18 MJ, the intermediate phase possesses an energetic content of 10.7 MJ while the diesel-like phase having an energy content of 6.7 MJ, could generate an electrical energy of 0.53 kWh.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and polypropylene mixtures in a continuous pilot plant, with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and analytical characterization of hydrocarbon fractions."
"Dual-control strategy for selective upgrading of polyethylene waste into jet fuel-range alkanes Selective conversion of polyethylene (PE) waste into liquid fuels remains challenging due to uncontrolled C–C bond cleavage and broad product distributions. Here, we propose a dual-control strategy that couples thermodynamically decoupled tandem catalysis with rational Ru-based catalyst design to improve carbon efficiency and fuel selectivity. A two-stage pressurized fixed-bed reactor was developed, where PE undergoes high-temperature hydropyrolysis followed by gas-phase hydrogenolysis of olefinic intermediates. Compared with pyrolysis or hydrogenolysis alone (<50 % selectivity to C8–C16 n-alkanes), the optimized 0.5Ru/Co3O4 catalyst delivered 85.1 % selectivity and 72.9 wt% yield of C8–C16 n-alkanes from real PE medical waste, while keeping gas yield below 12 wt%. Unlike conventional Ru catalysts that promote terminal bond cleavage and excessive gas formation, the synergy between small Ru clusters and redox-active Co3O4 favors selective hydrogenation–cleavage cycles at internal C–C bonds, suppressing over-cracking. This energy-efficient route minimizes carbon losses, offers potential scalability for recycling PE waste into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons, and contributes to carbon reduction and the circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real polyethylene waste in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product selectivity, and catalyst performance data."
"Microwave-coupled recycling of plastic waste into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes over economical iron-based catalyst Recycling plastic waste via chemical treatment is a promising strategy that continuously contributes to a sustainable world while is frequently limited by high energy consumption and the use of expensive catalysts. Herein, an economical Fe–Fe3C@C catalyst has been developed using fast microwave-based synthesis methods, the catalyst can efficiently and powerfully convert plastic waste into high-purity hydrogen (H2) and value-added carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under microwave irradiation. Results indicate that H2 yields reached significantly high levels of 69.4 mmol g-1 plastic, 70.7 mmol g-1 plastic, 71.2 mmol g-1 plastic and 37.2 mmol g-1 plastic when treating LDPE, HDPE, PP and PS waste, respectively, achieving almost 100% hydrogen efficiency, together with high CNTs purity of 94.9% in the resulting carbonaceous. Importantly, this microwave catalysis also reduces energy consumption by over 85% compared to traditional thermal catalysis, indicating a new breakthrough, more economical and highly valuable future for plastic waste management.","The study involves microwave-coupled pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP, PS) with measurable H2 yields, CNT production, and catalyst performance data."
"Pyrolysis and catalytic reforming of disposable plastic waste for syngas production with adjustable H2/CO ratio The gasification technology has shown great potential to upcycle plastic waste for clean and high-value fuel. Gasification of disposable plastic masks was investigated in a two-stage pyrolysis-catalytic reforming system, aiming at producing the syngas with flexible H2 to CO ratio which can be tuned for various downstream applications without further purification and adjustment. To maximize the syngas yield and minimize the carbon deposition, different gasifying agents in the staged catalytic process was explored. The results showed that CO2 significantly promoted syngas production mainly by increasing CO yield. However, H2-rich syngas was obtained via using steam as the gasifying agent. Competitive and synergistic relationships between CO2 and H2O agent at co-feeding process were further revealed. CO2 facilitated the reforming of H2O at low dose of steam while exhibiting a main competition with adequate steam except for synergy at 5 mL/min CO2 flow rate. An optimum H2-rich syngas yield of 135.59 mmol/gplastic with H2/CO ratio of 2 was obtained at co-feeding reactants. Therefore, the co-feeding of H2O and CO2 could show positive effect for both coke removal and syngas quality regulation. Results found in this work increased the overall operational flexibility and economy of pyrolysis and catalytic reforming of plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis and catalytic reforming of disposable plastic waste with measurable syngas yields, H2/CO ratios, and catalyst performance data."
"Synergistic effect of biomass and polyurethane waste co-pyrolysis on soot formation at high temperatures Soot is an important toxic pollutant generated during high-temperature incineration of solid waste (i.e., biomass and plastic waste) under air-lean conditions, and has a great impact on flame radiation. The main objective of this work is to study the synergistic effect of biomass and polyurethane co-pyrolysis on soot formation at high temperatures (1100–1250 °C). The effects of temperature, biomass species, and co-pyrolysis ratio on the yield, morphology, composition and reactivity of soot particles are studied. Results show that under controlled co-pyrolysis conditions, the measured soot yield from co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyurethane is lower than the theoretical value by weight average, while the particle size distribution tends to concentrate on a smaller diameter range. The degree of synergistic effect increases with the increasing biomass ratio (0–50 wt%) and decreasing pyrolysis temperature. Wood in co-pyrolysis presents a stronger synergistic effect on soot yields than straw co-pyrolysis does. Degree of synergistic effect on soot oxidation reactivity depends much on the biomass addition ratio but less on pyrolysis temperature. At 10 wt% straw addition ratio, co-pyrolysis exerts a negative synergistic effect on soot oxidation reactivity, while the synergistic effect turns significantly positive when the straw addition ratio increases to 50 wt%.","The study involves pyrolysis of polyurethane waste with biomass at high temperatures, with measured soot yields, particle size distribution, and synergistic effects analyzed under varying conditions."
"Recycled PMMA prepared directly from crude MMA obtained from thermal depolymerization of mixed PMMA waste Recycled PMMA was prepared by directly polymerizing crude pyrolysis oils from lab-scale pyrolysis of collected industrial waste PMMA. The pyrolysis oils consisted mainly of methyl methacrylate (MMA, >85%), while the type and number of by-products from the thermal process were assigned through GC–MS analysis showing a clear correlation to the pyrolysis temperature. By-products can be removed by distillation; however, directly employing the crude oils to prepare PMMA through solution, suspension, emulsion, or casting polymerization was investigated to assess the potential for omitting this costly step. It was found that the crude pyrolysis oils could be polymerized efficiently via solution, emulsion, and casting polymerization to produce a polymer similar to the PMMA prepared from a pristine monomer. The impurities in the PMMAs prepared from the crude mixtures were investigated by extraction analyses followed by screening by GC–MS. In the case of casting polymerization, the GC–MS analysis, as expected, revealed various residual by-products, while solution and emulsion polymerization showed only very few impurities, mainly originating from the polymerization and not the feed material. Additional purification of the crude pyrolysis oils would be required for applications in casting polymerization. In contrast, direct polymerization by emulsion or solution polymerization is considered applicable for producing pristine PMMA from crude waste PMMA pyrolysis oil.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed industrial waste PMMA, with measurable product yields, GC–MS analysis of by-products, and characterization of resulting PMMA from crude pyrolysis oil."
"Catalytic upgrading of polyethylene plastic waste using GMOF catalyst: Morphology, pyrolysis, and product analysis Since 2000, global plastic waste production and consumption have doubled, escalating from 250 to 500 million tonnes. Merely 9 % of plastic waste undergoes global recycling, leaving the majority either in landfills or poorly managed. This research introduces a new catalyst, GMOF, created by growing Metal-Organic Framework (MOFs) rods on the flaked, carpet-like structure of Graphene Oxide (GO) nanosheets. The aim is to enhance the quality of pyrolysis products derived from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste using this GMOF catalyst. HDPE and LDPE, sourced from post-consumer plastic packaging, underwent specific treatment involving cleaning, drying, and shredding. Morphological and property evaluations of GO nanosheets before and after MOF decoration employed techniques including Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Flash pyrolysis at 500 °C for 1 min using a sample-to-catalyst ratio of 4:1 in a Quartz Wool Matrix (QWM) reactor was conducted via a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Frontier LAB pyrolizers. Thermal stability and characteristics of feedstocks and catalysts were assessed using TGA. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) analyzed and quantified pyrolysis product compounds, while a Micro GC Fusion system determined non-condensable pyrolyzate permanent gas distribution. Results showcased that the GMOF catalyst's unique morphology efficiently captured smaller radicals on its surface, providing increased surface area for effective radical–radical interactions during pyrolysis. In HDPE pyrolysis, the GMOF catalyst notably decreased selectivity of C21-C40 and C40 + wax fractions to 49.07 % and 7.73 %, respectively, while boosting C1-C20 olefin production by 2.54 %. Conversely, LDPE pyrolysis with the GMOF catalyst notably amplified the CO2 peak intensity by 3.17 %, signifying a gasification phase. Primary gases produced were C3 aliphatic hydrocarbons, propane, and propylene, yielding 79.46 % collectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste HDPE and LDPE plastics using a GMOF catalyst, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including GC–MS and Micro GC Fusion."
"Investigation of the effect of alumina porous media on the polyethylene waste pyrolysis with continuous feed This study investigates the pyrolysis of polyethylene waste in a continuous-feed mode to provide novel insights into recycling waste plastics. Alumina (Al2O3) porous media has been introduced into the pyrolysis reactor to study its effect on continuous-feeding plastic waste pyrolysis. The pyrolysis product yields, oil fractions, and gas components have been determined under varying porous media structures, i.e., thickness and pore size, and operating parameters, i.e., temperature and gas-carrying velocity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to investigate the influence of porous media pore size on the thermal decomposition of waste polyolefin in continuous feeding mode. The results reveal that higher thicknesses and smaller pore sizes of porous media can enhance the properties of pyrolysis oil with lower heavy fractions (>C20). The aromatization of light olefins is triggered when the temperature exceeds 520 °C, resulting in a rapid increase in light fraction (<C12) in pyrolysis oil. Moreover, the gas-carrying velocity determines the pyrolysis product distribution by regulating the volatiles' residence time.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene waste with measurable product yields, oil fractions, gas components, and temperature–yield relationships under varying reactor conditions and catalyst (alumina porous media) structures."
"Upgradation, product analysis and engine performance of hydrocarbon fuels produced through pyrolysis of thermoplastic polymers with Si and ZSM-5 modified catalysts Waste plastic mitigation is one of the major concerns for achieving a sustainable environment. The present study reported the conversion of mixed waste plastics into hydrocarbon fuels through catalytic pyrolysis using DOL, SiDOL, ZSM-5, and ZSMDOL catalysts. Doping of Si and ZSM-5 enhanced the surface area as well as improved catalytic activity. The NMR analysis confirmed that pyro-oil contains 8.31–12.61, 17.53–29.12, and 62.38–69.86 (v/v)% of aromatics, olefins, and paraffin's hydrocarbons, respectively. FTIR analysis identified the presence of alkane, alkene, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that pyro-oil contained a lower range (<C12) of hydrocarbon (up to ∼89%) when the catalyst was used. The fluidity properties such as density, viscosity, and pour point were reduced significantly in the catalytic pyro-oil due to the further cracking of intermediate hydrocarbons formed during the pyrolysis. The pour point was found to be the lowest (below -40 °C) for pyro-oil obtained with ZSM-5 catalyst. The highest calorific values of ∼50.9 MJ/kg and lowest carbon residues of ∼0.11 wt% were estimated for catalytic pyro-oils. The DI diesel engine performance showed that catalytic pyro-oils had better engine performance and combustion process compared to other fuels. Also, the emissions of harmful gases such as CO, HC, and NOx were found to be lower than commercial diesel when pyro-oil was blended with CD.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of mixed waste thermoplastic polymers using Si and ZSM-5 modified catalysts, with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and analytical characterization including NMR, FTIR, and mass spectrometry."
"Experimental study of catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene and polypropylene over USY zeolite and separation to gasoline and diesel-like fuels Thermal catalytic and non catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were carried out in a batch reactor at 450°C. The major product obtained from the non-catalytic pyrolysis of PE was 80wt% of wax, while the degradation of PP without any catalyst produced 85.5% of liquid. In catalytic degradation, ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite was used in a ratio of 1:10, with respect to PE and PP. In both cases, polymers were converted to liquid products with high yields (71 and 82wt% respectively) and a low amount of coke deposit has appeared. The liquid fraction derived from the catalytic pyrolysis of PE was a mixture of C5-C39 compounds and that of PP was a mixture of C5-C30. This wide range of components suggests the separation of liquids into two phases in order to use them as diesel-like and gasoline-like fuels. Three temperatures of separation (130, 150, 170°C) were tested and the physical properties were compared. Among the tested temperatures, 170°C was the optimal temperature of separation where the distillation curves and physical properties of the light and heavy phases fitted completely those of gasoline and diesel fuels, respectively. After separation, the gasoline-like fuel which represents 60.6% of the total oil of PP and 57% of that of PE had high octane numbers (RON=96 and RON=97, respectively), while the diesel-like fuel which accounts for 36.5% of the total oil of PP and 35.3% of that of PE have high calculated cetane numbers (52 and 53, respectively).","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics PE and PP with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent separation, and detailed fuel property analysis."
"The role of CaO and its influence on chlorine during the thermochemical conversion of shredder residue Different wastes are generated by the steel industry, among them the shredder residue (SR). The main source of chlorine in SR is the polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which makes the use of this residue in a thermochemical process a great challenge. In this context, the addition of CaO in the pyrolysis process can decrease the release of acid gases, especially HCl. The objective of this work was to evaluate the role of CaO and its influence on Chlorine during the thermochemical conversion of SR. A fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor was used and the following variables were evaluated using a 2k factorial design: temperature, heating rate, inert gas flow (N2) and CaO/SR ratio. The chlorine retention in char was higher in the experiments conducted in the presence of CaO. A decrease of the metals retention in char was verified in the experiments conducted with CaO for the following metals: Co, Cu, Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn. Through the removal of chlorine, it would be possible to conduct the pyrolysis process at higher temperatures, increasing its energy efficiency (EE). Therefore, the necessity to remove chlorine from SR before the pyrolysis process is evidenced, since from this the use of CaO would contribute to the EE increase and the metals retention in char, and consequently with the global desirability increase.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of shredder residue containing PVC, with measurable variables such as temperature, CaO/SR ratio, chlorine retention in char, and metal retention, including product yield and process efficiency analysis."
"Thermal cracking of potato-peel powder-polypropylene biocomposite and characterization of products—Pyrolysed oils and bio-char Waste plastic disposal is a major environmental issue worldwide. Pyrolysis is an effective tool to convert plastic to liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of biomass yields liquid oil with high oxygen content and thereby low heating value. However copyrolysis of plastic with biomass yield oil of low oxygen content, better stability due to synergy between them. In our research work we have carried out thermal cracking process in which the liquid oil has better stability and with very low oxygen content has been adopted for pyrolysis of potato-peel powder/polypropylene (POPP40) biocomposite and neat PP individually under identical conditions. The liquid products generated have been compared for physico-chemical properties. Analytical techniques like gel permeation chromatography, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy has been utilized for detailed characterization of pyrolysed oils and bio-char. A potential use of these pyrolysed oils has been explored where the 10% pyrolysed oil blends in diesel exhibited excellent fuel properties with improvement in cetane index, density and viscosity.","The study involves lab-scale thermal cracking of waste polypropylene (a plastic) and its biocomposite with potato-peel powder, with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and fuel performance data."
"Insight into the synergistic reaction mechanism of biomass pseudocomponents and polyamide by TG-MS and Py-GC/MS: Pyrolysis properties, reaction kinetics and N-containing species evolution To unveil the nitrogen migration and conversion characteristics, catalytic copyrolysis of biomass pseudo components and polyamide (PA) with different blend ratios (1:0, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 0:1) under an ammonia atmosphere was proposed to boost the yield of N-containing compounds (NCCs) and N-rich biochar. The evolution and distribution of NCCs in liquid, gas and biochar were systematically investigated with a combination of TG-MS, Py-GC/MS and EPR. Synergistic effects and possible reaction pathways were also evaluated. Experimental results showed that PA could obviously boost biomass conversion due to increasing the chance of secondary cleavage, and the comprehensive synergistic effect of biomass-derived H* radicals, acid sites of the catalyst and cracking reactions (-C-N and C-C bonds) that reduced the reaction energy barrier and enhanced the NH3 and HCN yields. NH3 comes from the amino acids that are released from the amino acid pyrolysis and hydrolysis of HCN on the surface of char, while HCN is from the secondary cracking of primary pyrolysis products. Adding biomass increased CO2, CO, CH4, C-O and CO emissions from co-pyrolysis. Additionally, significant synergetic effects were observed when Biomass/PA= 3:1, which improved the NCCs and pyridine yields by 78.58% and 48.23%, respectively, under the HZSM-5 catalyst. A lower proportion of PA addition facilitated the Maillard reaction and amide bond cleavage to enhance the NCCs content and suppressed π-conjugated ring structure compound evolution and coke-derived O-containing compound polymerization, while a higher content of PA was favorable for amine and diaza heterocycle compound formation. Moreover, the addition of PA reduced the HHV and N content in biochar, resulting in lower pyrrole-N content and graphitization degree due to secondary cross-polymerization reaction of reaction volatiles, but it enhanced the polarity due to higher oxygen content (14.98%).","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyamide (PA) and biomass pseudocomponents using TG-MS and Py-GC/MS, with measurable product yields, reaction kinetics, and N-containing species evolution analyzed under varying blend ratios and catalyst conditions."
"Pyrolysis of waste polypropylene plastics for energy recovery: Influence of heating rate and vacuum conditions on composition of fuel product This study compared the pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (PP) into fuel products under atmospheric and vacuum pressure conditions at different temperatures and heating rates. Four different temperatures (450, 488, 525 and 600 °C) at slow (15 °C/min) and fast (about 180 °C/min) heating rates were examined on a bench scale reactor. Pyrolysis vapours were recovered as heavy and light fractions by fractional condensation and characterised using GC/MS. Among all temperatures, 488 and 525 °C generated promising yields of condensable products under both atmospheric and vacuum conditions, with total yields in the range of 81–93 wt%. Heating rate effects on product composition distribution were more pronounced under vacuum pyrolysis. Gasoline range compounds predominated in light condensable products recovered under both atmospheric and vacuum pyrolysis. Vacuum suction limited the condensation of gasoline range compounds in the heavy fraction, resulting in Diesel/Gasoline ratio higher than 30. Higher Heating Values (HHVs) of all condensable products recovered under both atmospheric and vacuum conditions ranged between 41 and 46 MJ/kg, with higher values being obtained under milder conditions. Increased production of aromatics explained the lower HHVs obtained at higher temperatures.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polypropylene plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis using GC/MS."
"The pyrolysis of oak with polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene using fixed bed and stirred reactors and TGA instrument The pyrolysis of Iranian oak wood and waste plastics has been studied under different oak/plastic ratios and using different zeolite based catalysts. Pyrolysis of oak/plastics using a fixed bed reactor, resulted in the production of a liquid with a high oxygen content. The resulting organic liquids were re-pyrolyzed and deoxygenated using the zeolite catalysts in a batch stirred reactor under initial pressure of hydrogen and nitrogen (20 bars). The pressurized pyrolysis using HZSM-5 with a medium pore size of the 0.55 nm pore size gave the best de-oxygenation performance in comparison with the other catalysts. In TGA study, the slope of TGA curve and the onset temperature of degradation helped to assess degradation mechanisms and the related thermal stability. During thermal copyrolysis, the polymer melt penetrated and covered the oak particles and acted as an insulator. In addition to insulation, polypropylene and polystyrene partially and simultaneously degraded with cellulose, which led to increased cross interactions compared to polyethylene. Degradation of deposited melt polymer on the oak particles led to the formation of a thin layer coke covering the oak particles. The coke layer further increased the thermal stability of the remaining cross-linked lignin and resulted in a slower degradation.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS) in fixed-bed and stirred reactors with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Development of metal-doping mesoporous biochar catalyst for co-valorizing biomass and plastic waste into valuable hydrocarbons, syngas, and carbons The present study was aimed to explore a cost-effective route to produce metal-doping mesoporous graphite-like catalysts, which utilized metal chlorides (ZnCl2, FeCl3, and NiCl2) to modulate biochar within mesopore-creating, metal-doping, and graphitization simultaneously accomplished in the one-step thermal process. The properties of these as-synthesized catalysts were comprehensively characterized by a sequence of analytic methods (e.g., BET, NH3-TPD, SEM, EDS, TEM, FTIR, XRD, and Raman analysis). The carbon yields and HHV of bio-oils from ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste over the as-synthesized catalysts were around 50C% and 43 MJ/kg, respectively. Up to 96% of selectivity toward hydrocarbons when Ni/C was used as the catalyst, of which aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for nearly 40%. On the other hand, Fe/C was in favor of the production of H2 (90 NmL/gfeedstock) and syngas (~133 NmL/gfeedstock), which respectively occupying ~44 vol% and over 64 vol% in the gas; it also favored the generation of carbon nanotubes. Biochar produced from co-pyrolysis showed a high HHV at 28.33 MJ/kg, indicating the high potential as a solid fuel. In addition, the thermal decomposition behaviors and kinetics of biomass and plastic waste over the as-synthesized catalysts were also investigated by thermogravimetric analysis.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and biomass with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Pyrolysis gases produced from individual and mixed PE, PP, PS, PVC, and PET—Part I: Production and physical properties This article describes the production and properties of gases produced by the pyrolyses of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), and polystyrene (PS), and three of their mixtures at process temperatures of 500, 700, and 900 °C. The overall aim was to characterize all 24 gases in terms of their production and physical properties, and compare the data obtained to those of traditional fuels, namely natural gas (NG) and propane. In addition to experimental and analytical approaches for determining quantities and compositions of the pyrolysis products, various mathematical methods and their combinations were also used to determine product properties. The highest conversion of material into gas occurred during the pyrolysis of PP at 900 °C (66.88 wt% conversion into gaseous products). The pyrolyses of PE and PP at 500 °C were found to generate pyrolysis gases with the highest energy, with gross calorific values of 86.58 and 81.09 MJ m−3 N, respectively. The highest chemical energy yield was obtained by the pyrolysis of PP at 900 °C. Gases produced from PVC had a high thermal conductivity of about 104.83 mW m−1 K−1. The gas generated from PP at 500 °C exhibited a high specific heat of 2.94 kJ m−3 N K−1, and that obtained from PS at 500 °C had a very low kinematic viscosity (5.28 10−6 m2 s−1) and thermal diffusivity (7.90 10−6 m2 s−1). Even though numerous reports have dealt with pyrolysis gases, there is still not sufficient information about the specific physical properties of these gases. This article attempts to fill this gap and induce scientific interest in this field.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of commercial plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization of pyrolysis gases."
"Co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stems and waste plastics into biochar-based briquette: Product characteristics and reaction mechanisms Industrial hemp stems and polyvinyl chloride are heat-treated at 400–800 °C to prepare cylindrical biochar-based briquette. The results show that the co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stems and Polyvinyl chloride degrade at 205–519 °C with a mass loss of 84.173 wt%. According to the TG-FTIR, the co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stems and polyvinyl chloride produces large amounts of volatiles such as CH4, CO, CO2 and HCl. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature and holding time, industrial hemp stems can produce biochar-based briquette with a lower O/C-H/C ratio. Polyvinyl chloride can significantly improve the durability of biochar-based briquette. Besides, polyvinyl chloride can significantly increase the high heating value of biochar-based briquette due to the HCl gas increases the fixed carbon content of biochar-based briquette in the preparation process. When industrial hemp stems and polyvinyl chloride at the ratio of 1:1, the maximum high heating value of biochar-based briquette can reach 29.475 MJ/kg. The concentration of Cl in biochar briquettes is 9.260 mg/g, mainly in the form of metal chloride. Therefore, biochar-based briquette has a potential application prospect in bioenergy production due to the remarkable improvement of its properties.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyvinyl chloride and industrial hemp stems, with measured product yields, temperature-dependent mass loss, and analytical characterization of volatiles and biochar properties."
"Performance analysis and fate of bromine in a single screw reactor for pyrolysis of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) This study focuses on chemical recycling of plastics from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), which constitutes a problematic waste fraction due to the presence of brominated flame retardants. An auger reactor has been designed and used for this study. Real WEEE material provided by Stena Technoworld has been pyrolyzed under different temperature conditions. The performance of the reactor as well as other important parameters such as the fate of the bromine have been investigated and evaluated. The main outcome of this investigation is to simulate a continuous process, which can be useful for designing a full-scale industrial process. The mass balance results after performing thermal treatment at 400, 500, and 600 °C, showed a high gas yield (44 %wt) at the temperature of 600 °C, which energy content is enough to self-sustain the auger reactor. At the low temperature of 400 °C the oil production reaches its maximum yield as well as maximum concentration of bromine, corresponding to 0.5 wt% in the oil. Several valuable organic compounds have been detected in the oil composition, which can be used as precursors for feedstock recycling producing new plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) containing plastics, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent results, and analytical characterization of oil composition and bromine fate."
"Catalytic co-cracking of biomass and waste plastics with sawdust mediated ZSM-5 synthesized via activating gel process Minimizing the catalyst cost is critical to achieving long-term economic feasibility for obtaining bio-chemicals directly from biomass. In the present study, low cost ZSM-5 was synthesized via hydrothermal crystallization of the activated aluminosilicate gel without adding any organic ammonium templates and additional seed crystals. The activation process promoted the depolymerization of the silica-alumina species and the formation of active pasty gel containing nucleation precursors, consequently accelerating the subsequent crystallization reaction. The addition of eucalyptus sawdust (ES) in the synthesis process increased the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area and acidity of the resultant zeolites. The ES-mediated ZSM-5 (AGZ-10) achieved a higher benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) carbon yield (18.9 %) from co-cracking of ES and waste plastics (WP) (ES/WP mass ratio at 1:1) at 500 °C and exhibited better synergistic effect and anti-coking ability compared to the commercial ZSM-5. The results provide an efficient synthetic strategy to produce low-cost zeolites, and a promising technique to effectively utilize biomass and plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-cracking of waste plastics and biomass using a synthesized ZSM-5 catalyst, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Co-pyrolysis of coke bottle wastes with cellulose, lignin and sawdust: Impacts of the mixed feedstock on char properties Co-pyrolysis of coke bottle (CB) with sawdust/cellulose/lignin was conducted at 700 °C in this study, aiming to understand the potential influence of interactions of the volatiles of the varied origins on properties of the char. The results indicated that the interaction of volatiles from CB with that from biomass enhanced cross-polymerization of the volatiles, decreasing the formation of gases while enhanced the formation of both char and oil. The cross-interactions of the intermediates also diminished the formation of π-conjugated organics. In addition, the varied volatiles from the pyrolysis of cellulose, lignin, or sawdust interacted with that from CB and affected the properties of char in different ways. The char from the co-pyrolysis of sawdust/CB was more aliphatic, and had a higher oxygen content (7.3%) and higher polarity but lower thermal stability. Additionally, the thermal stability, crystallinity as well as the evolution of functionalities of char versus increasing temperature were also significantly affected by the cross-interactions of the volatiles.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (coke bottle) with biomass feedstocks, reports measurable product interactions and char properties, and includes experimental characterization of char at 700 °C."
"Three-stage thermochemical conversion of waste polyvinyl chloride This paper proposes a new-type three-stage thermochemical conversion process with an auger reactor (AR), fluidized bed gasifier (FBG), and tar-cracking reactor (TCR) to recover HCl and a clean and H2-rich syngas from waste PVC. In the AR heated to approximately 300 and 400 °C, pyrolysis produces HCl through dehydrochlorination. On the other hand, the FBG and TCR produce syngas from the pyrolysis residue. This study examined the effects of the reaction temperatures of the three reactors on the mass balance and HCl recovery. When the AR was unheated, the experiment was stopped due to hot filter clogging in the gasification part. When the AR was heated to 300 and 400 °C, approximately 70 wt% of the product was generated in the gasification part, and liquids collected in the AR part contained most of the chlorine present in waste PVC. The chlorine content in syngas and total tar yield decreased significantly when the AR was heated. The optimal FBG temperature appeared to be approximately 700 °C. The syngas and hydrogen yield and water conversion increased at a TCR temperature of 850 °C. The chlorine content in syngas was minimized to 10 ppm.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste PVC in an auger reactor at specified temperatures, with measurable product yields, chlorine recovery, and syngas production analyzed."
"Synergistic effect of Hami coal and polystyrene on products properties during co-pyrolysis: Evaluation on the contribution of different interaction sources Co-pyrolysis with low rank coal is an important way to treat waste plastics and recycle them into valuable materials. Complex interactions between volatiles-feedstock, volatiles-volatiles, and volatiles-char co-exist during co-pyrolysis, which will influence the synergistic effects and have not been extensively understood. In this work, some new feedstock configurations were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor to explore the contribution of these complicated interactions between different sources to the synergy effect observed during co-pyrolysis of Hami coal (HM) and polystyrene (PS). Results show that the interaction between PS-volatiles and HM-volatiles is found to be a dominant contributor to tar lightening in co-pyrolysis, which accounts for 5.67 wt% increase in the content of gasoline fractions (<180 °C) compared to the theoretical calculated value. Meanwhile, the content of gasoline fractions in tar increases with the enhancement of the interaction between volatiles and unreacted-HM. The volatiles and unreacted-HM interaction is the main contributions to synergy in aromatization of char, while the PS-volatiles and HM-char interaction plays an opposite role. The co-pyrolysis of HM-char locating on the top of PS also reveals the catalytic activity of HM-char on PS decomposition. Furthermore, the interaction between unreacted-HM and PS-melt is not conducive to the production of gas, but favorable to the production of char with high aromaticity. These results provide a valuable supplement for the understanding of the interaction mechanisms during co-pyrolysis, and also help to enhance synergistic pathways of the target products while simultaneously reducing inhibitory interactions.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) and Hami coal, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analysis of synergistic effects on tar, gas, and char composition."
"Controlling Diels-Alder reactions in catalytic pyrolysis of sawdust and polypropylene by coupling CO2 atmosphere and Fe-modified zeolite for enhanced light aromatics production Producing value-added light aromatics (BTEX) from solid waste streams holds excellent promise for resource recovery. Here we present a thermochemical conversion approach that enhanced BTEX production by coupling CO2 atmosphere and Fe-modified HZSM-5 zeolite to facilitate the Diels-Alder reactions in catalytic pyrolysis of sawdust and polypropylene. The Diels-Alder reactions between sawdust-derived furans and polypropylene-derived olefins could be controlled by tuning CO2 concentration and Fe loading amount. Sufficient CO2 (≥50%) with moderate Fe loading (10 wt%) were observed to produce more BTEX and fewer heavy fractions (C9 +aromatics). To deepen the mechanistic understanding, quantification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and catalyst coke was further conducted. The co-use of CO2 atmosphere and Fe modification suppressed the appearance of low-, medium-, and high-membered ring PAHs by over 40%, decreased pyrolysis oil toxicity from 42.1 to 12.8 μg/goil TEQ, and transformed coke from ""hard"" to ""soft"". Based on the characterization of CO2 adsorption behavior, it was deduced that the introduced CO2 was activated by loaded Fe and reacted in situ with H2 generated during aromatization to expedite H-transfer. Meanwhile, BTEX recondensation was prevented through the Boudouard reactions of CO2 and water-gas reactions between the resulting water and carbon deposits. These synergistically enhanced the production of BTEX and suppressed the formation of heavy species, including PAHs and catalyst coke.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of poplar tree and polystyrene with HZSM-5 and Fe/HZSM-5 for production of light aromatic hydrocarbons The catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste is a highly effective approach for the production of light aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted on poplar tree (PT) and polystyrene (PS) using pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The experiments were carried out at a temperature of 550 °C and a mixing ratio of 1:1. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were employed for the characterization of HZSM-5 and Fe/HZSM-5 catalysts. The findings indicated that the metallic Fe in the HZSM-5 catalyst led to an enhanced production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAH) during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of PT and PS. The proportion of MAH in the products obtained from HZSM-5 and Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was determined to be 85.84 % and 90.87 %, respectively. In the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, several crucial reactions took place, including deoxidation, olefins aromatization, and Diels-Alder reaction between furans and olefins. In the presence of Fe metal, the HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited enhanced selectivity towards valuable MAH while effectively suppressing the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, resulting in an increase in MAH production to 90.87 %.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) and biomass with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Investigation of the characteristics of microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics based on orthogonal experimental methods: Thermal degradation, kinetics and product distribution This research explores the synergistic effects and distribution of liquid products during microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis (MACP) of eucalyptus wood (EW) and polypropylene (PP). Firstly, thermal degradation and kinetics, of co-pyrolysis of EW and PP were investigated. The minimum average activation energy was observed at a mixing ratio of 50 % EW to 50 % PP, measuring 187.98 kJ/mol (KAS) and 189.82 kJ/mol (OFW), respectively. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, material ratio and microwave absorbent amount on the MACP of EW and PP were investigated based on the Orthogonal Design of Experiments (OED) method. The yield of three-phase product and chemical composition of liquid product were analyzed. The results indicated that the MACP of EW and PP significantly enhanced both the yield and quality of bio-oil. Optimal oil yield was achieved through MACP of EW and PP at 550℃ with a ratio of 30 % EW, 70 % PP, and 120 wt% microwave absorbent (SiC). The content of aromatic hydrocarbons peaked at the material ratio of 50 % EW and 50 % PP (E5P5) (42.53 %), while the content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) was 3.59 %. The peak content of MAHs occurred at 550 ℃, but further temperature increase resulted in the transformation of MAHs into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To optimize the content of MAHs in pyrolysis oil, the optimal MACP conditions are 550 ℃, E5P5 and 120 wt%SiC. The results of this research can act as a significant reference and offer practical insights for the effective generation of hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil via the MACP process involving biomass and waste plastics.","The study involves microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (PP) and biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Vacuum pyrolysis of commingled plastics containing PVC I. Kinetic study Thermal decomposition of commingled plastics comprising high and low density polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and poly(vinyl chloride) was investigated under vacuum conditions by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range of 25–600°C. The mixtures were representative of the major polymeric materials found in a municipal plastic waste (MPW) stream. The study focused on the role of each polymer in the stabilization or destabilization of other interacting plastics, as well as the fate of chlorine produced from PVC. First, the decomposition of each single plastic was investigated. Then the binary combination of all above polymers and finally the multicomponent mixture similar to a MPW sample were studied. Two approaches have been applied to study the interaction between components in the commingled plastics. The first approach involved a comparison of the experimental curve of the decomposition of the mixture with a calculated non-interacting component decomposition curve based on the behavior of the individual polymers. The second approach involved a comparison of the kinetic parameters of each plastic in the mixture as determined by two different methods: (1) fitting the single polymer decomposition curve and (2) fitting the peak corresponding to the pyrolysis of one particular polymer on the mixture pyrolysis curve. The results obtained indicate that some interactions occurred during MPW pyrolysis, mainly at high temperatures (>375°C). PS and PVC appear to be the plastics responsible for the interactions through their intermediate pyrolysis products. The chlorine from PVC in the mixture is released almost completely before 375°C, when the conversion of the MPW to pyrolysis products has reached ca. 13%.","The study investigates vacuum pyrolysis of commingled waste plastics (PE, PS, PP, PVC) under controlled temperature conditions with measurable decomposition behavior, product yield trends, and kinetic analysis of interactions, including chlorine release and thermal decomposition profiles."
"Stabilization of fresh and aged simulated pyrolysis oil through mild hydrotreatment using noble metal catalysts The nature and reactivity of the oxygenates, containing different functional chemical groups, and especially carbonyl compounds, render pyrolysis oil unstable. Alterations in physical and chemical properties of pyrolysis oil during storage and the catalytic stabilization of this oil is therefore critical and is the objective of the current work. In this study, Pd/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Rh/Al2O3, Re/Al2O3 and sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were employed in the hydrotreatment (180 °C, 60 bar H2, 4 h) of simulated pyrolysis oil to examine their effect on stabilization and potential polymerization routes. Of all the catalysts used, Pd/Al2O3 with well-dispersed metal particles, and a high char-suppressing potential was the most effective catalyst. It had the highest bio-liquid yield and the highest selectivity to low molecular weight stabilized oxygenates and deoxygenated products. In addition, the acidity in the light fraction was low and a very low solid product formation was found that consisted mainly of soluble polymers composed predominantly of aliphatic compounds and sugars, whereas insoluble polymers were not fully developed char. The solid yield increased in the following order: Pd (3.3 wt%) < Rh (13.3 wt%) < NiMo (13.6 wt%) < Pt (21.5 wt%) < Re (25.8 wt%) < Blank (27.4 wt%). This trend was also accompanied by an enhanced yield of heavy oligomers in the corresponding liquid phase abundant in phenolic compounds compared to carboxylic acids and aliphatic compounds based on GPC and P-NMR analyses. The Pd loading necessary to obtain a high-quality product was also assessed, and the lower carbon loss when using catalysts with smaller contents of metal was revealed. Based on the results a detailed reaction network was proposed regarding the reactions during stabilization of sugars, aldehydes, ketones, furans, acids and phenols present in pyrolysis oil. To delve deeper into the simulated pyrolysis oil properties, it was subjected to accelerated aging. Interestingly as much as 79 % of the feed was converted during aging. According to GC/MS analysis only large oligomers were formed that could not be detected. When removing the most reactive components from the feed, i.e. the sugar and furan, the conversion was lowered to 53 %. Catalytic stabilization was conducted on the aged oil and compared with stabilization followed by aging. The results showed that the solid formation increased from 5.1 to 9.1 % when the pyrolysis oil was first aged, followed by stabilization. A suggested reason for this is the large amount of oligomers that were formed during the aging. Thus, aging before stabilization is very negative for an industrial process.","The study involves pyrolysis of simulated plastic-derived oil, with experimental hydrotreatment using noble metal catalysts and measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and compositional analysis."
"Recycling poly-(methyl methacrylate) by pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed reactor The pyrolysis of poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) has been studied in a pyrolysis plant provided with a conical spouted bed reactor. This reactor is an interesting technology for the pyrolysis of waste plastics due to its excellent hydrodynamic behaviour and its high heat transfer and versatility. A previous kinetic study was carried out in thermobalance, in which the degradation of this polymer was observed to begin at low temperatures, 553K. Consequently, the activation energy is low compared to other plastics. The influence of temperature on pyrolysis product distribution in the conical spouted bed reactor has been studied in the 673–823K range. The products obtained at low temperatures are mainly the monomers of the polymer used for the study methyl methacrylate (MMA) and ethyl acrylate (EA). When the pyrolysis temperature is increased, the yield of monomers is lower due to the higher severity of secondary reactions, and there is a significant increase in the yield of gases. The maximum monomer recovery has been obtained at 673K, with the yields of MMA and EA being 86.5% and 6.2%, respectively.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic PMMA in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships.
"Analysis and techno-economic evaluation of co-pyrolysis of medical protective clothing and biomass With the increasing global energy demand and the worsening issue of energy shortages, the energy crisis has become a significant challenge worldwide. Meanwhile, the disposal of medical and agricultural waste is also becoming an increasingly critical issue. Medical waste, such as protective clothing, contains hazardous substances that, if improperly managed, pose threats to the environment and public health. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, not only consume high amounts of energy but also make it difficult to recover energy and materials from the waste. To address these problems, this study proposes a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution, aiming to convert hazardous medical waste into valuable fuel products such as CH4, H2, and CO through pyrolysis technology. In this regard, the study conducted a series of simulation experiments to analyze the pyrolysis of medical protective clothing (MPC), cow dung (CD), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and corn straw (CS) under different temperature and mixing conditions. The results show that the pyrolysis of MPC alone predominantly produces char (accounting for around 50%). Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC enhances the product yield. For example, at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC increases the methane (CH4) yield by 12% compared to the pyrolysis of MPC alone. Additionally, a life cycle assessment and a techno-economic evaluation were conducted from an application perspective. The results indicate that the project is economically feasible with net profits achievable in the second year of operation and has no harmful environmental impacts. Converting medical waste, agricultural waste, and other types of waste into biofuels holds the potential for being green, economical, and sustainable. This approach not only reduces reliance on traditional energy sources but also contributes to achieving carbon neutrality and promoting green development goals.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE) and medical protective clothing, with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships reported."
"Recycling of dual hazardous wastes in a catalytic fluidizing process A mixture of post-consumer polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrene (PE/PP/PS) with polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) waste was pyrolyzed over cracking catalysts using a fluidizing reaction system in an FCC process operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The influences of catalyst types and reaction conditions including reaction temperatures, ratios of catalyst to plastic feed, flow rates of fluidizing gas and catalyst particle sizes were examined. A model based on kinetic and mechanistic considerations associated with chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation in the acid-catalyzed degradation of plastics has been developed. The results of this study are useful for determining the effects of catalyst types and reaction conditions on both the product distribution and selectivity from commingled plastic waste, and especially for the utilization of post-use commercial FCC recycled catalysts for producing valuable hydrocarbons in a fluidizing cracking process. Moreover, the use of this recycled/modified FCC spent catalyst (RCat-s1) together with an optimal reaction system can be an adequate option since it may lead to a cheaper process with valuable products and can also be further used as a dual recycling of chlorine-containing hazardous waste plastics and a post-use commercial catalyst waste from FCC refinery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste (PE/PP/PS and PVC) using a fluidizing reactor with measurable reaction conditions, catalyst effects, and product distribution analysis."
"Coal gangue-supported catalyst for the efficient conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes From an economic and environmental perspective, pyrolysis-catalysis is a promising method for converting waste plastics into high-value products. Low-cost catalysts are crucial for the large-scale processing of waste plastics. This study prepared a nickel-based catalyst supported on solid waste coal gangue (CG) using a simple impregnation method and investigated the effect of catalyst composition on the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene to produce hydrogen and high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Experiments were conducted in a two-stage fixed bed reactor, where the plastic was pyrolyzed in the first stage (500 °C) and the resulting volatiles were activated on the catalyst in the second stage. The effects of catalytic temperature (700–900 °C) and Ni loading (5%–20%) on the products were studied. The results showed that the 15% Ni/CG catalyst exhibited optimal activity at a catalytic temperature of 750 °C, with maximum hydrogen concentration and yield reaching 66.48 vol% and 31.48 mmol/g, respectively, and CNTs yield reaching 79.71 mg g⁻1. At this temperature, the resulting carbon had a high degree of graphitization and fewer defects, with an ID/IG value of 0.72. Additionally, the gas-phase oxidation method effectively regenerates the coal gangue-based catalyst. After five cycles of pyrolysis-catalysis experiments, the hydrogen concentration and yield remained high, at approximately 63.0 vol% and 27 mmol g⁻1. Low-temperature oxidation removed most amorphous carbon, enriching the catalyst surface with up to 73.9 wt% CNTs of high quality (ID/IG ratio of 0.67). The mechanism of CNTs formation from polyethylene pyrolysis and catalytic decomposition was also discussed.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene waste plastic in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields of hydrogen, carbon nanotubes, and detailed product characterization."

"Study on the influence of different side chain structures on the pyrolysis behavior of polyolefin plastic wastes As an important component of organic solid wastes, disposal of plastic wastes (PWs) has always been a thorny issue. Thermochemical conversion is an efficient method. In-depth research on the influence of structural differences on their pyrolysis behavior is beneficial to promote the development of thermal treatment and conversion technology of PWs. The differences in the chemical structure of different polyolefin plastics at the molecule level are mainly reflected in their side chains. Herein, a series of typical polyolefin plastics with similar backbone structure and different side chain structures, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), were selected for comprehensive pyrolysis characterization in this work. Advanced experimental analysis methods such as in-situ DRIFT and 2D-PCIS were adopted to investigate the evolution of two weak oxygen-containing side chains during pyrolysis of PVA and EVA, respectively. Besides, typical product distribution of six samples were systematically studied by combining SVUV-PIMS and GC/MS. Spectral analysis showed that OH side chain in macromolecular structure of PVA had the weakest thermal stability, and its oxidation reaction occurred earlier than dissociation and dehydration, while the acetoxy side chain in EVA polymers could not only be directly dissociated via deacetoxylation, but also be transformed into OH side chain via deacetylation that occurred simultaneously with deacetoxylation. Further combined with SVUV-PIMS and GC/MS, the distribution characteristics of pyrolysis products of polyolefin plastics and the rules of generation and release of typical products with temperature were obtained in detail. It was found that the release of typical oxygen-containing products was earlier or slightly earlier than the release of hydrocarbons in pyrolysis of PVA or EVA. However, the release of all hydrocarbons was almost simultaneous during the respective pyrolysis process of HDPE, PP and PS, suggesting that the evolution of oxygen-containing side chains with weak thermal stability occurred earlier under the drive of temperature. Based on the characterization results, the main evolution pathways of different side chains were proposed to explain the influence mechanism of different side chain structures on the pyrolysis behavior of polyolefin plastics. The cleavage of CC bonds mainly occurred in HDPE, PP and PS, while the evolution of side chains occurred first in PVC, PVA and EVA, and exerted different influence on the degradation of carbon skeleton.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PS, PVC, PVA, EVA) using experimental methods including SVUV-PIMS and GC/MS to analyze product distribution and evolution pathways, with measurable yields and temperature-dependent product release data."
"Kinetic analysis of thermal and catalytic degradation of polymers found in waste electric and electronic equipment Thermo-chemical recycling of plastics originating in waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) is always a challenge due to the production of secondary value-added compounds or energy from obsolete materials. The dominant step for a suitable design of any pyrolysis reactor is to understand the kinetics of thermal degradation of the input materials. Therefore, in this investigation thermal and catalytic degradation of several polymers found in WEEE, such as High-Impact Polystyrene (HIPS), polypropylene (PP), and polycarbonate (PC) as well as PC/MgO and PP/MCM-41 was investigated. The random scission model developed by Sanchez-Jimenez et al., with L = 2 was used for the simulation of the degradation of all systems at several heating rates. The activation energy was estimated using an isoconversional approach. A system of differential equations were set and solved using as an adjustable parameter only the pre-exponential factor. It was found that using the same set of parameters, thermogravimetric data at different heating rates can be simulated very well in the range 0.3 < α < 0.9. This observation verified the hypothesis that at this region of degradation the dominant mechanism is that of random scission. Better simulation was obtained at higher heating rates. Using catalysts of variable acidity, it was verified that the activation energy of the catalytic was decreased compared to the conventional thermal degradation.","The study investigates thermal and catalytic degradation of waste electric and electronic equipment plastics (HIPS, PP, PC) using pyrolysis-related methods with measurable kinetic parameters, reactor conditions, and catalyst performance data."
"Elucidating synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis of plastics and paper in municipal solid waste: Thermal behavior and product characteristics Plastics and paper are common components of municipal solid waste (MSW), making an in-depth understanding of their interactions essential for MSW thermal conversion. In this study, the co-pyrolysis behavior of plastic and paper was investigated. Firstly, the thermal decomposition characteristics were analyzed. Secondly, the pyrolytic behavior was elucidated in a fixed-bed reactor. Thirdly, the impact of plastic melting on co-pyrolysis was clarified. Results indicated that the thermal decomposition was accelerated between 250 °C and 283 °C, while temperatures above 400 °C resulted in inhibition. During fixed-bed pyrolysis, char yields (70.7–16.9 %) were increased by 4.0 %–12.7 %. This increase was mainly due to plastic melting, which contributed 8.6 % and increased aliphatic carbon content. Besides, PVC and PET exhibited a broader melting range > 500 °C. Bio-oil yields (25.5–70.6 %) were reduced by 3.4 %–12.4 %, primarily affecting aliphatic compositions. Gas yields (3.8–6.5 %) were reduced < 400 °C but increased with temperature, involving primarily H2, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics and paper, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent behavior, and detailed product characterization."
"Different approaches to convert waste polyolefins into automotive fuels via hydrocracking with a NiW/HY catalyst Different approaches to upgrade waste plastic and vacuum gasoil (VGO) blends via hydrocracking have been investigated. The approaches have consisted on using different charges: (i) neat VGO; (ii) neat plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO); (iii) a PPO/VGO blend; (iv) a high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/VGO blend; and (v) a ternary PPO/HDPE/VGO blend. The runs have been conducted in a batch reactor at: 400–440 °C; 80 bar; catalyst to oil mass ratio, 0.1 gcat gcharge −1; and reaction time, 2 h. Obtained products have been grouped in different lumps, which are defined according to their boiling point range: gas, naphtha, light cycle oil (LCO), heavy cycle oil (HCO), wax (unconverted plastic) and coke. The concentration of the families of compounds (n-paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics with 1, 2 and 3+ rings) has been also determined. Results expose that composition of products is improved with respect to that obtained in the hydrocracking of VGO with both binary and ternary blends. The naphtha and LCO obtained in the hydrocracking of PPO/VGO and PPO/HDPE/VGO blends have a lower concentration of aromatics than the lumps of the VGO, making them more attractive to be added to the pools of fuels in refinery.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE) to produce pyrolysis oil (PPO), followed by hydrocracking experiments with measurable product yields and composition analysis."
"Fuel production from waste polystyrene via pyrolysis: Kinetics and products distribution In the present study polystyrene waste (PS) was collected from a drop off site in a local market and pyrolyzed at heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min and temperature range 40–600 °C under nitrogen condition. The apparent activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) were determined using 6 different kinetic methods. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor were found in the range of 82.3 – 202.8 kJmol−1 and 3.5 × 106–7.6 × 1014 min−1 respectively. The results demonstrated that the calculated values of Ea and A vary with fraction of conversion, heating rates and the applied model. Moreover, pyrolysis of waste polystyrene was carried out in an indigenously manufactured furnace at temperatures ranging from 340 to 420 °C. The composition of liquid and gaseous fractions was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Temperature and reaction time were optimized and the results revealed that temperature of 410 °C and exposure time of 70 min are the best conditions for maximum fuel oil production. Methane and ethane were found as the main products in the gas phase constituting about 82% of the gaseous fraction. The liquid products composed of broad range of C2 – C15 hydrocarbons depending on the pyrolytic parameters. A comparison of the composition of pyrolysis oil with standard parameters of diesel, gasoline and kerosene oil suggested that pyrolysis oil from polystyrene waste holds great promise for replacing fuel oil.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polystyrene, reports measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst-free reactor conditions, and detailed product composition analysis via GC–MS."
"Research on the characteristics of pressured pyrolysis products of marine plastics The problem of marine plastic pollution, mainly composed of polyolefin plastics, is becoming increasingly serious, and reducing marine plastic pollution is urgent. Pyrolysis, as a promising technology for treating polyolefin plastics such as polystyrene (PS), has great potential in addressing marine plastic pollution issues. In order to explore the possibility of resource utilization of marine plastics, this article studied the effect of pressure changes on the pyrolysis products of marine plastics. Marine PS was prepared by soaking routine PS in artificial seawater and air drying, and the most significant difference between the two was found to be the salt attached to the surface. The dynamic characteristics of marine PS were analyzed using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods, and the apparent activation energy of marine PS calculated by FWO and KAS methods are 102.94 kJ·mol−1 and 95.76 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The effect of pressure at different temperatures on the pyrolysis products of marine PS was studied. The results indicate that the yield of pyrolysis oil decreases as the pressure is increased, while solid products are obtained from scratch. The increase in pressure will gradually make the composition of the thermolytic gas become monotonous. Under critical pressure, pressurization promotes an increase in CH4 content while reducing H2 content, causing the lower heating value of pyrolysis gas to increase to 4.355 kJ·g−1. Analysis of oil content found that increasing pressure promotes the growth of Benzene Toluene Ethylbenzene & Xylene (BTEX) to 33.61%, but excessive pressure can significantly reduce the higher heating value from 42.116 MJ·kg−1 to 31.825 MJ·kg−1. The solid products were characterized using FTIR and it was found that pressure did not have a significant impact on surface functional groups. Increasing the pressure properly promotes the agglomeration of amorphous carbon.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of marine polyolefin plastics (PS) under varying pressures, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis, and characterization using FTIR and kinetic methods."
"Pyrolysis of polyolefins with steam to yield olefins The polyolefinic fraction of post consumer plastics waste was pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed lab scale reactor. In order to improve olefin yields, steam was used as the fluidizing agent. The influence of the reaction temperature on olefin yields was investigated in the range 600–800 °C. Furthermore, the residence time was varied at a given temperature of 700 °C between 1.8 and 3.2 s. The product distribution shows a characteristic influence of the cracking temperature on the yields of the different components. High amounts of olefins are obtained at temperatures around 700 °C, with 20–31 wt.% ethene, 14–18 wt.% propene, 3–6 wt.% butenes and, additionally, 19–23 wt.% pyrolysis gasoline as the main products. These yields are similar to the product distribution of naphtha cracked in a steam cracker, with 29 wt.% ethene, 16 wt.% propene, 10 wt.% butene/butadiene, and 24 wt.% pyrolysis gasoline. After separation the olefins can be reused as monomers for the production of polyolefins.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer polyolefinic plastic waste in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields and temperature-dependent analysis of olefin production.
"Assessment of thermochemical pathways for sustainable production of high-value chemicals from agroforestry wastes and plastics biorefineries This study aims to explore cost-effective upgrading strategies for biomass and waste plastics to achieve low-carbon sustainable development, serving as an alternative to traditional petroleum-based production routes for fuels and chemicals. An assessment of products recovered from major agroforestry wastes and disposable plastic packaging bags in the region is conducted through multiple thermochemical pathways. Specifically, the catalytic co-pyrolysis process enables synergistic and efficient conversion of biomass and plastics, yielding high-economic-value derivatives suitable for refining in existing petroleum infrastructure. The core of this work is the synthesis of inexpensive kieselguhr-based beta (KB) zeolites via an in situ depolymerization-recrystallization mechanism, where the dual active sites in metal-zeolite composites exhibit not only strong capture capacity for oxygenated compounds but also promote hydrogen transfer reactions for synergistic deoxidation-aromatization of products. During catalytic co-pyrolysis, KB zeolite effectively refines bio-oils, yielding carbon fractions ranging from C6 to C14, minimal oxygenated fractions, and a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) selectivity of up to 74.9 %. Even at a 2:1 biomass-to-plastic ratio, KB zeolite maintains long-term stable catalytic performance, with MAHs selectivity stabilized at 53.6 %.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis including MAHs selectivity and carbon fraction distribution."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene using microporous HZSM-5 and mesoporous Al-MCM-41 catalysts The catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with aluminosilicate catalysts is a promising method for the direct production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels consisting mainly of aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes). On the other hand, the economic and commercial viability of this process is limited by the low yields of aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, the effects of biomass torrefaction, co-feeding of plastic wastes, their combination, and the catalytic upgrading mode (in-situ vs ex-situ) on the aromatic formation efficiency during the catalytic pyrolysis of yellow poplar were evaluated systematically to maximize the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Two representative catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis (i.e., microporous HZSM-5 and mesoporous Al-MCM-41) were used in this case study. The torrefaction of yellow poplar led to the enhanced production of aromatic hydrocarbons in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene over both catalysts. The experimental yields of aromatic hydrocarbons from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene were also higher than their theoretical yields, highlighting the synergistic aromatic formation by the interaction of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene. Between the two catalysts, microporous HZSM-5 exhibited much higher activity for aromatic production from catalytic co-pyrolysis owing to its strong acidity and appropriate pore structure. Compared to ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis, the in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene produced larger amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons due to the more effective contact between the pyrolysis vapors and HZSM-5.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (a waste plastic) with torrefied yellow poplar, including measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of aromatic hydrocarbons."
"Pyrolysis of polyolefins for increasing the yield of monomers’ recovery Pyrolysis of plastic waste is an alternative way of plastic recovery and could be a potential solution for the increasing stream of solid waste. The objective of this work was to increase the yield the gaseous olefins (monomers) as feedstock for polymerization process and to test the applicability of a commercial Ziegler–Natta (Z–N): TiCl4/MgCl2 for cracking a mixture of polyolefins consisted of 46%wt. of low density polyethylene (LDPE), 30%wt. of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and 24%wt. of polypropylene (PP). Two sets of experiments have been carried out at 500 and 650°C via catalytic pyrolysis (1% of Z–N catalyst) and at 650 and 730°C via only-thermal pyrolysis. These experiments have been conducted in a lab-scale, fluidized quartz-bed reactor of a capacity of 1–3kg/h at Hamburg University. The results revealed a strong influence of temperature and presence of catalyst on the product distribution. The ratios of gas/liquid/solid mass fractions via thermal pyrolysis were: 36.9/48.4/15.7%wt. and 42.4/44.7/13.9%wt. at 650 and 730°C while via catalytic pyrolysis were: 6.5/89.0/4.5%wt. and 54.3/41.9/3.8%wt. at 500 and 650°C, respectively. At 650°C the monomer generation increased by 55% up to 23.6%wt. of total pyrolysis products distribution while the catalyst was added. Obtained yields of olefins were compared with the naphtha steam cracking process and other potentially attractive processes for feedstock generation. The concept of closed cycle material flow for polyolefins has been discussed, showing the potential benefits of feedstock recycling in a plastic waste management.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic and thermal pyrolysis of mixed polyolefin waste (LDPE, HDPE, PP) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance data."
"Waste plastic pyrolysis oils are promising feedstock for sustainable monomers production via steam cracking process Waste plastics pyrolysis oil (WPPO) is currently reprocessed to fuel components and ultimately combusted. Since some of these oils contain fragments of hydrocarbon chains, they are a promising candidate feedstock for a steam-cracking process for the production of sustainable monomers and chemicals. However, little is known about their cracking behavior. We performed micro-pyrolysis experiments with various WPPO samples and compared the yields of essential products to those of a traditional naphtha feedstock. We found that some WPPOs provided deeply reduced yields of the desired products, while others provided yields comparable or superior to typical naphtha (the highest yields were 32 % ethylene and 16 % propylene). Therefore, some WPPOs could replace a part of crude oil-based feedstock. We found that the product yields obtained from individual WPPOs differed substantially and were not easily predictable from basic feedstock characterization data. These findings reinforce the importance of the experimental research. The micro-pyrolysis technique showed a spectacular property as a selection method reflecting product yields.","The study involves lab-scale micro-pyrolysis experiments on waste plastic pyrolysis oils, with measurable product yields and comparative analysis to naphtha feedstock."
"Thermal and catalytic decomposition behavior of PVC mixed plastic waste with petroleum residue The pyrolysis and hydropyrolysis of PVC mixed plastic waste alone and with petroleum residue was carried out at 150 and 350°C under N2 gas and at 430°C under 6.5MPa H2 gas pressure. The behavior of plastic waste during thermal and catalytic decomposition has also been studied in single- and two-stage reaction processes. In the individual pyrolysis process, both the petroleum residue and polystyrene (PS) undergo more than 90% conversion to liquid and gaseous products, whereas low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) yielded lower conversions products, and polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) afforded somewhere a moderate to high conversion products. In a single-stage pyrolysis reaction, PVC was processed with petroleum residue at 150 and 430°C, under N2 gas for 1h at each temperature in a glass reactor. The model PVC and waste PVC showed slight variations in the products distribution obtained from the glass reactor. In two-stage process, model PVC, vacuum gas oil (VGO) and a number of different catalysts were used in a stainless steel autoclave micro tubular reactor at 350°C under the stream of N2 gas for 1h and at 430°C under 950psi (6.5MPa) H2 pressure for the duration of 2h. Significantly, different products distributions were obtained. Among the catalysts used, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydrocracking catalysts (HC-1) were most effective in producing liquid fuel (hexane soluble) materials. The study shows that the catalytic coprocessing of PVC with VGO is a feasible process by which PVC and VGO materials can be converted into transportation fuels.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVC, LDPE, HDPE, PP, PS) with petroleum residue using defined reactors and conditions, reporting measurable product yields and catalyst performance."
"The characterization of recycled PMMA The paper presents a study related to the possibility of obtaining polymers through the polymerization of liquid products, consisting mainly on methyl methacrylate (MMA), resulted from thermal degradation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), at 450°C in a laboratory scale installation. PMMA was obtained from MMA chemically recycled without any purification. The PMMA obtained from monomers resulted by thermal degradation of virgin PMMA is clear transparent; while PMMA polymerized from the liquid obtained by depolymerization of 20 years old PMMA (PMMA waste) is opaque due to the presence of impurities, which influence both the polymerization process and the properties of the obtained PMMA. The compressive and flexural strength and Vickers hardness have been determined and closed values have been found for polymers obtained from MMA resulted through depolymerization of virgin PMMA and that from PMMA waste.","The study involves lab-scale thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of waste PMMA to produce methyl methacrylate monomers, with measurable product yields and characterization of resulting polymers."
"Use of plastic waste as a fuel in the co-pyrolysis of biomass: Part II. Variance analysis of the co-pyrolysis process The aim of our study described in this article was statistical evaluation of the influence of process conditions on the chemical and physical properties of products obtained from biomass and plastic waste co-pyrolysis. To estimate the effects of the process conditions on the chemical and physical properties of products, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Furthermore, a mathematical equation that can be used to determine the degree of change in chemical and physical properties of the solid, liquid and gaseous products from co-pyrolysis depending on process conditions is presented in this article. In investigation were used alder wood (hardwood) and pine wood (softwood) with polypropylene addition which were carbonized in various thermal conditions. In the presented studied was described significant effect among char, liquid and gaseous fraction properties according to polymer addition. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) employed to exploratory analysis shows that the type of material has the most significant effect on the nitrogen concentration in the char, the nitrogen and sulphur concentration in the liquid fraction and the carbon mono- and dioxide, methane concentration in gaseous fraction.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of plastic waste (polypropylene) with biomass, includes measurable product yields and composition analysis, and reports experimental data on char, liquid, and gaseous fractions under varying thermal conditions."
"Enhancing bio-oil quality and hydrogen recovery through Co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch and polypropylene over a NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst The increasing accumulation of agricultural residues and plastic waste presents both environmental challenges and opportunities for energy recovery. Conventional disposal methods are inadequate, highlighting the need for efficient thermochemical valorization strategies. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) and oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) using a bimetallic NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the conversion efficiency and product quality of heterogeneous biomass–plastic blends. The originality of this research lies in harnessing synergistic feedstock interactions with a tailored bimetallic catalyst to improve liquid fuel and hydrogen-rich gas yields. Pyrolysis was carried out using a fixed-bed batch reactor at 400–600 °C with varying EFB:PP weight ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100). Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that PP promoted thermal degradation and reduced char formation. The NiFe/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a stable structure and homogeneous metal dispersion, which led to enhanced cracking, deoxygenation, and hydrocarbon formation. The optimal performance was observed at a 25:75 EFB:PP ratio, yielding the highest liquid fraction with an improved calorific value and lower density. Gas analysis revealed elevated hydrogen and light hydrocarbon contents at higher PP proportions, demonstrating the function of the catalyst in enhancing reforming reactions. These results demonstrate the critical influence of feedstock blending and catalyst design on optimizing co-pyrolysis for sustainable production of biofuels and hydrogen-rich syngas.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene and biomass using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature effects, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Ultrasonic pretreatment effects on the co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste and paper sludge through orthogonal test In this study, the influences of ultrasonic pretreatment factors (frequency, power, treatment time) on blends of municipal solid waste (MSW) and paper sludge (PS) with additive (MgO) was explored, through orthogonal experiments design. The optimum operating condition wanted to be acquired. However, for the ultimate (H/C) and ash analysis after pretreatment, solid residue mass and oxygenates compounds contents in products, the influences of factors were in different results. With adding PS unceasingly, the contents of hydrocarbon compounds decreased. And the ultrasonic pretreatment had the obvious influence with high PS percentage. Longer treatment time resulted to the lower content of oxygenates compounds. After adding MgO, the residue mass reduced, which meant MgO had the catalytic action, and the oxygenates compounds content reduced only with 100 kHz, which had the sonochemical effect.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (municipal solid waste) with paper sludge and catalyst (MgO), including measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE leads to valuable resource recovery and reduction of waste problems Recycling of waste polymers has become a necessity because huge piles of those polymers represent a threat to the environment. Used polymers are also a source of energy and valuable chemicals. Used low density polyethylenes (LDPE) were catalytically pyrolysed in a home assembled batch reactor under atmospheric pressure. For maximum conversion into chemicals which could be used for feedstock recovery optimum conditions like temperature, catalyst weight and reaction time were optimized. A wide range of acidic and basic catalysts like silica, calcium carbide, alumina, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide and homogeneous mixture of silica and alumina were tried for this purpose. Though CaC2 was better on the basis of reaction time, however the efficiency of conversion into liquid for SiO2 was found to be maximum at optimum conditions. These two catalysts could be picked up as suitable catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene. The results of the column separation using different solvents indicate that the oxide containing catalyst could be best suited for selective conversion into polar and aromatic products while CaC2 catalyst could be adopted for selective conversion into aliphatic products. The liquid product obtained from catalytic pyrolysis was also characterized by physical and chemical tests. Among the physical tests density, specific gravity, API gravity, viscosity, kinematic viscosity, aniline point, flash point, Watson characterization constant, freezing point, diesel index, refractive index, gross calorific value, Net calorific value and ASTM Distillation were determined according to IP and ASTM standard methods for fuel values. From the physical tests it was observed that the results for the liquid fractions are comparable with the standard results of physical tests for gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel oil. From the Bromine water and KMnO4 tests it was observed that liquid obtained is a mixture of olefin and aromatic hydrocarbons. This was further confirmed by Bromine number tests. The values of which lie in the range of 0.1–12.8g/ml, which fall in the range for olefin mixture. Phenol and carbonyl contents were quantified using UV/Visible spectroscopy and the values lie in the range of 1–8920μg/ml and 5–169μg/ml for both phenols and carbonyls respectively. The components of different hydrocarbons in the oil mixture were separated by using column chromatography and fractional distillation followed by characterization with FT-IR spectroscopy. The interpretation of FT-IR spectra shows that catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE leads to the formation of a complex mixture of alkanes, alkenes, carbonyl group containing compounds like aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds and substituted aromatic compounds like phenols. It could be concluded, that catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE leads to valuable resource recovery and reduction of waste problem.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste LDPE in a lab-scale batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of the resulting oil."
"Synthesis of N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes derived from plastic waste for adsorption of Pb2+ ions in aqueous solutions In this research multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) adsorbents were synthesized using polypropylene plastic as the carbon precursor, with melamine serving as the nitrogen source. A two-stage chemical vapour deposition (CCVD) method was employed for the pyrolysis of polypropylene, utilizing a nickel catalyst supported by CaCO3. Results showed that the nitrogen is successfully doped on N-MWCNTs as the surface is composed of nitrogen-containing groups, leading to the decrease in the carbon nanotube's outer diameter from 22.9 nm to 21.2 nm, an increase in crystallinity index from 81.40 to 83.19, an increase in specific surface area from 46.6 m2 g−1 to 76 m2 g−1, and an increase in pore volume from 0.09 cm3 g−1 to 0.18 cm3 g−1, enhancing their potential for adsorption applications. MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs were applied in the removal of Pb2+ ions from wastewater and the highest removal efficiency was 88.1 % in N-MWCNTs compared to 80 % in MWCNTS. The optimum conditions of pH 5, an initial concentration of 1 mg L−1, and an adsorbent dose of 0.005 g were used. Langmuir isotherm provided a better fit for the adsorption data with maximum monolayer coverage (qo) of 7.52 mg g−1 for MWCNTs and 8.91 mg g−1 for N-MWCNTs. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, indicating that chemical adsorption, involving electron exchange or sharing, is the dominant mechanism for MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic using a two-stage CCVD method with a nickel catalyst, resulting in measurable product yields and characterized MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs with specific surface area, pore volume, and adsorption performance data."
"Co-pyrolysis of petroleum based waste HDPE, poly-lactic-acid biopolymer and organic waste Waste pyrolysis is widely investigated, but less information is available about their co-pyrolysis. The present paper discloses the waste pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis in batch reactor at 400°C, 450°C and 500°C. The effect of the raw materials and temperature to the product was investigated. Product yield was increased and the quality (composition, contaminants, etc.) improved by co-pyrolysis. Gas and pyrolysis oil yields increased as function of temperature. Higher ratio of organic waste/petroleum based plastic waste resulted in lower yields of volatile hydrocarbons. Concentrations of oxygen containing products and contaminants are significantly changed with temperature or adding of HDPE into raw materials.","The study involves lab-scale batch reactor pyrolysis of waste HDPE (plastic) and PLA biopolymer with organic waste, reporting measurable product yields and compositional changes at varying temperatures."
"Effect of pyrolysis products from high impact polystyrene waste plastic on the performance of warm mix asphalt High impact polystyrene (PS) type plastics constitute an important part of electronic waste. Due to limited recycling, they are disposed of by incineration or landfilling, which leads to environmental problems. Therefore, increasing recycling is of great importance. This study explored the effect of the char (C) and liquid (L) components obtained by recycling PS waste plastic via pyrolysis method on the performance properties of warm mix asphalt (WMA). In the study, modified bitumen were prepared by blending base bitumen (50–70 penetration grade) with pyrolysis char and/or liquid at 0–3–6–10 % ratios (by weight of bitumen). The effects of pyrolysis products on WMA were investigated by binder tests including penetration, softening point, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Rotational Viscometer, Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR), and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) as well as mixture tests like Marshall Design, Hamburg Wheel Tracking (HWT), and Thermal Stress Restraint Specimen Test (TSRST). The binder test findings indicated a significant alteration in the characteristics of bitumen while utilizing 6 % of the char and liquid component additions. The incorporation of PS 6 %C-6 %L resulted in an increase in bitumen penetration, accompanied by a drop in softening point and viscosity. The reduction in viscosity culminated in a 15ºC decrease in the mixing-compaction temperature of the mixture. From the DSR and BBR analyses, the addition of PS 6 %C-6 %L decreased the performance grade (PG) high temperature of base bitumen by 1 grade, while the PG low improved by 1 grade. Marshall and HWT tests demonstrated that the stability and rutting resistance of WMA (PS 6 %C-6 %L) was equal to 89 % of that of hot mix asphalt (HMA). TSRST results also indicated that the low-temperature performance of WMA was 29 % and 8 % higher than HMA in terms of fracture temperature and thermal stress, respectively. To conclude, this study shows that pyrolysis products obtained from PS waste plastic have a high potential as a WMA additive.","The study involves pyrolysis of high impact polystyrene waste plastic, includes lab-scale experimental work with measured product yields and performance testing, and provides extractable experimental data on product effects and performance properties."
"RSM optimization of microwave pyrolysis parameters to produce OPS char with high yield and large BET surface area Microwave pyrolysis is a very effective technique to convert organic waste into energy rich products. In the present work micro porous and carbonaceous OPS char was synthesized by microwave pyrolysis technique. OPS char yield and its BET surface area was investigated as a function of process parameters to make the microwave pyrolysis of OPS more efficient. Both of these quantities were found to be affected by the process parameters. With the rise in microwave power (MWP) and radiation time (RT), OPS char yield was lowered while increase N2 flow rate (NFR) increased the OPS char yield slightly. Extreme values of either of the process parameter was seen to lower the BET surface area of OPS char. Response Surface Methodology (RSM), was used to optimize the process parameters for maximized OPS char yield and its BET surface area. Regression models for the OPS char yield and its BET surface area were also developed in this study. These regression models were having high Fischer test value & lower p-value which ensure its reliability and applicability. ANOVA analysis of the experimental data provided the process parameters to achieve maximized OPS char yield (60.93%) and BET surface area (250.03 m2/g). The predicted results were validated and it was found that the experimental data varied only by 5.99% in yield and 6.34% in BET surface area from the predicted values.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of organic waste (OPS) to produce char, with measurable yields, BET surface area, and optimization of process parameters, confirming lab-scale experimental work on a plastic-related feedstock."
"Novel conversion of polyethylene terephthalate into aromatic amines production through nitrogen-rich pyrolysis using Zn/CuCo₂O₄ spinel catalyst Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics under nitrogen-rich conditions to produce nitrogenous compounds represents a highly promising technological approach. It can achieve high-value conversion of waste plastics and expand the synthesis process of nitrogenous products. This work uses polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the raw material and urea as the nitrogen source to produce aromatic amines, and prepares Zn/CuCo2O4 spinel catalysts to enhance the above synthesis process. The results indicate that the optimal mass ratio of PET and urea is 1:1, where the relative content of nitrogenous compounds in the liquid product reaches 86.69 %, and the selectivity of aromatic amines reaches 52.48 %. The addition of the spinel catalyst significantly improves the selectivity of aromatic amines. Compared with the CuCo2O4 catalyst, ZnCo2O4 exhibits superior catalytic conversion performance. The optimal addition ratio of the ZnCo2O4 catalyst is 15 %, and the optimal pyrolysis temperature is 550 ℃. Under these conditions, the selectivity of aromatic amines increases by 11.11 % compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. In addition, the obtained solid residue containing the used catalyst is considered as a potential adsorbent and can be applied in water treatment. It has significant removal ability for methylene blue dye. This work not only provides a feasible approach for the production of aromatic amines, but also provides important support for the high-value utilization of waste plastics.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste PET plastic with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis-catalysis of different waste plastics over Fe/Al2O3 catalyst: High-value hydrogen, liquid fuels, carbon nanotubes and possible reaction mechanisms To understand the correlation between plastic structure and products, and the possible reaction mechanisms, the pyrolysis–catalysis of different types of waste plastics was investigated in the presence of an Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. Polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS) were used as the feedstock. The results showed that PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed higher H2-enriched gaseous product yields (>40 wt%), but higher H2 concentration (over 70 vol%) was obtained from the gaseous products of HIPS and GPPS. In terms of liquid oil, the yield exhibited a relatively stable tendency, which was ~ 20 wt%, and the liquid product comprised hydrocarbons with a carbon number range mainly between 8 and 16. For solid carbon deposits, HIPS waste plastic led to a higher solid deposit yield of 49.4 wt%, followed by GPPS of 48.7 wt%. By contrast, PP, HDPE, and LDPE showed lower yields of 30.2 wt%, 36.9 wt%, and 35.9 wt%, respectively. In summary, more, purer and cleaner carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be obtained from pyrolysis–catalysis of polyolefin (PP and PE), while more amorphous carbon and hydrogen were gathered from PS.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, HDPE, LDPE, HIPS, GPPS) with measurable yields of H2, liquid oil, and solid carbon deposits, along with catalyst performance and product composition analysis."
"Petrochemical feedstock by thermal cracking of plastic waste The thermal cracking is one of the possible ways to obtain petrochemical feedstock from polymer wastes. The properties of the cracking products depend mainly on the type of the raw material. In this study the degradation of different mixtures of polymer wastes (polypropylene and polystyrene) were investigated in a horizontal tube reactor. Temperature of 510–520°C and residence time of 15–30min were used. The effects of the concentration of polystyrene on the yields and structure of products were also studied. Moreover, the interaction between the polymers during the pyrolysis was investigated. The products of the thermal cracking were analyzed by gas-chromatography, infrared spectroscopy and different standardized and non-standardized methods. It was found, that the concentration of polystyrene significantly affected both the quantity and quality of degradation products. It was also observed that the presence of the polystyrene in the raw material increased the reaction rate coefficient, and enhanced the degradation rate of polypropylene. By higher concentration of polystyrene in raw materials, the yield of light products considerably increased, furthermore, in the naphtha-like fraction the concentration of aromatics also increased. The characteristics of the products were changed with the polystyrene content in the raw materials. The liquid products had advantageous properties for further utilization as fuel like or petrochemical feedstock applications.","The study involves lab-scale thermal cracking of waste plastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) in a horizontal tube reactor, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product analysis using GC and FTIR, demonstrating extractable experimental data."
"Olefins from polyolefins and mixed plastics by pyrolysis Mixed plastics collected from households were separated into a poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) poor light fraction (0.66 wt.% chlorine) and pyrolyzed in a fluidized bed reactor. The process was optimized to give high amounts of olefins. For comparison, high density polyethylene was used as feed material. The pyrolysis products contained about 36% ethene, 15% propene, 9% 1-butene and butadiene and an additional 15% pyrolysis gasoline. The olefins could be used again after separation as monomers for the production of polyolefins.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyolefins and mixed plastics in a fluidized bed reactor, with measurable yields of olefins and pyrolysis gasoline, including detailed product composition analysis."
"Transportation fuel production by combination of LDPE thermal cracking and catalytic hydroreforming Fuel production from plastics is a promising way to reduce landfilling rates while obtaining valuable products. The usage of Ni-supported hierarchical Beta zeolite (h-Beta) for the hydroreforming of the oils coming from LDPE thermal cracking has proved to produce high selectivities to gasoline and diesel fuels (>80%). In the present work, the effect of the Ni loading on Ni/h-Beta is investigated in the hydroreforming of the oils form LDPE thermal cracking. h-Beta samples were impregnated with Ni nitrate, calcined and reduced in H2 up to 550°C to achieve different Ni contents: 1.5%, 4%, 7% and 10%. Larger and more easily reducible metal particles were obtained on Ni 7%/h-Beta and Ni 10%/h-Beta. Hydroreforming tests were carried out in autoclave reactor at 310°C, under 20bar H2, for 45min. Ni content progressively increased the amount of gases at the expenses of diesel fractions, while gasoline remained approximately constant about 52–54%. Maximum selectivity to automotive fuels (∼81%) was obtained with Ni 7%/h-Beta. Ni loading also enhanced olefins saturation up to Ni 7%/h-Beta. High cetane indices (71–86) and octane numbers (89–91) were obtained over all the catalysts. Regarding the different studied Ni contents, Ni 7%/h-Beta constitutes a rather promising catalyst for obtaining high quality fuels from LDPE thermal cracking oils.","The study involves pyrolysis of LDPE waste plastic, with experimental reactor conditions, measured product yields, and analytical characterization of fuel quality."
"Carbon nanotubes synthetized from gaseous products of waste polymer pyrolysis and their application This work is dedicated to the synthesis of carbon nanotube from pyrolysis gases obtained by plastics. Virgin and waste plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinyl-chloride, municipal plastic waste) were used as raw materials and fed into a horizontal tubular reactor and pyrolyzed without catalyst at 560–570°C. Raw materials could be transformed into 14–32% gases and 15–44% pyrolysis oils, depending on the type of raw materials. Pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste produced the highest gas yield, while pyrolysis of virgin polypropylene gave the highest oil yield. Gases were passed through a chemical vapour deposition reactor, where they were transformed into carbon nanotubes at 700°C in a semi-continuous rotating reactor with 0.5h reaction time. To enhance the transformation of pyrolysis gases into carbon nanotubes (CNTs), Fe and Co based catalysts were used. Both gaseous and oil products of pyrolysis were investigated by gas-chromatography. The produced CNTs were added as reinforcement into a commercial low density polyethylene matrix using heated two roll mill and then specimens for testing were manufactured. Especially the reinforcing effects of carbon nanotube were investigated through the measuring of tensile and Charpy impact properties of the CNTs-LDPE polymers.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PA, and municipal plastic waste) with measurable yields, product characterization, and experimental conditions specified."
"Debrominated high quality oil production by the two-step catalytic pyrolysis of phenolic printed circuit boards (PPCB) using natural clays and HY The two-step catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of a phenolic-printed circuit board (PPCB) over in-situ natural clays (dolomite, bentonite, and olivine) and ex-situ HY(30, SiO2/Al2O3: 30) was investigated by tandem micro reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The non-catalytic pyrolysis (NCP) of PPCB produced oxygenated, phosphorous, and brominated compounds due to the presence of paper, tetrabromo bisphenol A (TBBA), phosphorous flame retardants, and phenol resin in the PPCB. Among the natural clays, dolomite showed the highest debromination and aromatics formation efficiency during the in-situ CP of PPCB followed by bentonite and olivine owing to the different catalyst properties. Two-step CP of PPCB over in-situ natural clays and ex-situ HY(30) achieved higher efficiency on the formation of higher quality oil (mono-phenol and aromatic hydrocarbons) with a lower Br content than the one-step CP of PPCB. Among the two-step catalysts, the combination of in-situ dolomite and ex-situ HY(30) provided the highest quality oil production due to the high acidity and sufficiently large pore size of dolomite. Two-step CP of PPCB over in-situ dolomite and ex-situ HY(30) also revealed a longer lifetime than the one-step CP of PPCB over ex-situ HY(30), not only for the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and mono-phenols, but also for debromination.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste phenolic printed circuit boards (PPCB), a type of plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis using GC–MS."
"Valorization of packaging plastic waste by slow pyrolysis Low and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) are three most common polyolefins profusely used as packaging materials and abundantly found in the plastic waste stream. These plastic waste samples were collected from household waste and converted into plastic derived oil (PDO) by low temperature (300°C to 400°C) slow pyrolysis (long isothermal holding time) in a semi-batch reactor. The PDO samples obtained had shown variation in their compositions and fuel properties based on the pyrolysis temperature. PDO from the pyrolysis of PP has high octane number (∼92) and low viscosity. Noticeably, the PDO samples obtained at low temperature pyrolysis are lighter with low viscosity, high octane number and having high calorific values. 1H NMR analysis revealed that the oil samples mostly consist of paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. Simulated distillation (SimDist) of PDO indicated that the liquid products resemble the characteristic closer to middle distillate of petroleum fraction having very low pour point and flash point. The temperature with long pyrolysis time also influenced the evolved gas composition and yield. Trace amount of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were present in the gaseous product along with various hydrocarbon gases ranging from C1–C5. The degradation mechanism follows end chain scission which produces monomer units whereas random scission results most of the hydrocarbon products. Subsequent reactions like radical recombination and inter or intra molecular hydrogen transfer results in the formation of most of the olefinic components.","The study involves lab-scale slow pyrolysis of waste packaging plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent fuel properties, and analytical characterization of oil composition and gas evolution."
"Study on the co-pyrolysis of high density polyethylene and potato blends using thermogravimetric analyzer and tubular furnace The interactions between high density polyethylene (HDPE) and potato during their primary and secondary co-pyrolysis process were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a tubular furnace. Kinetic analysis has shown that the devolatilization of potato was relatively faster compared to those of cellulosic materials, which has been ascribed to the multi-side-chain structure and lower polymerization degree of starch. The pyrolysis process of potato can be divided into three stages, and the main thermal degradation took place between 178 and 378°C, while the HDPE decomposition occurred in a single stage in the temperature range of 380–517°C. In the case of blends, the weight loss differences (ΔW) between experimental and theoretical ones were less than ±8% in all cases, and the co-pyrolysis process of potato and HDPE can be described as two consecutive first order reactions, the apparent activation energies of blends were almost invariable, suggested that only physical step limitation was found in the primary co-pyrolysis process of potato and HDPE. On the contrary, the results of tubular furnace experiment showed that due to the relatively long gas resident time, the interaction occurred in the gas phase not only favored the formation of gaseous products, but also improved the bio-oil quality by significantly reducing the oxygen-to-carbon ratios (O/C) of the pyrolysis oil.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastic HDPE and biomass potato using TGA and tubular furnace, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis oil quality."
"Recycling of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) with castor oil using microwave heating The chemical recycling of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using castor oil (CO) as a reagent is reported. CO presents a renewable alternative to petrochemical based reagents, e.g. glycols, and enables also substantial modification of final physico-chemical properties of a received product. Advantageously, microwave irradiation was used to accelerate the depolymerization of PET. A composition of obtained product was strongly influenced by the reaction temperature. When the decomposition of PET was performed at temperature higher than 240 °C, then a significant extent of side products based on PET oligomers and transesterified CO was observed due to dehydration and hydrolysis of CO. Contrary to that, PET decomposition took place at slow rate below 230 °C and the optimal reaction temperature lies in the relatively narrow interval from 230 °C to 240 °C. The product prepared in the optimal temperature range did not contain any high molecular weight PET oligomers. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry enabled to identify the structures included in the obtained polyol product. The maximum number of six repeating monomeric unit of PET was found in the product, which confirmed practically the complete depolymerization of PET chain and good reactivity of the acylester hydroxyl groups of CO.","The study involves microwave-assisted depolymerization of waste PET plastic, with measurable temperature-dependent product yields and analytical characterization of the resulting polyol product."
"Influence of ZSM-5 zeolite on the pyrolytic intermediates from the co-pyrolysis of pubescens and LDPE The catalytic reforming of the pyrolytic intermediates from the co-pyrolysis of pubescens and LDPE over the parent and desilicated zeolite ZSM-5 (DeZSM-5) was investigated. The results showed that the parent HZSM-5 exhibited high aromatization activity in the co-pyrolysis, whereas DeZSM-5 exhibited high alkanisation activity. On the other hand, the total relative content of phenolic compounds in aqua obtained by co-pyrolysis catalyzed by both parent HZSM-5 and DeZSM-5 was rather high (60–65%) compared to the thermal co-pyrolysis (26.94%). From the analysis of NH3–TPD for ZSM-5, it might be proposed that the aromatization was favored mainly by strong acid sites and the alkanisation was favored chiefly by weak acid sites in catalyst ZSM-5. In addition, the formation of phenolic compounds was mainly related to the interactions between the intermediates from the co-pyrolysis over ZSM-5.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) and biomass (pubescens) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis via GC–MS and NH3–TPD."
"Thermal-catalytic destruction of polyolephin polymers in presence of LnVO3 and LnVO4 This paper describes non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste materials. Four types of waste plastics were used in study: high density polyethylene (PE), low density polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Plastic waste was decomposed into three fractions under pyrolysis conditions: gas, liquid and solid residual. The use of vanadates MeVO4 and vanadites MeVO3 of REM (Me=La, Gd, Lu) as catalysts let to change the yield of the gas fraction and change the composition of the gaseous pyrolysis products. Catalytic decomposition increased the amount of the gaseous products by 15–20 %, reduced the condensate, and changed their composition with regard to the non-catalytic process at the same pyrolysis temperature. The total number of reaction products was determined in each fraction. The quantitative analysis of the composition of the gas fraction was performed by gas-liquid chromatography. The study of non-catalytic pyrolysis of plastics and thermogravimetric analysis let to determine the most favorable temperature conditions for the implementation of the catalytic pyrolysis. The catalytic pyrolysis of plastics was carried out in order to obtain the maximum yield of valuable gaseous products. The synthesized vanadites and vanadates of REM were used as catalysts. When using catalysts based on lanthanum and gadolinium compounds, a regular change in the amount of gaseous substances was observed without significant changes in their composition. The use of lutetium vanadate and lutetium vanadite demonstrated a phenomenal result that is associated with the cardinal change of structure of degradation products of PET. The syngas was obtained instead of acetaldehyde. This result is related to the structure of the used catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PET) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of gaseous products via gas-liquid chromatography."
"Pyrolysis of filled PMMA for monomer recovery The pyrolysis of low filled poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) waste is one of the few technical processes for feedstock recycling of plastics. Highly filled PMMA was pyrolyzed in an indirect heated fluidized bed for monomer recovery and compared with experiments using pure PMMA pellets as feed. The experiments were carried out in laboratory plants with throughputs of about 1 kg h−1 and in a mini pilot plant with a throughput of 30 kg h−1. At a temperature of 450°C acrylic glass yielded 98 wt.% of methylmethacrylate (MMA) while the amount decreased to 94% at 480°C. PMMA containing over 60% of quartz sand was pyrolyzed to 91% MMA. Other compounds are gas (2.0%), liquids (5.7%), and carbon black (1.2%).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PMMA, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields and analytical data on monomer recovery and byproducts."
"Pyrolysis of municipal plastic wastes II: Influence of raw material composition under catalytic conditions In this work, the results obtained in catalytic pyrolysis of three plastic waste streams which are the rejects of an industrial packing wastes sorting plant are presented. The samples have been pyrolysed in a 3.5dm3 reactor under semi-batch conditions at 440°C for 30min in nitrogen atmosphere. Commercial ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as catalyst in liquid phase contact. In every case, high HHV gases and liquids which can be useful as fuels or source of chemicals are obtained. A solid fraction composed of the inorganic material contained in the raw materials and some char formed in the pyrolysis process is also obtained. The zeolite has shown to be very effective to produce liquids with great aromatics content and C3–C4 fraction rich gases, even though the raw material was mainly composed of polyolefins. The characteristics of the pyrolysis products as well as the effect of the catalyst vary depending on the composition of the raw material. When paper rich samples are pyrolysed, ZSM-5 zeolite increases water production and reduces CO and CO2 generation. If stepwise pyrolysis is applied to such sample, the aqueous liquid phase can be separated from the organic liquid fraction in a first low temperature step.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic mixtures in a reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Kinetics of polystyrene pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed reactor A conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) has been used for the kinetic study of polystyrene pyrolysis in the 723–823K range and the results have been compared with those obtained by thermogravimetry (TGA) and in a microreactor (MR) of very high sample heating rate. The comparison proves the advantages of the gas–solid contact of this new reactor for the kinetic study of pyrolysis of plastics at high temperature, which stem from the high heat transfer rate between gas and solid and from the fact that particle agglomeration is avoided. It has been proven that, in the temperature range required for maximizing the yield of styrene, heat and mass transfer limitations within the particle are important when polystyrene particles of 1mm are fed into the reactor. A high yield of styrene is obtained (64.5wt.%) in the 723–773K range.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polystyrene, a commercial plastic, in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships."
"Thermal and thermo-catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene waste Thermal and thermo-catalytic cracking behaviour of a commercial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) waste was investigated in the temperature range of 400–450°C in a laboratory scale pyrex batch reactor. An equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FCC), HZSM-5 and a clinoptilolite containing rhyolite tuff were used as catalysts. The presence of a catalyst significantly altered both the yield and composition of the products and differences were found between catalysts having different acidities, micro- and macropore surface areas. The yield of gases increased in the order: non-thermo-catalytic cracking < clinoptilolite < FCC < HZSM-5 catalysed cracking, while the yields of liquid products increased in the sequence of non-thermo-catalytic cracking < clinoptilolite < HZSM-5 < FCC catalysed cracking. The catalysts significantly affected the isomerization of the olefin double bond and of the carbon-chain of the cracked products, the olefin content of liquids did not differ considerably. The effect of the catalysts on the yields and structure of products were getting less significant with increasing cracking temperature. The range of the carbon atom number in liquids was C5–C28 in non-thermo-catalytic cases, whereas using catalysts it was C5–C25, but the temperature of cracking had a noticeable effect on the distribution of carbon atom. Each liquid fraction is of low sulphur content, which may be advantageous for application as fuel.","The study investigates lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE waste using batch reactors and catalysts, reporting measurable yields, product composition, and temperature-dependent effects."
"A new sustainable strategy for oil, CH4 and aluminum recovery from metallised food packaging plastics waste using catalytic pyrolysis over ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst Paraffin wax and syngas are the major energy products synthesized by pyrolysis of metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW). These pyrolysis products contain a small amount of flammable compounds with negligible economic profit. Within this framework, this work aims to upgrade wax into oil and to increase the yield of flammable gases (e.g., CH4, C2H6, C3H8) in syngas generated during pyrolysis of MFPW using the catalytic pyrolysis process over ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst (10, 30, and 50 wt.%). The thermo-chemical experiments were performed in a semi-batch pyrolysis plant at 600°C. N2, O2, CO2, CO, CH4, and H2 gases generated during the entire process were observed with a digital gas analyser, while FTIR and GC measurements were employed to specify the chemical compounds of the obtained energy products (oil or wax and gases). Finally, aluminium (Al) fraction was separated from the obtained solid product of pyrolysis using leaching process. The results showed that addition of 10 and 30 wt.% of ZSM-5 to the reaction contributed to increase in wax yield from 12% to 19% without a significant effect on its structure. At 50 wt.% of ZSM-5, wax was converted into light hydrocarbon oil abundant in flammable compounds such as p-Xylene (18.2%), Benzene (14.6%), Toluene (7.3%), and o-Xylene (4.7%). Also, GC-MS results revealed that the gas obtained from 50 wt.% batch was rich in CH group (derived from CH4 compound) and Toluene (33%), p-Xylene (27%), Benzene (14.4%). Based on that the catalytic pyrolysis with 50 wt.% ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is considered to be a promising thermo-chemical technology that can be applied at industrial scale to convert MFPW into oil (21%), gas (66%), Al (8.8%), and Al-free char particles (3.12%).","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of metallised food packaging plastics waste, a type of waste plastic, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of oil, gas, and solid products."
"Catalytic cracking of polypropylene using aluminosilicate catalysts The microporous and mesoporous structured aluminosilicate materials MCM-22 and SBA-15, respectively, were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal treatment and then modified to H-Al derivatives. All prepared catalysts were investigated for their physicochemical features, including the surface area, pore volume and acidity, using powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, 27Al NMR spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and scanning electron microscopy. The derived catalysts were then utilized for the catalytic cracking of polypropylene (PP) in a batch reactor at atmospheric pressure, 350–400°C for 30min with a catalyst loading of 10wt% (of the PP mass) and a nitrogen flow of 20mLmin−1. Under these conditions, the PP conversion value was over 97% and 80% for the acid H-Al-SBA-15 and H-MCM-22 catalysts, respectively. For the mesoporous H-Al-SBA-15 catalyst, the major product was a liquid fraction (mostly low temperature distillate oil), such as C7–C8 hydrocarbons, with a boiling point similar to that of gasoline. With the microporous H-MCM-22 catalyst, the main products were gases that principally consisted of n-butane, C5 + hydrocarbons and propene.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions reported."
"Fast pyrolysis of a waste fraction of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) containing brominated flame retardants in a fluidized bed reactor: The effects of various Ca-based additives (CaO, Ca(OH)2 and oyster shells) on the removal of bromine A waste fraction of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) containing brominated flame retardants and antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) as a synergist was pyrolyzed in a bench-scale system equipped with a fluidized bed and char separation system. Experiments were carried out to observe the effects of the reaction temperature and three additives (CaO, Ca(OH)2, oyster shells) on the removal of bromine. An analysis of the pyrolysis oils obtained showed the oils were mainly composed of toluene, ethyl-benzene, styrene, cumene, α-methylstyrene, 1,3-diphenylpropane, 1,3-diphenylbutane and (1-bromoethyl)-benzene. When the Ca-based additives were used, the concentration of styrene was markedly increased; whereas, those of ethlybenzene and cumene were reduced. The total bromine content of pyrolysis oil produced without any additive at 459°C was about 5wt.%. When Ca(OH)2 and oyster shells were applied, the total bromine contents of the pyrolysis oils were decreased to 1.3 and 2.7wt.%, respectively. The antimony content in the pyrolysis oil was relatively small due to the efficient operation of the char separation system.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste high impact polystyrene (HIPS) in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, bromine removal efficiency, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Characterization of aromatic hydrocarbon formation from pyrolysis of polyethylene-polystyrene mixtures Design and operating parameters, and cause and effect relationships among feedstocks and products in the pyrolysis of waste polymers are needed if this method of processing is to be used for energy recovery from waste plastics. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of various operating factors for the pyrolysis of common polymeric wastes. Experiments were performed using a conventional retort tube as a batch reactor. The operating factors considered were temperature and reaction time at constant heating rate. High density polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS), the most common plastic waste in Korea, were used singly and in mixture. The pyrolysis time for maximum oil production from a PE-PS mixture was shorter than in the case of PE alone, showing an enhancement effect from the PS. The maximum gas production time from PE-PS mixtures was shorter than for PE alone at 500° C; above 600° C, this does not occur. Small aromatic compounds (which can be valuable) are produced at maximum with an 1:1 mixture of PE and PS at 600° C, showing the possibility of process control for the maximum recovery of desirable pyrolysis products. The maximum yield of toluene, xylene, styrene, and 1-propenyl benzene were 8.6, 8.9, 51.0 and 7.4 wt.% of feed for pyrolysis PS at 700° C, respectively. For naphthalene, it was at 700° C with 1:1 PE:PS (by wt.). The maximum recovery was 1.3 wt.%. Diels-Alder theory can explain the formation of aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis products. The yield of these secondary pyrolysis products can be controlled by reaction time, pyrolysis temperature and mixing ratio of plastic wastes in the pyrolysis feed.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE and PS) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of different torrefied Chinese herb residues and low-density polyethylene: Kinetic and products distribution In present work, the synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and torrefied Chinese herb residues (CHR) have been investigated by thermogravimetric analysis. The kinetic parameters of co-pyrolysis were calculated by Coats-Redfern method, and the difference values of experiment and theoretical were also investigated for gas and oil compounds. The results show that the extent of synergistic or inhibitory effects of co-pyrolysis was connection with the severity of CHR torrefaction, and the activation energy depend on the blend ratio of LDPE and CHRs. In addition, co-pyrolysis tends to generate more small molecule products and reduce oil yield, and increase the CO content but decreases CH4 in the gas product. The results also found that the liquid products have a significant interaction during the co-pyrolysis process, because the content of aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols in the blends pyrolysis oil has been greatly increased, and improving the quality of oil.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) mixed with torrefied biomass, with measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and analytical characterization of oil and gas products."
"Conversion of polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste and phenol steam reforming to hydrogen and valuable liquid fuel: Synthesis effect of Ni–Co/ZrO2 nanostructured catalysts Ni–Co/ZrO2 (NCZ) nano-structure catalysts prepared by the hydrothermal method (NCZ-hyd) and conventional impregnation (NCZ-imp) method. The comparative catalytic activity and coke resistance for each prepared catalyst were examined in steam reforming of phenol and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. The Physico-chemical catalysts properties were characterized by N2-adsorption, XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, EDX, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, and TGA. The effects of preparation methods of NCZ nano-structure catalyst on the catalytic performances in PET-phenol steam reforming were investigated. The NCZ-hyd nanostructure catalyst exposed more outstanding catalytic activity and more excellent coke resistance in comparison with the NCZ-imp. The experimental findings exhibited that catalyst synthesized by hydrothermal method were uniform with the size of 8.8 nm, while NCZ particles prepared by conventional impregnation method were un-uniform, unshaped, and agglomerated, and the size distribution of its particles was from 25 to 50 nm. PET-Phenol conversion and hydrogen yield of 56.5% and 52.5% for the NCZ-imp while 67.6% and 64.8% for the NCZ-hyd catalyst were achieved, respectively. The kinetic study of steam reforming of PET-phenol was also implemented. The activation energy was found to be 69.03 J/mol for NCZ-imp while 107.3 J/mol for the NCZ-hyd nanostructured catalysts. The PET-phenol steam reforming produced valuable liquid products such as benzene, 2-methyl phenol, and dibenzofuran which is one of the crucial keys to solving the waste plastic recycling problem.","The study involves pyrolysis of PET plastic waste in combination with phenol steam reforming, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis from lab-scale experiments."
"Effect of activated biochar as a low-cost catalyst on the quality of catalytic intermediate co-pyrolysis oil from waste polystyrene and green coconut pericarp Biochar-based catalysts and waste polystyrene were employed to study their effects on both the yield and composition of the oil produced on the intermediate pyrolysis of green coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) pericarp through catalytic co-pyrolysis. Biochar from intermediate pyrolysis was directly employed as a catalyst, but steam-activated biochars with different activation times from single step activation were also studied as low-cost catalysts. The properties of the catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, SEM, SEM-EDS, XRD, and ATR-FTIR techniques. From these techniques, AAEM (especially K) and O-containing functional groups were identified on both biochar and activated biochars, but the activated ones presented a higher surface area (>600 m2 g−1). Results from pyrolysis assays confirmed that co-processing biomass and waste plastic leads to a higher yield of oil while greatly shifting the product composition towards less oxygenated compounds. Catalytic co-pyrolysis with low-cost catalysts confirmed that it is possible to attain a high yield of monoaromatics without relying on zeolite catalysts. This effect was attributed to a synergetic effect between waste polystyrene and activated biochar, which ultimately resulted in an oil organic fraction containing up to 60% of xylene in its composition and presenting a HHV of 34.11 MJ kg−1.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste polystyrene and green coconut pericarp with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst characterization using experimental techniques."
"Fluidized bed pyrolysis of HDPE: A study of the influence of operating variables and the main fluidynamic parameters on the composition and production of gases In the present work, a preliminary study of the pyrolysis process of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fluidized bed is investigated in order to determine the influence between the fluidynamic properties of the bed reactor and the amount and composition of the gases produced. As is known, fluidized bed technology is a very interesting option to apply in the pyrolysis field due to i) the lack of moving parts in the hot region that facilitates the maintenance of equipment, ii) the high surface area to volume ratio available in the bed, and iii) the high heat transfer coefficient reached which governs the reaction products. But, heat and mass transfer coefficients are strongly affected by the fluidynamic properties of the bed. During the pyrolysis of HDPE, a fluidynamic characterization of the bed particles that consist of char-coated sand of HDPE has been carried out. Parameters such as the minimum fluidizing velocity (u mf), terminal velocity (u t), bed height (h f), bed voidage (ε f), fraction of the bed occupied by bubbles (δ), bubble diameter (d b), bubble velocity (u b), the mass transfer coefficients between the bubble and the cloud (K bc) and between the cloud and the emulsion (K ce) were determined. Subsequently, the influence of major operating variables and the fluidynamic parameters on the composition and the gas yield of the pyrolysis of HDPE were studied.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized bed pyrolysis of HDPE, reports measurable product yields and gas composition, and includes experimental characterization of fluidodynamic parameters and reactor conditions."
"Optimization of oil production through ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene with activated carbon This study studied the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (WPE) with activated carbon (AC). It was found that the operating parameters and AC/WPE mass ratio had complex interactions on the WPE-AC catalytic pyrolysis oil and gas yields. A hybrid method of artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA) was used to establish the mathematical expressions of oil and gas yields under different conditions and optimize the conditions to obtain the highest oil yield. The R2 values and the average absolute relative errors between the experimental and the ANN predicted values were 0.9992 and 0.60%, and 0.9830 and 5.01% in the training and the testing tests, respectively. The optimal oil production calculated by ANN-GA was 69.16 wt% under 479 °C, the AC/WPE mass ratio of 1, and 10 mL/min. The experimental oil yield was 69.63 wt% under the optimal parameters, which was close to the predicted value of ANN-GA. The WPE-AC catalytic pyrolysis oils under different conditions were characterized by the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The types of oil's functional groups did not change with different operating parameters and AC/WPE mass ratios. The oils were composed of alkenes, naphthenes, alkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons ranging from C8 to C33. The operating parameters and AC/WPE mass ratio affected the oil fractions to a great extent.","The study involves lab-scale ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of oil composition."
"Co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins with waste motor oil The co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins [waste polyethylene (PE) and waste polypropylene (PP)] with waste motor oil (WMO) was performed at different ratios under a nitrogen atmosphere at 500°C. The effects of WMO on the pyrolysis of waste polyolefins and their blends were investigated under identical conditions. The addition of WMO into waste polyolefins not only increased the liquid yields but also improved the properties of liquid products. In the most cases, the co-pyrolysis process had a positive synergistic effect on the liquid yields when compared with the calculated co-pyrolysis yields. The naphtha and paraffinic contents of the liquid products obtained from the co-pyrolysis of PE/WMO, PE/PP/WMO blends were higher than liquid products obtained from the pyrolysis of the individual waste polyolefins. The trace elements as well as heavy metals in the liquid products from the pyrolysis of WMO alone or the co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins with WMO were observed to be lower than the WMO feed. The prominent gas products obtained from the pyrolysis of individual waste polyolefins and WMO or the co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins/WMO blends were hydrocarbons and hydrogen. The heating values of the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis gases were found to be in the range of 27.6–32.4MJNm−3.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (PE and PP) with waste motor oil, reporting measurable product yields, synergistic effects, and detailed product composition analysis under defined conditions."
"Deconvoluting the roles of polyolefin branching and unsaturation on depolymerization reactions over acid catalysts Developing a circular economy for plastics is a societal priority with a range of stakeholders engaged in developing pathways to mechanical and chemical recycling. Acid catalysis has been proposed as an attractive strategy to chemically recycle or upcycle plastic waste. In principle, the energetics that govern polyolefin decomposition reactions over Brønsted acid sites should be the same ones known for alkane cracking. However, the nature of polymers as feedstock imposes new challenges for these well-known processes, e.g., strong mass transfer limitations. To better understand the role of polymer structure and diffusion on cracking rates, the effect of tertiary carbons, chain unsaturation, and catalyst active sites distribution were studied. Our findings confirm that higher concentrations of tertiary carbons will govern decomposition reactions, regardless of diffusion limitations. Also, we unveil that LLDPE reactions mostly take place on the external surface of ZSM-5 crystals while HDPE conversion takes place within the zeolite pores.",The study investigates polyolefin depolymerization over acid catalysts using lab-scale experiments with measurable outcomes on reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance.
"A critical review of the correlative effect of process parameters on pyrolysis of plastic wastes Plastics contribute significantly to the plight of an ideal solid waste management system, and the dilemma of its safe disposal upon harnessing its untapped potential still looms large. An appropriate answer to such a predicament is an energy conversion technology that deems both economically and environmentally profitable. Pyrolysis of plastic wastes has been attempted for commercialisation unsuccessfully throughout the last decade, owing to the substandard economisation of the process and non-compliance of its products to emission standards. Though the pyrolysis technology and the parameters involved have been extensively studied, a gap exists in the practical implementation due to its complex mechanism involving many variables that play a significant role in products' yield, distribution and the system's overall performance. The present work strives to statistically analyse the effect of feedstock and other operational parameters on pyrolysis oil yield and quantify their impacts utilising Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The intensity and significance of the impact of the operational parameters are studied, and a ranking system is attempted to help in the technology's successful priority-optimisation technique and implementation. The results suggested that the reaction temperature is the most critical parameter, with positive PCCs of 0.857 and 0.855 for pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis, respectively. The percentages of Carbon and Hydrogen (H %), residence time, heating rate (HR) and amount of catalyst exhibited positive correlations with oil yield. Among the negatively correlated parameters, the moisture content in feedstock presented a high PCC of − 0.830, followed by particle size. This work presents a collective statistical quantification that aids us in the priority-based optimisation of the pyrolysis process.","The abstract describes lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic waste with measurable parameters such as temperature, residence time, heating rate, catalyst amount, and moisture content, and reports quantitative correlations with oil yield, including specific Pearson Correlation Coefficients."
"Investigation into the shape selectivity of zeolites for conversion of polyolefin plastic pyrolysis oil model compound The relationship between the structure of zeolites and their performance in 1-octene conversion, a model compound in polyolefin plastic pyrolysis oil, has been elucidated. Zeolite topology determines reaction pathways being possible to direct the reaction to the formation of light olefins or aromatics. Small pore zeolites (≤ 6.1 Å), facilitate octene-cracking reactions. For example, MOR produces 98% of small olefins (54% C5). Large pore size zeolites catalyze aromatizations to BTX, also producing paraffins and hydrogen. Zeolites with pore sizes around 6.1 Å produce BTX with reduced coke formation. Thus, MFI produces 32% of C2-C5 olefins, 27% paraffins, and 23% of BTX. The olefins, paraffins, and BTX are found in an alkylation/dealkylation equilibrium conditioned by the catalyst’s pore size: the larger the pore size, the longer and more branched the products are. In addition, 1-octene isomers are dominant products at low contact times (∼0.045 s) and BTX at long contact times (∼4.5 s).",The study involves pyrolysis of polyolefin plastic pyrolysis oil model compound (1-octene) using zeolite catalysts under controlled reactor conditions with measurable product yields and composition analysis.
"Converting polystyrene waste into valuable oils: high performance of SUZ-4 zeolite for selective oil component conversion in catalytic pyrolysis The increasing concern over plastic waste disposal has led researchers to explore sustainable methods for converting waste into valuable products. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste (PSW) using SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. SUZ-4 is synthesized from agricultural waste (rice husk), making it a more sustainable option. Results indicate that catalytic pyrolysis with SUZ-4 at a PSW-to-catalyst ratio of 1:0.033 at 350 °C produces an oil yield of 81.60 ± 1.62 %, containing 49.34 % styrene and 21.22 % α-methylstyrene. Under the same conditions, ZSM-5 yields 77.73 ± 1.24 % oil, with 33.18 % styrene and 18.58 % α-methylstyrene. In comparison, non-catalytic pyrolysis at 400 °C results in a 74.23 ± 1.25 % oil yield. These findings demonstrate that the type of catalyst significantly influences product distribution. Both SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolites have 10-membered ring pore systems, but their structural and acidic properties lead to different catalytic behaviors. SUZ-4’s weaker Brønsted acid sites limit excessive secondary cracking, enabling selective cracking. In contrast, ZSM-5 zeolite has stronger Brønsted acid sites and an open, interconnected pore network, which promotes deeper cracking and aromatization, resulting in many types of aromatic compounds in the oil products. Catalytic pyrolysis also reduces the viscosity of the oil compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Differences in chemical composition also affect fuel properties such as heating value, pH, and color. Overall, catalytic pyrolysis offers advantages in terms of higher oil yield and lower operating temperatures. However, differences in catalyst type significantly impact oil composition, which in turn affects fuel quality.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste (a commercial plastic) in a lab-scale reactor with measurable product yields, temperature conditions, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Effective deoxygenation for the production of liquid biofuels via microwave assisted co-pyrolysis of agro residues and waste plastics combined with catalytic upgradation Rice straw and sugarcane bagasse were co-pyrolyzed with polypropylene and polystyrene using microwaves, and the pyrolysis vapors were catalytically upgraded using HZSM-5 catalyst. The product yields, composition and properties of bio-oil from pyrolysis of individual feedstocks and equal composition mixtures before and after catalytic upgradation were thoroughly investigated. The pyrolysis oil yields from polypropylene (82 wt%) and polystyrene (98 wt%) were high compared to that from rice straw (26 wt%) and bagasse (29 wt%). Catalytic upgradation at weight hourly space velocity of 11 h−1 resulted in higher selectivity to unsaturated aliphatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Properties of upgraded bio-oil from biomass-polypropylene mixtures were similar to that of light fuel oil with high calorific value (43 MJ/kg), low viscosity (1 cP), optimum density (0.850 g/cm3) and flash point (70 °C). Oxygen content in catalytically upgraded co-pyrolysis bio-oil was low (<5%) as compared to upgraded pyrolysis bio-oil (14–18%), and pyrolysis bio-oil without upgradation (20–24%).","The study involves microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) with biomass, including measured product yields, catalytic upgradation, and detailed characterization of bio-oil properties."
"Catalytic and thermal pyrolysis of polycarbonate in a fixed-bed reactor: The effect of catalysts on products yields and composition A meaningful and advanced method concerning the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) becomes a necessity, mainly due to their increased production, applications and their short life. Thermal methods have been an attractive option and for this reason the investigation of pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis as a potential method for the recycling of polycarbonate (PC) based plastics has been the aim of the current study. Nine different catalysts with variations in properties (such as porosity and acidity/basicity) were introduced in a bench scale pyrolysis system together with the polycarbonate polymeric material and the pyrolysis fractions were collected and analyzed. The liquid product consisted mainly of phenols and substituted phenols as well as the original monomer and, due to the commercial value of these products in the chemical industry, it is expected to enhance the economic viability of the process. Results showed a reduction in the degradation temperature in the presence of all catalytic materials, depending on the pore characteristics and the acidic nature of the solid. It seems that in the presence of the basic catalysts, PC degradation leads to lower molecular weight compounds and high phenolic fractions in the liquid produced. In terms of reduction in the production of the monomer, pore size rather than acidity appears to be the determining factor.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic and thermal pyrolysis of polycarbonate, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic upgrading of a model polyethylene pyrolysis oil by hydroconversion over Ni-containing hierarchical Beta zeolites with tailored acidity Valorization of waste polyolefins by a sequential combination of thermal pyrolysis and catalytic hydroconversion over a bifunctional metal/acid catalyst (e.g. zeolite) is an efficient route to produce transportation fuels. However, the zeolite strong acidity typically causes extensive cracking and loss of liquid fuels. In this work, mild dealumination with oxalic acid of a hierarchical Beta zeolite was used to achieve Ni 7%/h-Beta catalysts with Si/Al ratios within the 25 – 130 range. These catalysts were tested in the hydroconversion of a model mixture of LDPE thermal pyrolysis product (1-dodecene/n-dodecane, 50/50 w/w). The highest share of liquid fuels (∼ 90%) was achieved over 7% Ni/h-Beta (SiAl = 130). Besides, due to its high accessibility and tailored acidity, the product contained a meaningful amount of isoparaffins (12%) and a negligible content of olefins (< 3.5%). Thus, this catalyst holds promise for plastic waste hydroconversion towards transportation fuels.",The study involves pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (LDPE) and includes lab-scale catalytic hydroconversion with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data.
"Pyrolysis of municipal waste: Effect of waste type and co-pyrolysis on the formation of products and coke over zeolite catalyst Thermal pyrolysis of different types of wastes including LDPE, carton, tire and poplar wood was conducted to investigate the effect of feedstock on the properties of products. The co-pyrolysis of single feedstocks was also the next trial. Zeolite (A4) was the catalyst. The reason for this was to study the influence of the catalyst on the products and also the effect of feedstock type on the structure of coke. The results showed that the type of feedstock could change the quantity and quality of the products significantly. Considering the average of the properties of the products obtained from the single feedstocks pyrolysis, the specification of the products obtained from the pyrolysis of mixture feedstock showed nonlinear changes. This indicated the cross-interaction of volatiles and non-volatiles through the secondary reactions during the co-pyrolysis process. Depending on the feedstock type, zeolite (A4) had different effects on the pyrolysis process. Zeolite (A4) increased the rate of cracking of large species and also their polymerization, but differently for different feedstocks. The nonlinearity of the change of the properties during the catalytic co-pyrolysis was observed. No coke/little amount formed on the surface of the catalyst after the pyrolysis of all types of the feedstocks used. However, the slight deactivation of the catalyst due to the change of the catalyst structure was seen.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE) and other municipal wastes, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and coke formation."
"Enhanced pyrolysis of oil sludge and polymer waste in sub and supercritical water: Production of low-carbon syngas, and liquid hydrocarbons using bimetallic catalyst based on nickel-cobalt Accumulation of waste of plastic materials, formation of the oil sludge and hydrocarbons spills from household users and petroleum industries processes in nature, constitute a major danger for the environment whence, research of new effective techniques to expand the possibilities of the wastes recycling, is crucial. However, this paper focuses on the synthesis of bimetallic catalyst (BMC) based on Ni-Co supported on Al2O3 for the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and oil sludge (OS) samples in sub and supercritical water (sub- and SCW) for fuels and low carbon syngas production. Experiments were performed in a batch reactor at the temperatures and pressure ranges 350 – 410°C and 213.7 – 268.9 bars for 1 h. Characterization of the BMC and pyrolysis products was done by XRD, XRF, SEM-EDX, TGA, FTIR, GC-MS, GC and EPR methods, respectively. The findings reveal that the yield of the total gases, including unsaturated gases, increase with the pyrolysis temperature, and are composed by C1–C4, C2=C4, H2, CO and CO2. At a temperature of 380°C it is found that, the pyrolysis of the low density PE and that of PET-II, in the absence of BMC significantly generated the C2=C4, CO and CO2 up to 6.2, 33.14 and 48.34 mol.%, through a secondary cracking and decarboxylation of PET, respectively. It is found that, the composition of the resulting liquid product from pyrolysis of PET, is mostly composed of Benzoic acids, Biphenyl and that, the Benzoic acid catalyzes the reaction of CO2 formation itself, in the absence of BMC. Thus, use of BMC reduced the rate of CO and CO2 by 2.80 and 3.5 times while that of C1, H2 and ΣC2-C4 increased to maximal of 45 mol.%, 24.63 mol.% and 44.59 mol.%, respectively. Moreover, a high conversion rate of 58.46 wt% was achieved from the PE-I, and that of liquid hydrocarbons of 47.24 wt% observed for PE-IV, at 380°C in the presence of BMC. The results revealed that most of H2 source is essentially based on the water gas shift reaction and Sabatier's. Around 43–50 wt% of water was involved in the pyrolysis of PE, and that 0.4 % of Dodecadien-1-ol and 5 % of Decanedioic acid were detected only in the liquid product using the BMC. Overall, the use of BMC for pyrolysis of samples in SCW water is beneficial for the production of H2 and C1 with the reduction of CO and CO2 emissions.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PET) and oil sludge in sub- and supercritical water with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Pyrolysis products from various types of plastics using TG-FTIR at different reaction temperatures Pyrolysis products of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and municipal plastic waste at different reaction temperatures were predicted in the current study using a newly developed thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) method. The experiments revealed that pyrolysis products of LDPE and PP at 500 °C were almost wax. Above 600 °C, wax formed from LDPE and PP almost disappeared, while the production of light hydrocarbons was enhanced. In the cases of LDPE and PP, the benzene and toluene formations were clearly observed above 800 and 700 °C, respectively. For PS, styrene was observed as the major component at 500–800 °C. With increasing temperature, the formations of alkenes, benzene, and toluene were enhanced at the expense of styrene. Different from other plastics, PET produced a pyrolysis vapor containing mainly CO2 and CO. FT-IR spectra of PET were almost unchanged despite increasing temperature above 600 °C. In the case of municipal plastic waste, the product distribution was similar to those of LDPE and PP. The new TG-FTIR method turned out to be an effective tool to predict pyrolysis products, especially gases products having low molecular weights.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, PP, PS, PET, and municipal plastic waste) with measurable product yields and composition analysis at varying temperatures using TG-FTIR, including observed changes in wax, light hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, and styrene formation."
"Resource recovery from synthetic polymers via microwave pyrolysis using different susceptors In this study, microwave assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was conducted, and the effects of microwave power, susceptor type, and PP to susceptor ratio on (i) temperature and heating rate profiles, (ii) overall oil, gas and char yields, (iii) composition of oil and gas, and (iv) heating value of oil, were evaluated. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a multimode microwave reactor equipped with accurate temperature monitoring system. The individual constituents in oil and gaseous fractions were analyzed using gas chromatograph equipped with mass spectrometer and flame ionization detectors. Six different microwave susceptors such as graphite, aluminum, silicon carbide, activated carbon, lignin and fly ash were utilized. At optimal conditions of 450W microwave power and 100:1wt./wt. of PP (5g):graphite, nearly 48wt.% of oil with heating value of 44.45MJkg−1 was obtained along with 50wt.% of C3–C6 gaseous hydrocarbons. The scalability of the process was evaluated by pyrolyzing 50g of PP under the above conditions, which resulted in 83% energy recovery in the oil. While alkenes and cycloalkanes constituted a major fraction in the oil, their relative yields varied significantly with different susceptors suggesting that the susceptors also acted as catalysts and interacted with the polymer besides transferring the incident microwave energy. The applicability of the technique was also demonstrated for pyrolysis of commercial polyethylenes and polyisoprene.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PE, polyisoprene) with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions, including experimental data on oil, gas, and char yields, heating values, and catalyst-like susceptor effects."
"Investigation of gasoline-like transportation fuel obtained by plastic waste pyrolysis and distillation Gasoline-like hydrocarbon products obtained from the distillation of different pyrolysis oils produced from solid wastes of polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), and their blends were investigated as these materials together form a good candidate for providing gasoline with properties approaching or fulfilling standard requirements in various countries. A laboratory-scale batch reactor equipped with reflux was used in this research, while the gasoline fractions of pyrolysis oils processed by distillation were further analyzed by GC-MS. Fuel density, volatility, distillation curves, olefin content, aromatics (including benzene) content, and oxygenates were analyzed, and various scenarios were proposed for reaching standard quality. The results were compared to a commercial gasoline sample from Hungary. It was found that the gasoline-like product of low-density PE (LDPE) and high-density PE (HDPE) showed the most similarities to standard requirements regarding molecular distribution. The PS produced mainly aromatics, while the gasoline yield of PP contained 53.5 vol% 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, which severely affects the distillation requirements presented by gasoline fuel standards. The results show that the mass ratio of plastic materials used in the pyrolysis process can heavily influence the oil products’ applicability as a transportation fuel. The optimal plastic waste mixture combined with the saturation of the olefin content by catalytic hydrogenation can provide standard-quality gasoline.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PS, PE) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization (GC-MS), and fuel property analysis, meeting all required criteria."
"Comparison of catalytic performance of an iron-alumina pillared montmorillonite and HZSM-5 zeolite on a spouted bed reactor Catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) on HZSM-5 catalyst and an iron-alumina pillared montmorillonite, prepared in laboratory (FAMO), was performed by means of a conical spouted bed reactor. This type of reactor is a suitable technology for plastic pyrolysis due to its high heat and mass transfer rates and excellent performance in the handling of sticky solid materials. The pyrolytic process carried out on HZSM-5 catalyst gave significant yield of gaseous products (above 74 wt%), while FAMO catalyst gave high yields of waxes, particularly rich in diesel hydrocarbon range (C11–C21). Waxes obtained by subjecting HDPE to thermal pyrolysis had a higher range of molecular weight. Waxes have been characterised using different techniques, such as gel permeation chromatography (GPC), polidispersity (PD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Simulated Distillation, and TDP.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE plastic using a spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance comparison, and detailed analytical characterization of waxes."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene over Ga loaded HZSM-5 The effect of catalyst structure, acidity, and Ga addition of zeolites on the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was investigated by comparing PP cracking efficiency and product distribution properties in this study. Thermogravimetric analysis result indicated that HY(SiO2/Al2O3; 30) is the most effective catalyst lowering PP decomposition temperature, followed by Ga/HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(80), and HZSM-5(280). Meanwhile, Ga/HZSM-5(30) revealed the lowest apparent activation energy (Ea), 110 kJ/mol, than HY(30) (159 kJ/mol), and other HZSM-5 catalysts (122 ~ 172 kJ/mol), suggesting its high efficiency lowering Ea on PP pyrolysis. Py-GC/MS results also suggested that Ga/HZSM-5 produces the largest amount of aromatic hydrocarbons, followed by HZSM-5(30), HZSM-5(80), HY(30), and HZSM-5(280). The increase of Ga/HZSM-5(30) amount on PP pyrolysis led the further decrease of Ea value and increase of aromatics production efficiency.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and reaction kinetics."
"Recycling of plastic waste using flash pyrolysis – Effect of mixture composition Recovery of plastic waste is becoming crucial since the amount of such waste increases continuously. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the pyrolysis technique for the recovery of plastic waste. In that frame, the influence of temperature (550°C or 600°C) on the pyrolysis of pure polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was first studied. It is shown that whatever the type of polymer, aromatic compounds are mainly formed and could reach 55wt.-% of the oil fraction for PP and 31wt.-% for PE at 550°C. In a second step, a PP/PE mixture and a model mixture representative of the packaging plastic waste stream were pyrolyzed to investigate the influence of a combination of polymers on the proportions and composition of the different fractions. The pyrolysis of the polymer mixtures shows that, even if the aromatic compounds formed are similar to those obtained for the virgin polymers, the proportion of aromatic compounds is much more important than when the polymers are pyrolyzed alone. Indeed, mixing PE with PP at a 50/50 ratio does not affect the amount of liquid, gas and solid fractions but leads to the formation of a higher quantity of xylene (39 wt-%) at 550°C. The combination of the plastics in the model mixture has also led to a decrease of the amount of waxy compounds. Furthermore, it was shown that a higher amount of aromatics than expected was formed. As a conclusion, this study demonstrates that pyrolysis is an effective technique to recover plastic waste as aromatic compounds for the petroleum industry. In the specific conditions used in this study (proposed model mixture and pyrolysis conditions), it will favor the idea that sorting is not needed to recover plastic waste through pyrolysis since aromatics formation is favored when the stream is composed of a mixture of polymers.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PE, PS, PET) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis via GC–MS."
"Microwave-initiated MAX Ti3AlC2-catalyzed upcycling of polyolefin plastic wastes: Selective conversion to hydrogen and carbon nanofibers for sodium-ion battery Waste polyolefins, accounting for over half of all plastic wastes, represent a largely untapped resource. Efficiently upcycling polyolefin wastes into value-added resources by catalysis is both economically and environmentally sustainable but rather challenging due to lacking of highly selective catalysts and viable utilization of upcycled products. Herein, MAX (Ti3AlC2) is employed as both microwave-susceptor and catalyst to promote deconstruction of polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) into highly pure hydrogen and graphitic nanofibers for Na ion battery. The hydrogen production selectivity of 75 vol % (LDPE), 78 vol% (HDPE) and 78 vol% (PP) are all the highest among reported methods. More importantly, carbon-nanofibers are obtained with high graphitization degree, empowering their application in Na-ion battery as anode electrode materials with good rate capability and stable cycling performance (2000 cycles). Our results demonstrate MAX Ti3AlC2 as a promising microwave-susceptible catalyst and find new applications in energy storage for plastic waste-upcycled resources.","The study involves microwave-initiated catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin plastic wastes (LDPE, HDPE, PP) with measurable yields of hydrogen and carbon nanofibers, including experimental characterization and performance data for battery applications."
"Chemical upcycling of high-density polyethylene into upcycled waxes as rheology modifiers and paper coating materials Chemical upcycling of plastic waste from landfills to value-added products offers both economic and environmental benefits. Reported here is a simple method to convert high-density polyethylene (HDPE) into upcycled waxes in a very high yield (up to 93%). This selectivity is achieved by reducing the degradation temperature of HDPE via the addition of an inexpensive and reusable sodium chloride. These upcycled waxes had performance comparable to those of commercial rheology modifiers. In addition, kraft paper coated with these upcycled waxes exhibited excellent water- and oil resistance. A preliminary revenue analysis showed that this innovation allows plastic-to-wax to conversion with a three-fold revenue benefit over traditional ways of producing pyrolysis waxes from plastics. Also, sodium chloride reduces the pyrolysis temperature, thus reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting cleaner production, a circular economy, and generating less environmental pollution. The underlying concept reported herein can be extended to major plastics by reducing the degradation temperatures of plastics, thereby obtaining even better control over the pyrolysis products. Thus, these findings have the potential to enhance the circular economy of plastics and protect our environment from plastic waste.","The abstract describes lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE waste with measurable yields (up to 93%), catalyst use (sodium chloride), and product characterization as upcycled waxes with performance comparable to commercial products."
"Co-pyrolysis behaviour and synergistic effect of municipal solid waste components on biochar production through microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis This study systematically evaluated the interactive effects of variation of institutional solid waste (ISW) components as foodwaste (FW) (65–80 %): plastic waste (PLW) (5–12 %): paper waste (PW) (10–20 %): yard waste (YW) (1.3–3 %) on microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) of ISW, on biochar yield and higher heating value (HHV) using central composite design. The waste composition of FW (76.6 %): PLW (5.3 %): PW (15.8 %): YW (2.3 %) yielded the highest biochar output (37.9 %) and FW (71.3 %): PLW (11.8 %): PW (14.8 %): YW (2.1 %) yielded greater HHV (26.5 MJ/kg). Biochar yield reduction by cir.32 % and HHV improvement by cir.19 % were observed with PLW increase from 5–12 % in ISW. The ISW composition of FW (72.6 %): PLW (10.1 %): PW (14.8 %): YW (2.5 %) was determined to be optimized condition with biochar yield of 30.9 % and HHV of 25.3 MJ/kg. Such ISW biochar (ISWB) has better characteristics than individual waste biochar. The O/C ratio of ISWB (0.15) was lesser than the corresponding individual waste biochar implying its enhanced thermal stability. ISWB demonstrated a uniform pore size distribution ranging from 1.5–4.0 µm.

"Pyrolysis of waste expanded polystyrene and reduction of styrene via in-situ multiphase pyrolysis of product oil for the production of fuel range hydrocarbons Upgraded fuel oil was produced from the waste expanded polystyrene (WEPS) using pyrolysis and in-situ selective aromatization in a specially designed reactor. The catalytic pyrolysis of WEPS was performed keeping the catalyst in three different types of catalyst arrangements inside the reactor i.e., A-type/catalyst in liquid phase, B-type/catalyst in vapour phase, and AB-type or Multiphase/catalyst in both liquid and vapour phases, respectively. The ZSM-5 ammonium powder was used as a catalyst with varying feed to catalyst ratio and 20:1 was found to be optimum. Aromatics of fuel range like benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene (BTE) were significantly increased and styrene got reduced by many folds when AB-type/multiphase catalytic pyrolysis was performed. The thermal pyrolysis produced maximum liquid yield of 94.37 wt% at a temperature of 650 °C and a heating rate of 15 °C/min. The maximum liquid yield of 88.05 wt%, 78.85 wt%, and 75.11 wt% were obtained for the A-type, B-type, and AB-type catalytic pyrolysis at the temperature of 600 °C, 550 °C and 550 °C, respectively using the same heating rate. The liquid oil of thermal pyrolysis contains very low amount of fuel range aromatics i.e., BTE of 11.38 wt% and the highest amount of styrene (84.74 wt%). In contrarily, BTE content for the catalytic process increased progressively in the order of 18.98 wt% (A-type) < 24.27 wt% (B-type) < 28.12 wt% (AB-type). The styrene content significantly decreased to a very low value of 46.30 wt% for AB-type/multiphase pyrolysis at the temperature of 550 °C.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste expanded polystyrene (a commercial plastic) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Tandem catalytic cracking of LDPE to C2-C4 olefins over interconnected NZ@Al-meso-SiO2: Role of hierarchical porosity and acidity Catalytic upcycling offers a promising route to valorize end-of-life polyolefins as high-value chemicals, yet significant challenges remain. Adjusting the hierarchical porosity and acidity of composites can effectively enhance polyolefins cracking efficiency. Thus, systematically studying their effects on cracking performance is essential. In the presented work, the interconnected NZ@Al-meso-SiO2 composites are synthesized for the efficient tandem catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into light olefins (C2-C4). By adjusting the ZSM-5/meso-SiO2 mass ratio and the Si/Al atomic ratio, the impact of hierarchical porosity and acidity on product distribution was systematically investigated. The results indicated that medium ZSM-5/meso-SiO2 mass ratio (n = 0.3) facilitates the tandem cracking of LDPE and enhances mass transfer. The Al-meso-SiO2 component selectively pre-cracks LDPE into intermediates and subsequently timely diffusion and deep cracking of the intermediates in nanosized ZSM-5, ultimately converting into C2-C4 olefins. The low Si/Al ratio (50) demonstrates a high acid density and the Brønsted/Lewis (B/L) acid ratio, exhibits greater selectivity for light olefins compared to a higher Si/Al ratio. The optimized NZ@Al-meso-SiO2-0.3–50 delivers an impressive performance, achieving ∼50 wt% light olefin yields at 550 °C within just 15 min. This exceptional activity and selectivity significantly surpass conventional single-component catalysts, physical mixtures, as well as exceeding results reported in the literature. This rational design of synergistic tandem catalysts provides a powerful foundation for developing advanced composite materials for diverse catalytic upcycling and reaction processes.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of reaction conditions and product distribution."
"Preparation of carbon nanotubes by catalytic pyrolysis of dechlorinated PVC Plastic waste is attracting growing interest for its utilization potential as a valuable resource. However, conventional thermochemical methods can hardly achieve high-value utilization of certain plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) characterized with high chlorine content. Here, a low-temperature aerobic pretreatment method was introduced to realize high-efficiency dechlorination of PVC, and then the dechlorinated PVC was used to prepare carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a catalytic pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that oxygen can significantly promote the HCl release in a pretty low-temperature range (260–340 °C). Chlorine was almost completely eliminated at 280 °C under 20 % oxygen concentration. Compared to untreated PVC, using the dechlorinated PVC as raw material, higher carbon deposition was obtained and over 60 % CNTs could be collected from the carbon deposition. This study provides a high-value utilization way for the production of CNTs from waste PVC.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of dechlorinated PVC plastic waste, with measurable product yields (over 60% CNTs) and experimental conditions (temperature, oxygen concentration) clearly reported."
"Thermal degradation of typical plastics under high heating rate conditions by TG-FTIR: Pyrolysis behaviors and kinetic analysis Pyrolysis of plastics has gained more attention recently due to the advantages of environmental protection and energy conversion. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied under high heating rate conditions to investigate pyrolysis behaviors and find the most suitable kinetic reaction mechanisms. The TG and DTG curves for LDPE were similar to those for PP, but different from those for PVC. It was found that high heating rate led to the shifting of initial, end and peak temperatures to higher values. The FTIR results showed the main products of LDPE and PP were alkanes and alkenes, and the major products of PVC were HCl, alkenes and a small number of aromatic compounds. A comparative study of model-free methods like Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Friedman method were discussed to calculate activation energy. Kinetic reaction mechanisms were predicted by using model-fitting methods including Coats-Redfern and Criado method. The pyrolysis reaction mechanism of LDPE was summarized as contracting sphere model, PP was summarized as contracting cylinder model, whereas that of PVC was concluded that two-dimension nucleation for the first stage and three-dimension diffusion (Jander) for the second stage.","The study involves lab-scale thermal degradation of waste plastics (LDPE, PP, PVC) with measurable product analysis via FTIR, kinetic analysis of pyrolysis behaviors, and experimental characterization using TG-FTIR, satisfying all mandatory criteria."
"Catalytic reactions of post-consumer polymer waste over fluidised cracking catalysts for producing hydrocarbons A post-consumer polymer mixture (PE/PP/PS/PVC) was pyrolysed over catalysts using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The effects of reaction conditions including catalyst, temperature, ratios of commingled polymer to catalyst feed and flow rates of fluidising gas were examined. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolitic catalysts (HZSM-5>HUSY≈HMOR) gave higher yield than non-zeolitic catalysts (SAHA≈MCM-41). Product distributions with HZSM-5 contained more olefinic materials with about 60wt.% in the range of C3–C5. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffinic streams with large amounts of butane (C4). The larger pore zeolites (HUSY and HMOR) showed deactivation in contrast to the more restrictive HZSM-5. MCM-41 and SAHA showed the lowest conversion and generated an olefin-rich product with a rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reactor conditions. Valuable hydrocarbons of olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times used in this study.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste (PE/PP/PS/PVC) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene with lead sulfide into fuel oil The influence of lead sulfide as a catalyst on the pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene has been investigated. The yield and composition of the derived gas, oil and wax have been studied in terms of the temperature, time and amount of catalyst. The oil consisted of mainly paraffins and olefins. More than 70% yield of gas and liquid fraction with boiling point up to 350°C was obtained. The composition of the oil fraction was characterized by physicochemical properties of petroleum fuel. Distillation data showed that ∼10% have the boiling range of light naphtha (<160°C), ∼30% of heavy naphtha (160–208°C) and ∼55% of middle distillate (208–350°C). Lead sulfide was found to be an effective catalyst for conversion of polyethylene into fuel oil.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene, a waste plastic, with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions reported."
"Study on pyrolysis behavior of polymeric coated aluminium scrap using TGA and Py-GC/MS Polymeric-coated aluminium scrap obtained from a local recycling plant in Thailand was used as raw material. The thermal decomposition behavior and evolved gas from the pyrolysis of the polymeric fraction coated on the aluminium surface were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS). Initially, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to study the thermal decomposition of all the coated aluminium scraps (white, black, and brown color). From the TGA results, a major thermal degradation at 300–480 °C associated with the decomposition of the polymeric fraction was found in all the powder-coated samples. The weight loss was 4.57 wt %, 3.56 wt %, and 1.64 wt % in the white-, black-, and brown-coated scraps, respectively. Then, the pyrolysis of the polymeric layer coated on the surface was investigated using a Py-GC/MS. The effect of pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C) and the type of coated aluminium scrap on product selectivity was studied. In terms of pyrolysis, the polymeric materials used in the coating would decompose via scission reaction generating volatile compounds. At a temperature of 600 °C, the carboxylic end groups (40.46–45.62 %) and aliphatic HCs (19.69–25.34 %) were the major pyrolytic products with a small number of aromatic HCs (2.76–7.76 %). In addition, low fractions of N-containing compounds (3.05–8.08 %) produced from the decomposition of cross-link agents were found. The maximum temperature (600°C) promoted high selectivity of hydrocarbons (aromatic and aliphatic) from β-H scission, cracking, and deoxygenation reactions. Aliphatic hydrocarbons consisted of alkenes, alkynes, and cycloalkenes with carbon in the range of C5–C24, while aromatic hydrocarbons with carbon in the range of C6–C20 were composed of mainly toluene, biphenyl, styrene, etc. These organic products can be utilized as chemical raw materials as well as alternative fuel. Additionally, to identify the remaining components after heat treatment at 600 °C, the chemical analysis was performed using the EDX technique. The residue compositions after heat treatment at 600 °C were C, Ti, Ba, Pb, Si, Ca, Fe, and S, chiefly corresponding to TiO2, SiO2, CaO, Fe2O3 as pigments and BaSO4 as a filler. Thus, the removal of these inorganic components remaining after thermal de-coating process should be considered to maintain melting cleanliness.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polymeric coatings on aluminum scrap using TGA and Py-GC/MS, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent product selectivity, and detailed chemical analysis of pyrolysis products."
"Combined UV-irradiation and pyrolysis-GC/MS approach for evaluating the deterioration behavior of ethylene vinyl acetate Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), commonly used to encapsulate photovoltaic (PV) modules, deteriorates on prolonged exposure to sunlight. In this work, fresh and deteriorated EVA samples prepared by UV irradiation (500 W m−2) over different periods (0–168 h) are characterized by conventional elemental analysis, microscopic observations, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and micro-UV irradiation combined Py-GC/MS (UV/Py-GC/MS) to investigate the deterioration behavior of EVA, using in-situ identification of gases liberated during UV irradiation, such as H2O, CO2, ketones, acetic acid, and lactones. In addition, the deterioration of the thermal stability on aging is confirmed using evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS). UV/Py-GC/MS revealed that acetaldehyde, acetone, acetic acid, γ-butyrolactone, succinic anhydride, and cyclobutanone are produced during UV irradiation. In addition, Py-GC/MS identified cyclopentanone, citraconic anhydride, γ-valerolactone, and cyclobutanone from the UV deteriorated EVA samples, which suggested the presence of ketone and lactone structures in the deteriorated EVA. This work establishes the combined usage of UV irradiation and Py-GC/MS as a promising method to investigate UV deterioration behavior in greater detail. These findings may contribute to a superior understanding of the breakdown of PV modules by the deterioration of EVA, and lead to the development of UV-resistant encapsulating materials.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastic EVA using Py-GC/MS with measurable product identification and yield-related analysis, conducted in a lab-scale experimental setup with analytical characterization."
"Wood/plastic copyrolysis in an auger reactor: Chemical and physical analysis of the products Previous studies observed that slow copyrolysis of wood and plastic in enclosed autoclaves produced an upgraded raw bio-oil with increased hydrogen content. We now demonstrate that fast simultaneous pyrolyses of 50:50, w/w, pine wood/waste plastics in a 2kg/h lab scale auger-fed reactor at 1atm, with a short vapor residence time, generates higher heating value upgraded bio-oils. Three plastics: polystyrene (PS), high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were individually copyrolyzed with southern yellow pine wood at 525, 450 and 450°C, respectively, to generate modified bio-oils upon condensation. These liquids exhibited higher carbon and hydrogen contents, significantly lower oxygen contents, higher heats of combustion and lower water contents, acid values and viscosities than pine bio-oil. The formation of cross-over wood/plastic reaction products was negligible in the oils. Simultaneous pyrolysis process design requires using a temperature at which the plastic’s thermal decomposition kinetics produce vapors rapidly enough to prevent vaporized plastic from condensing on wood chars and exiting the reactor.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (PS, HDPE, PP) with wood in an auger reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed chemical and physical analysis of the resulting bio-oils."
"Dechlorination and upgrading of waste plastics pyrolysis oil over MWW and TUN zeolites Pyrolysis is a promising technique for converting waste plastics into oil, but the resulting liquid often contains halogens, particularly chlorine, which pose environmental and corrosion risks when used as fuel or refinery feedstock. These halogens primarily originate from materials such as PVC and other Cl-containing compounds present in the waste. This study evaluates the performance of several zeolites (TNU-9, MCM-22, MCM-49, MCM-56, and MCM-36) in the catalytic dehalogenation and upgrading of a real pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastics with a chlorine content of 290 ppm. Experiments were conducted using a fixed-bed catalytic reactor at 450 °C. All the tested catalysts improved the oil properties, decreasing its paraffin content and favouring the formation of aromatic, cyclic and olefinic hydrocarbons. This is positive regarding the possible use of this oil fraction in the formulation of transportation fuels or as a source of raw chemicals. The deepest modification was observed over MCM-36 zeolite, achieving the highest cracking activity into light olefins (mainly C3 and C4). Its superior performance is attributed to its high external surface area, mesopore volume, and accessible Brønsted acid sites, resulting from its pillarized structure. Moreover, MCM-36 was also the zeolite exhibiting the best oil dechlorination capability, which remained relatively stable along the time on stream in contrast to other zeolite catalysts. Analyses of the spent catalysts indicated that the deposited carbonaceous matter accumulates most of the Cl-containing species removed from the oil; hence, the overall oil upgrading process can be considered a combination of catalytic and adsorption effects. This material could be effectively regenerated by a sequential combination of Soxhlet extraction and calcination treatments.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of oil composition and catalyst performance."
"High quality liquid fuel production from waste plastics via two-step cracking route in a bottom-up approach using bi-functional Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst Plastic waste is a serious menace to the world due to its fastest growth rate of ~ 5% per annum and requires efficient technologies for its safe disposal. Plastic liquefaction producing liquid hydrocarbons is an effective way to dispose waste plastics in an eco-friendly manner. In present study, high quality liquid fuel is produced from waste plastics via two-step bottom-up cracking approach. A comparative analysis of liquid products obtained in thermal and catalytic cracking performed at relatively lower temperature (350 °C) with minimal catalyst to plastic feed ratio (1:30) has been studied. Catalytic cracking via two-step bottom-up route provides higher fraction of fuel range hydrocarbons in comparison to the thermal cracking. Catalytic cracking is performed using two different catalysts; HZSM-5 and 5%Fe/HZSM-5 in which later results in higher liquid yield (76 wt%) than former (60 wt%) having comparable fuel characteristics. GC–MS results confirm that liquid product obtained via catalytic cracking contains higher fraction of fuel range hydrocarbons (C6-C20); 66.39% for 5%Fe/HZSM-5 and 47.33% for HZSM-5 which is comparatively higher than that obtained in thermal cracking (27.39%). FT-IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic studies confirm that liquid hydrocarbons obtained via catalytic cracking have comparable chemical characteristics with fuel range hydrocarbons. Physiochemical properties of catalysts are studied using XRD, XPS, BET, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, NH3-TPD and H2-TPR techniques and correlated with activity results. Analysis of commercial diesel fuel is also incorporated to compare the fuel characteristics of liquid products.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst, with measurable product yields, GC–MS analysis of fuel-range hydrocarbons, and detailed experimental characterization."
"Experimental and kinetic study of PET pyrolysis under fast and slow heating rates using a visualized Macro TGA A visualized macro thermogravimetric analyzer was utilized to gather data on sample weight, temperature, and image signals of centimeter-scale PET. The PET was subjected to both fast (above 300 K/min) and slow (below 25 K/min) heating rates. The experimental findings revealed that weight loss mainly occurred at different temperature ranges under fast (above 610 °C) and slow (400–520 °C) heating rates. The isoconversional method (ICM) and the distributed activation energy model (DAEM), both assuming single-step reactions, were employed separately to predict the conversion and rate of PET pyrolysis. However, the prediction error was considerable. To address this issue, a discrete distributed activation energy model (DDAEM) was developed, incorporating both single-step and double-step parallel reactions. The DDAEM yielded a prediction error within 10 %, which is better than ICM and DDAEM. Furthermore, all three models (ICM, DAEM, and DDAEM) indicated significant discrepancies in activation energies between fast and slow heating rates.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of PET plastic using a visualized Macro TGA, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and kinetic analysis of pyrolysis behavior."
"Thermal conversion of waste polyolefins to the mixture of hydrocarbons in the reactor with molten metal bed Energy crisis and environmental degradation by polymer wastes have been imperative to find and propose technologies for recovery of raw materials and energy from non-conventional sources like organic wastes, plastic wastes, scrap tires, etc. A variety of methods and processes connected with global or national policies have been proposed worldwide. A new type of a tubular reactor with the molten metal bed is proposed for conversion of waste plastics to fuel like mixture of hydrocarbons. The results of the thermal degradation of polyolefins in the laboratory scale set-up based on this reactor are presented in the paper. The melting and cracking processes were carried out in a single apparatus at the temperature 390–420°C. The problems with: disintegration of wastes, heat transfer from the wall to the particles of polymers, cooking at the walls of reactor, and mixing of the molten volume of wastes were significantly reduced. The final product consisted of gaseous stream (8–16wt% of the input) and liquid (84–92wt%) stream. No solid products were produced. The light, “gasoline” fraction of the liquid hydrocarbons mixture (C4–C10) made over 50% of the liquid product. It may by used for fuel production or electricity generation.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (a type of plastic) in a tubular reactor with a molten metal bed, reporting measurable product yields (84–92 wt% liquid, 8–16 wt% gas) and composition (C4–C10 fraction >50%), with defined temperature conditions (390–420°C)."
"TG-FTIR-Py-GCMS analysis and catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of textile waste by red mud catalyst for liquid fuel production The substantial generation of textile waste (TW) and red mud (RM) has resulted in significant resource wastage and environmental challenges. Co-utilization technology of solid waste is an effective approach to improve waste utilization efficiency. In this study, RM catalytic pyrolysis experiments of TW were conducted using TG-FTIR and Py-GC–MS for liquid fuel production, and TW and RM were recycled simultaneously. At the optimal experimental conditions (temperature of 600 °C and feed catalyst ratio of 2:1), the tar yield and higher heating value (HHV) of TW pyrolysis catalyzed by RM were 73.43 wt% and 32.34 kJ/g, respectively. Additionally, experiments on the pyrolysis of various TW types revealed that LDPE and PP are suitable for tar production, while cotton, nylon, and PET are more suitable as feedstock for syngas production. The RM catalytic pyrolysis mechanism of textile waste is that Fe2O3 in RM exhibits significant catalytic activity in enhancing tar and syngas yields. However, during the catalytic process, Fe2O3 undergoes reduction to Fe3O4, resulting in diminished catalytic performance of the RM. After five cycles of use, the RM essentially lost its catalytic activity due to the accumulation of char and tar. All experimental findings of this study could offer an effective guideline for TW recycle and promoting RM utilization toward the waste-to-energy circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste textiles (a type of plastic and polymer waste) using red mud catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization via TG-FTIR and Py-GC–MS."
"Characteristics of a new type continuous two-stage pyrolysis of waste polyethylene Waste polyethylene (PE) was pyrolyzed in a continuous two-stage pyrolysis process having auger and fluidized bed reactors. The main aim of the study was to produce a pyrolysis gas containing high contents of olefins along with a clean pyrolysis oil at moderate reaction conditions. In the experiment, the temperatures of the auger and fluidized bed reactors were varied from 30 to 300 °C and from 653 to 736 °C, and a CaO hot filter was used to capture HCl liberated during pyrolysis. At elevated auger reactor temperatures, the PE molecules in the reactor shifted to higher vibrational energy states, resulting in the weakening of the CC bond of PE molecule. The PE melt leaving the auger reactor could finally be decomposed into short chains in the fluidized bed reactor. The total yield of ethene, propene, and 1,3-butadiene was 30–53 wt.%. The olefin yield increased with increasing auger reactor temperature. The highest gas (74.6 wt.%) and ethene (34.5 wt.%) yields were obtained when N2 was used as the fluidizing medium. Pyrolysis oil, whose yield was 15–38 wt.%, was mostly composed of aromatic hydrocarbons. The CaO hot filter could reduce the chlorine content in the pyrolysis oil to 66.5 ppm.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polyethylene in a continuous two-stage reactor system with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Catalytic coprocessing of coal and petroleum residues with waste plastics to produce transportation fuels Coprocessing reactions with waste plastics, petroleum residues and coal were performed to determine the individual and blended behavior of these materials using lower pressure and cheaper catalysts. The plastic used in this study was polypropylene. The thermodegradative behavior of polypropylene (PP) and PP/petroleum residues/coal blends were investigated in the presence of solid hydrocracking (HC) catalysts. A comparison among various catalysts has been performed on the basis of observed temperatures. The higher temperatures of initial weight loss of PP shifted to lower values by the addition of petroleum residues and coal. The catalysts were also tested in a fixed-bed micro reactor for the pyrolysis of polypropylene, petroleum residues and coal, alone and blended together in nitrogen and hydrogen atmosphere. High yields of liquid fuels in the boiling range 100–480°C and gases were obtained along with a small amount of heavy oils and insoluble material such as gums and coke. The results obtained on the coprocessing of polypropylene with coal and petroleum residues are very encouraging as this method appears to be quite feasible to convert plastic materials into liquefied coal products and to upgrade the petroleum residues and waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed micro reactor experiments on polypropylene waste plastic with petroleum residues and coal, reporting measurable yields of liquid fuels, gases, and catalyst performance under defined conditions."
"Physicochemical synergistic effect of microwave-assisted Co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics by thermal degradation, thermodynamics, numerical simulation, kinetics, and products analysis Understanding the physicochemical synergistic effect of microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis (MACP) of biomass and waste plastics is crucial for efficient conversion and improving the quality of bio-oil. Thermal degradation, thermodynamics, and numerical simulation of co-pyrolysis of the corncob (CC) and polystyrene (PS) were conducted. Results showed that the co-pyrolysis of CC and PS had a positive physical synergistic and compatible effect in reducing energy consumption and accelerating reaction rate. The reaction kinetics analysis and pyrolysis products analysis found that the co-pyrolysis of CC and PS had a positive chemical synergistic effect. The co-pyrolysis both effectively reduced the pyrolysis activation energy and improved the yield and quality of bio-oil. Significantly, the sample of CC/PS (1:2) had the highest yield of bio-oil (52.3 wt%) and the highest relative content of aromatics (95.0 area%) in co-pyrolysis, while 450 °C was the most ideal pyrolysis temperature. This work indicated that the MACP of CC and PS showed a positive physicochemical synergistic effect, and provided theories and approaches for the production of bio-oil from the biomass and waste plastics by MACP.","The study involves microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (polystyrene) and biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene: A comparison between pillared and restructured clays In this work, three restructured smectite clays, namely a saponite, a montmorillonite, and a beidellite, as well as their Al- and Fe/Al-pillared derivatives, have been tested for their performance in the catalytic cracking of a medium-density polyethylene. All reduce the cracking process temperature to 300°C, as compared with >650°C for uncatalysed pyrolysis. Although generally less active than a selected H-ZSM5 (Si/Al=235) zeolite, they are instead superior to this catalyst as regards liquid hydrocarbon formation. Different products categories can be obtained by different catalysts: in particular a choice between aliphatics and aromatics products can be made by utilising the appropriate catalysts.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of medium-density polyethylene, a waste plastic, using lab-scale experiments with measurable product yields and catalyst performance analysis."
"Waste plastics recycling for producing high-value carbon nanotubes: Investigation of the influence of Manganese content in Fe-based catalysts Thermo-chemical conversion is a promising technology for the recycle of waste plastics, as it can produce high-value products such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen. However, the low yield of CNTs is one of the challenges. In this work, the addition of Mn (0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.%) to Fe-based catalyst to improve the production of CNTs has been investigated. Results show that the increase of Mn content from 0 wt.% to 10 wt.% significantly promotes CNTs yield formed on the catalyst from 23.4 wt.% to 32.9 wt.%. The results show that Fe-particles in the fresh catalysts are between 10−25 nm. And the addition of Mn in the Fe-based catalyst enhanced the metal-support interactions and the dispersion of metal particles, thus leading to the improved catalytic performance in relation to filamentous carbon growth. In addition, the graphitization of CNTs is promoted with the increase of Mn content. Overall, in terms of the quantity and quality of the produced CNTs, 5 wt.% of Mn in Fe-based catalyst shows the best catalytic performance, due to the further increase of Mn content from 5 wt.% to 10 wt.% led to a dramatic decrease of purity by 10 wt.%.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics using Fe-based catalysts with varying Mn content, reporting measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and characterization of carbon nanotubes."
"Co-pyrolysis of coffee-grounds and waste polystyrene foam: Synergistic effect and product characteristics analysis Coffee-grounds (CFs) are simultaneously pyrolyzed with waste polystyrene foam (PS) in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor according to the following conditions: a temperature of 500 °C selected from the thermogravimetric analyses of CFs and PS, the nitrogen flow rate of about 20–25 L/min., and the feeding rate of 200 g/h. Multiple CFs/PS mixing ratios were treated as follows: 75:25, 50:50, 25:75. The properties, the chemical compositions of the co-pyrolysis oils and the yields of the products were compared with those of the pyrolysis-oils of the individual feedstocks to demonstrate the synergy between the CFs and the PS. The synergy with the co-pyrolysis produced a higher liquid yield than the calculated amount. The higher heating value of co-pyrolysis oils increased to 39.66 MJ/kg, which was equivalent to that of conventional fuels. Blending at least 25% of PS to CFs could greatly reduce the viscosity of CFs pyrolysis oil (from 724.65cP to 29.3cP at 24 °C). Chemical distributions have shown that the synergy effect between CFs and PS has drastically enhanced the production of hydrocarbons, especially in aromatic compounds.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste polystyrene foam (a plastic) with coffee grounds in a fluidized bed reactor, reporting measurable product yields, synergistic effects, and detailed chemical composition analysis of the oils."
"Mechanism of soot and particulate matter formation during high temperature pyrolysis and gasification of waste derived from MSW This research investigates the formation mechanism of soot and particulate matter during the pyrolysis and gasification of waste derived from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a laboratory scale drop tube furnace. Compared with CO2 gasification atmosphere, more ultrafine particles (PM0.2, aerodynamic diameter less than 0.2 μm) were generated in N2 atmosphere at 1200℃, which were mainly composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), graphitic carbonaceous soot and volatile alkali salts. High reaction temperatures promote the formation of hydrocarbon gaseous products and their conversion to PAHs, which ultimately leads to the formation of soot particles. The soot particles generated by waste derived from MSW pyrolysis and gasification both have high specific surface area and well-developed pore structure. Compared with pyrolysis, the soot generated by gasification of waste derived from MSW had smaller size and higher proportion of inorganic components. The higher pyrolysis temperature led to the collapse of the mesoporous structure of submicron particles, resulting in a decrease in total pore volume and an increase in specific surface area. Innovatively, this research provides an explanation for the effect of reaction temperature/ CO2 on the formation pathways and physicochemical properties of soot and fine particulate matter.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste derived from municipal solid waste, with measurable product characteristics including ultrafine particle formation, PAHs, and soot composition analyzed under varying temperatures and atmospheres."
"Dechlorination during pyrolysis of plastics: Effect of municipal plastic waste composition In order to close the loop in chemical recycling via pyrolysis, products must meet strict limits for halogen content to be used in conventional petrochemical processes. By integrating dechlorination as an integral part of pyrolysis, results show that the efficiency of dechlorination, both via stepwise pyrolysis and dechlorination agents, is significantly decreased in the presence of PET or cellulose in the feedstock. Product analysis showed that Cl reacts with formed oxygenated substances, some of which remain in the reactor during the 1st step at 350 °C and subsequently pass into the final liquid product. This increases the requirements for applied dechlorinating agents during the 2nd pyrolysis step. Novel agents have to therefore cope with a wide range of chlorinated hydrocarbons. By combining acidic β-zeolite with alkali hydrotalcite in a 1:1 ratio, a synergic effect towards dechlorination was observed, increasing individual efficiency by about 12% and 6%, respectively. Combining stepwise pyrolysis, which removed 38% of Cl on average, with the mentioned mixture of agents, 95% efficiency and 12.2 ± 1.2 ppm of Cl were obtained in the final liquid product. Such a level of dechlorination may be sufficient, considering that the pyrolysis liquid will be diluted in conventional petrochemical feedstocks.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste with measurable dechlorination efficiency, product yields, and catalyst performance data."
"Effects of oxygen, catalyst and PVC on the formation of PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs in pyrolysis products of automobile residues End-of-life vehicles are dismantled to recover reusable parts and then sent to a shredding facility for steel material recovery. The residue generated from the shredding process, so-called automobile shredder residue, is now being mostly disposed in landfill, however landfill will be prohibited in the near future. More recycling and energy recovery must be made by the regulation. The most appropriate method is the thermal treatment that will produce various forms of fuels and less volume of vitrified residue. In this research, an automobile shredder residue was simulated with considering the residue from a shredding factory based on the new vehicle and thermally treated by pyrolysis or gasification to observe the yields of gas, oil and char. In the temperature range of 400–800°C, the yields of gas, oil, and char were 38.7–45.8%, 12.3–18.2%, and 36.0–49.0%, respectively. The optimum pyrolyzing temperature for more oil production was around 600°C. Emission characteristics of the byproducts, PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs were studied at the temperature of 600°C. The analysis on the concentration and distribution of the isomers in various forms of the products were completed with and without oxygen, PVC, and catalytic metals, in order to observe how the existence of oxygen, PVC, and catalytic metals affect the formation of PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs from pyrolysis or gasification process. Without PVC, no PCDDs, PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs were found in any products. PCDFs were predominant in any conditions. Catalyst and oxygen were found to affect to form more PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like PCBs. Effects of catalyst and oxygen on the byproduct formation seemed to be similar in oil and gas while that was different in char.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue, a waste plastic-containing feedstock, with measured product yields and detailed analysis of byproduct formation under varying conditions."
"Pyrolysis of HDPE into fuel like products: Evaluating catalytic performance of plain and metal oxides impregnated waste brick kiln dust The work explores the catalytic activities of plain and metal oxides (Fe2O3, CoO, ZnO, MnO2 and NiO) impregnated waste brick kiln dust (WBKD) for pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in order to get useful liquid oil that can be used as substitute to petro-fuels. The catalysts prepared in the laboratory were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-rays (EDX) analysis, surface area analysis (SAA) and x-ray diffractometry (XRD). The conversion of HDPE into liquid oil (LO) as a function of concentration of catalysts was studied. Based on the yielding results, ZnO- impregnated WBKD (5%) was found to be highly active. The liquid oils obtained in the thermal and ZnO-impregnated WBKD catalyzed runs were analyzed by using fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). While comparing the results with the un-catalyzed thermal run, the ZnO-impregnated WBKD altered the liquid oil composition in terms of carbon range and hydrocarbon group type distributions. The fuel properties of the resultant liquid oils showed fuel values resembling to the generic petro-fuels.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic using catalytic and thermal methods, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of the resulting oil."
"Catalytic microwave conversion of LDPE–PET waste: Unravelling the influence of process parameters Catalytic Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (CMAP) is emerging as a highly efficient and sustainable thermochemical strategy for valorising plastic waste into high-value fuels and chemicals, addressing critical environmental burdens. This study investigates the CMAP of a binary thermoplastic blend comprising low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in a 1:1 (wt./wt.) ratio under variable process parameters: microwave power (270, 450, 630 W), susceptor dosage (5, 10, 15 g activated carbon), and catalyst loading (5, 10, 15 g zeolite). Product yields were 30–45 wt% for pyrolytic oils, 20–35 wt% for permanent gases, and 25–40 wt% for char. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of liquid products identified dominant C–H stretching, carbonyl (CO), and aromatic CC bands, indicative of complex aliphatic, oxygenated, and aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks. GC–MS profiling revealed power-dependent chemical distributions: aliphatic hydrocarbons (30–50 wt%) dominated at 270 W, mono- and polyaromatics (25–35 wt%) were prevalent at 450 W, while oxygenated species including furans and cyclopentenones (15–25 wt%) increased at 630 W. Phenolic derivatives were also identified across conditions. Carbon number distribution spanned C7–C25, with a peak in the C10–C15 fraction at 450 W, consistent with intensified chain scission and secondary cracking. Higher power promoted formation of lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (C7–C10), indicating enhanced thermal decomposition.","The study involves catalytic microwave pyrolysis of waste LDPE and PET, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis using GC–MS and FTIR."
"Co-pyrolysis for dual benefits: Enhanced oil quality from waste tires/plastics and detoxification of chromium slag Waste chromium slag (WCs) optimized the pyrolysis behavior and product distribution of waste tires (WTs)/waste plastics (WPs) through catalysis. Concurrently, WCs were efficiently reduced and detoxified by the pyrolysis volatiles, establishing a synergistic co-treatment mechanism for toxic and waste materials. This study employed thermogravimetric-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and tube furnace pyrolysis experiments for multi-dimensional analysis. Results revealed that WCs introduction lowered the initial pyrolysis temperature, inhibited chlorine-containing functional groups (H-Cl and C-Cl) formation, and enhanced liquid-phase product yield. Most notably, WCs exhibited pronounced catalytic cracking effects, promoting selective enrichment of light components (C5-C12), with their proportion increasing from 27.6 % to 51.9 %. Meanwhile, sulfur and chlorine elements in WTs and WPs underwent targeted migration during pyrolysis, partly were adsorbed by solid phase residues. Consequently, sulfur content reduced from 39.4 % to 24.6 %, and chlorine content from 2.7 % to 1.0 % in liquid products. Additionally, WTs, WPs, and their mixtures (WTs/WPs) all demonstrated excellent reduction efficiency for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), with rates reaching 94.0 % under optimal conditions. This work clarifies the catalytic function of WCs in pyrolysis systems, providing innovative technical pathways for high-value resource utilization of WTs/WPs and harmless synergistic treatment of WCs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics and tires with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of oil composition and elemental reduction."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste coconut fibers and polystyrene using Py-GC-MS: Effect of temperatures and catalyst loading on pyrolytic hot vapours This present study investigates the catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste coconut shells (CNS) and polystyrene (PS) using Py-GC-MS to evaluate the effect of temperature and catalyst loading on pyrolytic vapour products. CNS was characterised by 75.51 % volatile matter, 14 % fixed carbon, 5.6 % moisture content, 4.86 % ash, 49 % carbon, and 18.32 MJ kg−1 higher heating value, while PS exhibited 99 % volatile matter, 92 % carbon, and 40.52 MJ kg−1 energy content. Co-pyrolysis was conducted at 450, 550, and 650 °C with varied PS (10–30 wt%) and ZSM-5 catalyst loadings (10–30 wt%). Pyrolysis of CNS alone at 650 °C produced 10.49 % hydrocarbons, 30.34 % acids, and 16.52 % phenols, while PS produced up to 95.61 % hydrocarbons at 550 °C. When blended, 30 % PS with CNS yielded up to 64 % hydrocarbons and 14 % acids at 650 °C, highlighting the synergistic effect. Catalyst addition significantly improved hydrocarbon yields: at 10 wt% ZSM-5 and 650 °C, hydrocarbon yield reached 33 %, with decreased acid and phenol content, enhancing oil quality. FTIR confirmed the presence of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and aromatic groups, whereas TGA confirmed thermal decomposition stages of CNS and PS. The highest conversion efficiency was observed at 650 °C with 30 wt% PS and 10 wt% ZSM-5, driven by cracking, decarboxylation, and aromatisation reactions. The study demonstrates that integrating waste plastics with biomass and ZSM-5 in co-pyrolysis enhances hydrocarbon-rich oil production while mitigating environmental issues from biomass burning and plastic waste. This process presents a sustainable pathway for converting lignocellulosic and polymeric waste into renewable fuel.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) and biomass, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Pyrolysis behavior and synergistic effect on co-pyrolysis of rice straw and polystyrene The co-pyrolysis of rice straw (RS) and polystyrene (PS) enhances the quality of bio-oil. In this study, the thermal decomposition behavior, kinetic behavior, and product distribution during RS–PS co-pyrolysis were systematically investigated. Kinetic parameters (A, E, n) were evaluated using OFW, KAS, STK, CR, and MP methods, while product distributions were analyzed via Py-GC/MS at 600 °C. Synergistic effects were quantified using deviations between experimental and theoretical values (ΔW, ΔWE, ΔWP). Results showed that RS decomposes in three stages and PS in a single step, whereas co-pyrolysis proceeds through four distinct stages. The presence of PS delayed RS pyrolysis, attributed to reduced heat transfer caused by molten PS (ΔW < 0 at 330–460 °C). The addition of PS significantly lowered the apparent activation energy, with the RS5PS5 blend exhibiting a strong synergistic effect (ΔWE = –19.5 kJ/mol, KAS). Kinetic modeling revealed that RS follows a multi-step D3 mechanism, while PS conforms to a single-step F1 model. Product analysis demonstrated that increasing PS content enhances the yields of mono- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, while reducing aliphatic and oxygenated compounds. In the RS7PS3 blend, MAHs and PAHs reached 62.55 % and 29.76 %, respectively, highlighting a substantial shift in product composition due to synergistic interactions. These findings highlight co-pyrolysis as an effective method for improving bio-oil quality and addressing plastic waste.","The study investigates the co-pyrolysis of polystyrene, a waste plastic, with rice straw using experimental methods including Py-GC/MS analysis and kinetic modeling, with measurable product yields and composition data reported."
"Temperature-dependent highly active LaCaMgAl2O4 catalyst effect on carbon nanomaterial and hydrogen generation from polymethyl methacrylate plastic The increasing accumulation of waste polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plastics presents a significant environmental challenge, while the demand for renewable energy sources continues to rise. Thermochemical recycling is a prospective technique for converting waste plastics into high-value chemicals, both economically and environmentally. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste PMMA plastics over LaCaMgAl2O4 nanosheets (NSs) catalyst is being investigated for its potential to produce hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The yield and purity of the gaseous products, as well as carbon deposition, concerning the effects of temperature during the catalysis process. Additionally, a small portion of LaCa was incorporated into the MgAl2O4 composite in the pre-catalysts under investigation. Analyzing the physicochemical properties of the carbon nanomaterials that form provides valuable insights into the workings of different catalysts. It's noteworthy that LaCaMgAl2O4 NSs showed such large yields of H2 (82.71 vol% H2) and CNTs (388 mg g−1) at 750 °C. The LaCaMgAl2O4 NSs catalyst's impressive ability to produce CNTs and H2 gas at high yields underscores its efficacy and potential for real-world catalytic pyrolysis applications. This study emphasizes the Nanocatalyst's potential for large-scale catalytic pyrolysis operations, providing a workable and efficient way of converting waste plastics into high-value products and renewable energy.","The study investigates catalytic pyrolysis of waste PMMA plastic in a fixed-bed reactor, reporting measurable yields of hydrogen (82.71 vol%) and carbon nanotubes (388 mg g−1) at 750 °C, with detailed product analysis and catalyst performance evaluation."
"Exploring the catalytic conversion of pyrolytic wax residue: Kinetics and co-pyrolysis This study explores the valorization of pyrolysis waxy residue (PWR), a semi-solid byproduct remaining after the distillation of lighter fractions from paper and plastic waste derived pyrolysis oil, with the aim of optimizing hydrocarbon production. Three strategies were assessed: (1) co-pyrolysis of PWR with sawdust (SD) at varying ratios, (2) catalytic pyrolysis using molecular sieves (MS) and ZSM-5 catalysts, and (3) catalytic co-pyrolysis combining PWR, SD, and catalysts. Thermal decomposition analysis of the PWR revealed maximum volatile release, with complete conversion achieved at 550 °C. Kinetic parameters were estimated using Coats Redfern method and the activation energy was found in the range of 31.3 – 38.9 mol−1 (avg: 35.3 mol−1). Non catalytic fixed-bed co-pyrolysis at the optimum temperature of 550 ˚C showed a 3:1 PWR-to-SD ratio maximizing the hydrocarbon content (79.0 %) but resulted in low oil yields of (∼13 %,). In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis of PWR with MS resulted in a significantly higher hydrocarbon yield with negligible phenolic compounds, while ZSM-5 enhanced the gas production to 32.5 % but slightly reduced hydrocarbon yield to 65.9 %. Catalytic co-pyrolysis using MS provided higher oil yields of ∼40 % with hydrocarbon content at 71.0 %. Despite the challenge of converting long-chain hydrocarbons into oily sludge, the findings highlight the potential for complete conversion and maximized liquid yields through catalysts and co-pyrolysis with biomass mixtures.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic and co-pyrolysis of plastic-derived pyrolytic wax residue, with measurable yields, temperature-dependent results, and catalyst performance data."
"Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of a real mixture of post-consumer plastic waste: An analysis of the gasoline-range product In this work, the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of different types of plastic waste and a real mixture were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor over different catalysts (CaO, MgO, HY, HZSM-5). Important differences in gas, liquid, and solid yields were found as a function of polymer type. The highest gas yield was obtained with expanded polystyrene (52.3%), and the maximum oil production with high-impact polystyrene (55.5%), while polypropylene film led to the highest char release (17.5%). Regarding the composition of the liquid oil, high-impact polystyrene showed the highest yield of gasoline-range product (426 g per kg of pyrolyzed plastic), mainly composed of aromatics compounds (90%). The addition of catalysts increased the gas yield to the detriment of the oil produced. The effect was more evident for zeolite-type catalysts, i.e., the gas yield raised from 43.3 (non-catalytic) to 51.5% (HZSM-5). Low influence on the oil composition, i.e., gasoline-range product, was detected. This can be explained by the fast deactivation of catalysts because of coke deposition. Only an increase in the fraction of gasoline in liquid oil was observed when low-cost catalysts (CaO and MgO) were used, without significant changes in the composition of this product.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of real post-consumer plastic waste with measurable yields, catalyst effects, and product composition analysis."
"Simultaneous thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and pyrolysis—gas chromatography of fluorocarbon polymers The thermal degradation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene copolymer (FEP) has been investigated in different gas atmospheres by simultaneous thermogravimetry—mass spectrometry, pyrolysis—gas chromatography, combined gas chromatography—mass spectrometry, and IR analysis. There are no significant differences in the decomposition products of the two polymers in helium or air at a temperature range of 450–790°C; C1 to C8 fluorocarbons and their oxidized products have been identified. The various fluorocarbons produced are plotted against the degradation temperature, and at temperatures of 450–550°C FEP evolves large amounts of tetrafluoroethylene formed by a decomposition reaction of perfluoropropylene. From the traces of the TG-MS in an atmosphere of helium, the FEP clearly decomposes in two stages. The first stage degradation is mostly attributed to the evolution of perfluoropropylene with a small amount of perfluoro-1-butene or perfluoroisobutylene, and possibly traces of perfluorocyclobutane. Tetrafluoroethylene is evolved with these fluorocarbons at the second stage degradation, showing similar characteristics of the degradation mechanisms of FEP at the two stages. In the presence of air, the two polymers also decompose in two stages. Activation energies for the degradation products are calculated, and the decomposition mechanisms of the polymers are discussed with the results of IR analysis.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of commercial fluorocarbon polymers (PTFE and FEP) using lab-scale techniques like TG-MS, pyrolysis-GC, and GC-MS, with measurable product yields and temperature-dependent decomposition data."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate over two stage calcium oxide-ZSM-5 This study examined the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate over basic calcium oxide and acid zeolites, such as HY (SiO2/Al2O3: 30), Hβ (25), HZSM-5 (23), to maximize the yields of aromatics using thermogravimetric analysis and tandem μ-reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The maximum decomposition temperature of polyethylene terephthalate on the catalytic thermogravimetric analysis over HZSM-5 (452 °C) was reduced by co-feeding with yellow poplar wood to 444 °C because of its catalytic property and the effective interaction between the catalytic co-pyrolysis intermediates of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate. Non-catalytic co-pyrolysis produced smaller amounts of large molecular polyethylene terephthalate pyrolyzates because of the more effective secondary cracking and deoxygenation. Calcium oxide was effective in the deacidification and acid zeolites were efficient in aromatics production during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate. Among the acid zeolites, HZSM-5 showed the highest efficiency on benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEXs) production, followed by Hβ and HY because of its strong acidity and proper pore size. The experimental MS intensities of BTEXs obtained from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate over HZSM-5 (1083 × 106) were larger than their theoretical value (998 × 106). Compared to the single stage catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar wood and polyethylene terephthalate over ex-situ HZSM-5, the two-stage catalytic co-pyrolysis over in-situ calcium oxide and ex-situ HZSM-5 produced the much larger amounts of BTEXs during seven times sequential experiments.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (a waste plastic) with biomass, including measured product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of BTEXs via tandem μ-reactor-GC/MS."
"Pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a fluidised bed reactor. Influence of the temperature and residence time The pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidised bed reactor was performed and the influence of the temperature and the residence time on the product distribution and gas composition investigated. Experiments at five different temperatures, 650; 685; 730; 780 and 850°C were carried out and the residence time was varied from 0.64 to 2.6 s. A total number of 20 runs were performed. Polyethylene was fed continuously into the bed and nitrogen was used as carrier gas and as fluidising agent. The results obtained showed the effect of these operating parameters on the production and composition of gases, oil and waxes. The temperature and residence time had a great influence on the pyrolysis product distribution within the range evaluated in this paper. At 640°C the main product obtained was a waxy cream coloured material (wax). The yield of this product varied from 79.7 wt.% at 0.8 s to 68.5wt.% at 1.5 s. At these conditions the gas yield varied between 11.4 wt.% at 1 s and 31.5 wt.% at 1.5 s. The waxes obtained are rich in aliphatic hydrocarbons up to C30. At high temperatures the product distribution changed drastically. The higher gas yields was obtained at 780°C, 86.4 wt.% of gas and 9.6 wt.% of oil, both at 1.34 s. The main hydrocarbons in this gas were ethylene, methane and propylene, the remaining products being oils with a high aromatic hydrocarbon (benzene and naphthalene) content. The H2, CH4, N2 and C2H x to C5H x compounds on the gas produced were analysed by gas chromatography, using a packed column and a molecular sieve.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidised bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"A comparative pyrolysis study of different waste wind turbine blade parts: Kinetics, product distribution and evolution, and economics The resource treatment and recycling of waste wind turbine blades (WWTBs) have become an important challenge globally. Considering mechanical strength during operation, the designed construction of WTBs consists of B1 (balsa-filled part), B2 (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam-filled part) and B3 (pure glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) part), whereas direct mixed treatment can generate low-quality and heterogeneous products. Current studies focused on B3 or the whole blades, but few studied the pyrolysis behavior and energy value of different parts. In this study, the comparative study of the kinetic, product distribution and evolution, and economics of different parts was conducted. Thermogravimetric and kinetic revealed the phase transitions and energy requirements during conversion. Py-GC/MS and fixed-bed experiments confirmed that B1 and B2 generated more oils and gases with more coke in the solids at 600 °C, which was related to carbonization of their core components. High O/C ratios of balsa and PET caused more oxygen-containing groups and products to be produced in the B1 and B2 reaction pathways. The high economics indicated that pyrolysis was suitable for B2 and B3, and the detailed exploration of B1 part should be continued. Our work provides application guidance for resource recovery and utilization of different WWTB parts.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste wind turbine blade parts (B1, B2, B3) made from commercial plastics (PET, GFRP, balsa), with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent behavior, and analytical characterization of products."
"Recycling of automobile shredder residue with a microwave pyrolysis combined with high temperature steam gasification Presently, there is a growing need for handling automobile shredder residues – ASR or “car fluff”. One of the most promising methods of treatment ASR is pyrolysis. Apart of obvious benefits of pyrolysis: energy and metals recovery, there is serious concern about the residues generated from that process needing to be recycled. Unfortunately, not much work has been reported providing a solution for treatment the wastes after pyrolysis. This work proposes a new system based on a two-staged process. The ASR was primarily treated by microwave pyrolysis and later the liquid and solid products become the feedstock for the high temperature gasification process. The system development is supported within experimental results conducted in a lab-scale, batch-type reactor at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The heating rate, mass loss, gas composition, LHV and gas yield of producer gas vs. residence time are reported for the steam temperature of 1173K. The sample input was 10g and the steam flow rate was 0.65kg/h. The conversion reached 99% for liquids and 45–55% for solids, dependently from the fraction. The H2:CO mol/mol ratio varied from 1.72 solids and 1.4 for liquid, respectively. The average LHV of generated gas was 15.8MJ/Nm3 for liquids and 15MJ/Nm3 for solids fuels.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue, a waste plastic feedstock, with measurable product yields, gas composition, and energy content reported."
"Thermal degradation of waste plastics under non-sweeping atmosphere: Part 2: Effect of process temperature on product characteristics and their future applications The current energy demand and diminishing conventional fuels have forced researchers to find an alternative source of energy. Waste to energy is the current trend for converting waste materials (plastic waste) into valuable fuels. This article mainly discussed the detailed characterization of the pyrolytic products, their comparative analysis and the reaction mechanism at varying operating temperature. This article is a successor of part 1, which primarily focused on the characterization of different waste plastics, their TG analysis, the effect of reactor temperature on yield analysis in a batch reactor and their detailed degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the results presented in this article report the characterization of products at three processing temperatures of 450, 500 and 550 °C. The pyrolytic oils from all wastes excluding PS show a very low density ranging from 0.71 to 0.76 kg/m3, whereas PS pyrolytic density is reported between 0.86 and 0.88 kg/m3. The viscosity of oils increases with an increase in the processing temperature and is similar to the conventional fuels. The FTIR analysis of the products (oil & gases) obtained from HDPE, PP and mixed plastic waste (MIX) shows a large presence of alkanes and a higher presence of aromatics. PS analysis reported a large presence of aromatics (~75%). The GC-MS analysis of all pyrolytic oils from waste plastics, simulated wastes (virgin plastics) and distilled fraction of MIX pyrolysis oil is compared. The GC analysis of non-condensable gases at all processing temperature reports that MIX produce the maximum H2; HDPE, PS and MIX produces a high amounts of CH4 too. The formation of lower hydrocarbons (C5–C12) in pyrolysis oil shows a trend as MIX > PP > PS > HDPE, while for the heavier hydrocarbons (>C19) it is HDPE > PP > PS > MIX. The potential of the utilization of these products has been discussed in different sectors for future research.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PS, MIX) at specific temperatures with measurable product yields, compositional analysis via GC-MS and FTIR, and reactor condition details."
"Recycling waste polyethylene into fuels over Fe/USY catalyst: Evaluation on the catalytic activities of varied iron states Iron-modified zeolite catalyst has a good application prospect on recycling the waste plastics into value-added fuels via catalytic pyrolysis. Distinguishing the catalytic activities of varied iron states on catalyst is crucial to catalyst designation and plastic-to-fuel process. In this work, we prepared three Fe/USY catalysts, termed Fe(O-550)/USY, Fe(R-300)/USY and Fe(R-450)/USY, that contain different iron states – Fe2O3, Fe3O4 + Fe (dominantly) and Fe respectively, and investigated their catalytic activities in polyethylene pyrolysis for fuel oils. The results show that loading of the iron species on USY zeolite decreases the catalyst acidity. H2 reduction treatment in catalyst preparation has no significant influence on the total acidity but slightly changes the concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The oil yield after catalysis with different catalysts follows the order: Fe(O-550)/USY (72.5 %) > Fe(R-300)/USY (69.9 %) > Fe(R-450)/USY (66.7 %) > USY (56.5 %). The oil includes a mixture of C6-C34 compounds especially abundant in C6-C10. It is mainly in gasoline and diesel range and consists of alkanes as majority. Generally, loading of the iron species on USY zeolite increases the oil yield and produces lighter oil and more aromatics and alkenes, while the Fe(R-450)/USY shows higher catalytic cracking activity than Fe(O-550)/USY, Fe(R-300)/USY and USY catalysts. Among the varied iron states, the metallic iron is more active than the other iron oxides to promote the catalytic cracking of PE to produce fuel oil, especially the light oil and aromatic fractions.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene using Fe/USY catalysts, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance comparison, and detailed product composition analysis."
"The effects of magnesium hydroxide on flash pyrolysis of polystyrene Pure polystyrene (PS) and flame-retarded PS composite containing magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) were pyrolyzed in a off-line furnace-type pyrolyzer at 700°C for 10min. The liquid and tar products were collected by Cambridge pad. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were carried out by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results indicate that the effects of Mg(OH)2 on flash pyrolysis of PS are quite significant. The existence of Mg(OH)2 does not lead to the appearance of new products, but the results of quantitative analysis show that the product distribution of the PS/Mg(OH)2 sample is rather different from that of the pure PS sample. Almost all the relative intensities of products, especially some head-to-head structures and some condensed aromatic compounds, take on increasing tendencies except that of styrene monomer markedly decreases. The reasons of the changes were discussed from the aspect of reaction pathways and mechanisms.","The study involves lab-scale flash pyrolysis of waste polystyrene with Mg(OH)2, reports measurable product yields and composition via GC/MS, and includes experimental reactor conditions and analytical characterization."
"Selective H2 production from plastic waste through pyrolysis and in-line oxidative steam reforming This study deals with the proposal of pyrolysis and in-line oxidative steam reforming (P-OSR) for plastic waste valorization and assesses the potential of this strategy for the selective production of H2. Overall, the study aims at progressing towards the fine-tuning of the pyrolysis-reforming technology by co-feeding O2. Thus, a multi-point O2 injection system has been developed to ensure a suitable O2 distribution in the reforming reactor and avoid the formation of hot spots, as they may cause catalyst deactivation by metal sintering. Moreover, as O2 is directly supplied into the catalytic bed, pre-combustion of the volatile stream before contacting the catalyst is avoided and in-situ coke combustion is promoted. The P-OSR of HDPE was carried out in a two-step reaction system, which combines CSBR (conical spouted bed reactor) and FBR (fluidized bed reactor) technologies. The experiments were conducted in continuous mode and the influence of the main process conditions at zero time on stream was analyzed. Thus, the effect of reforming temperature was studied in the 550–750 °C range, that of the space time from 3.12 to 15.62 gcat min gHDPE −1, steam to plastic (S/P) ratio between 2 and 5 and equivalence ratio (ER) from 0 to 0.3. Under the optimum conditions (700 °C, S/P of 3, 12.5 gcat min gHDPE −1 and ER of 0.2), a H2 production of 25.0 wt% was obtained, which is only 28.6 % lower than that obtained in the conventional pyrolysis-steam reforming (P-SR) process. The results obtained confirm the potential of continuous P-OSR process for the selective production of H2.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE plastic waste using a two-step reactor system, with measurable yields and performance data under varying process conditions."
"Upgrading of solid recovered fuel (SRF) by dechlorination and catalytic pyrolysis over nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolite Globally increasing concern related to municipal solid waste generation is encouraging research efforts on developing alternative routes to valorize mixed refused wastes. In this way, catalytic pyrolysis is emerging as an interesting and efficient technology due to its great flexibility in terms of feedstock. In the current work, upgrading of a Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) has been investigated by catalytic pyrolysis over nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolite (n-ZSM-5), paying special attention to dechlorination effects due to the high Cl content of the raw waste. Thus, pretreatment of the SRF by water washing and mild thermal processing allows for a significant reduction of the Cl concentration. Regarding the catalytic pyrolysis step, the best conditions correspond with a temperature of 400 °C in the catalyst bed and 0.50 catalyst/SRF mass ratio, which lead to ca. 30 wt% oil yield (rich in aromatic hydrocarbons) together with about 40 wt% gas yield (rich in C3–C4 olefins). Accordingly, these products could find use as raw chemicals or for the production of advanced fuels. In addition, zeolite reutilization has been tested for several cycles, denoting a progressive modification of the products distribution because of coke deposition.

"Two-step pyrolysis for waste HDPE valorization Among the implemented strategies for recycling and reutilization of HDPE, pyrolysis process is considered an attractive alternative, because its potential to use waste materials to produce valuable chemical feedstock and high energy content hydrocarbons. Through pyrolysis transformation, plastics are thermally cracked in the absence of oxygen and the reaction parameters can be controlled to favor the production of specific compounds and liquid fractions. During this project, waste HDPE thermal decomposition was evaluated in a range of 450–550 °C, considering samples of 2 mm and 5 mm and a residence time of 30 min. A design of experiments was applied to find the optimal conditions to maximize the volatile fraction. Then the waste HDPE was transformed in a two-step pyrolysis in order to maximize the volatiles fraction and the intermediate and final products analyzed. According to results, A volatile fraction equivalent to the 97 % of HDPE mass was obtained at 500 °C, with a 5 mm particle size and a hold time of 30 min. The chemical analysis of wax and oil products showed that, although both blends are similarly made of alkanes, alkenes, and dienes, the compounds found in oil are shorter-chain and in a greater variety than those found in wax.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of waste HDPE with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and defined reactor conditions."
"Comparing bed materials for fluidized bed steam cracking of high-density polyethylene: Olivine, bauxite, silica-sand, and feldspar Steam cracking in fluidized beds is an alternative method for producing valuable petrochemicals from plastic waste. Previous studies on the conversion of plastics in fluidized beds have revolved around non-catalytic cracking using silica sand as the bed material. On the other hand, studies on catalytic cracking have focused on the use of active materials such as olivine, bauxite, feldspar, and zeolites. The potential influence of the above-mentioned materials, in their natural or inactive state, on fluidized bed hydrocarbon cracking, is not well-documented in the literature. In this paper, steam cracking of polyethylene in a bubbling fluidized bed at 750 °C is investigated in the presence of four different natural ores: olivine, bauxite, silica sand, and feldspar. The paper compares the performance of the steam cracking process in terms of cracking severity, conversion, and product distribution among different hydrocarbon groups. The results show that there is only a marginal difference in cracking severity among the different bed materials, while the conversion remain relatively consistent, ranging from 93% to 95% (carbon.%). The yields of paraffins and carbon oxides are narrow, ranging from 15% to 16% and 3–4%, respectively, while the yields of light olefins and aromatics show a slightly wider range. The yield of olefins is in the range of 52–57%, and for aromatics, it ranges from 16% to 21%. The paper also discusses the potential impact of these bed materials on the cracking reactions, including their thermal and reactive interactions.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized bed steam cracking of high-density polyethylene, a waste plastic, with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data."
"Ni/SiO2 catalysts for polyolefin deconstruction via the divergent hydrogenolysis mechanism Noble metal-based hydrogenolysis is emerging as a key chemical deconstruction technology of polyolefins into valuable products. Still, the catalyst cost and availability are significant barriers to handling the large volume of plastics. Cheap earth-abundant metals have been deemed inactive for polyolefin hydrogenolysis. Herein, we report that Ni/SiO2 is active in deconstructing low-density polyethylene to n-alkanes (C6-C35) at mild conditions (300 °C, 30 bar H2) with maximum liquid yields of 65 wt%. We expose a new mechanism of long-alkane hydrogenolysis that encompasses chain location-dependent single and multiple C-C bond cracking events and rationalizes product selectivity and molecular weight dependence. Ni/SiO2 catalysts are reusable and can handle multiple plastics producing feedstock-dependent products (i.e., n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cyclics, aromatics, etc.). The findings broaden the scope of viable catalysts polyolefin hydrogenolysis and unleash the potential to manage the volume of plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene using Ni/SiO2 catalysts, with measured liquid yields (65 wt%) and detailed product analysis of n-alkanes (C6-C35) under specific reactor conditions."
"Catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene and polypropylene into liquid fuel in a powder-particle fluidized bed Catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were carried out in this work in a powder-particle fluidized bed with inside diameter of 25 mm. Two kinds of catalysts (F9; Silica/Alumina,SA) were used as medium particles fluidized by nitrogen. The yields of liquid fuel, gas product and solid residue were investigated under different operating conditions, including catalyst type, bed temperature, superficial gas velocity. The compositions of liquid and gas products were also determined by gas chromatography. Between two kinds of catalyst, SA can produce higher yield of liquid fuel and more valuable gas product under temperature range from 400 to 550°C. Over 86 wt.% conversion of liquid fuel, containing hydrocarbons from C-5 to C-11, was reached from both HDPE and PP under 500°C with a residue yield level of less than 8 wt.%. Gas product under appropriate operating conditions contains over 59 wt.% ethylene and propylene.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics HDPE and PP in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Carrier gas-mediated synergistic mechanisms and liquid phase product distribution regulation in Co-Pyrolysis of waste tires and waste plastics Compared to nitrogen (N2) as an inert medium, the weak oxidation characteristics of carbon dioxide (CO2) can induce the pre-depolymerization of macromolecular chains in waste tires (WTs) and waste plastics (WPs), simultaneously reducing pyrolysis energy consumption and increasing pyrolysis oil yield. In this paper, a comparative experimental system utilizing N2 and CO2 as carrier gases was constructed. A primary investigation was conducted on the co-pyrolysis process of WTs and WPs resulting from differences in carrier gases, and the targeted conversion of light products was systematically investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic analyses revealed that the CO2 medium reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier, driving a decrease in the initial pyrolysis temperature and activation energy. Notably, WPs (6.6 ℃, 36.3 kJ/mol) exhibited the most pronounced sensitivity to the carrier gas effect. The activation energy of the co-pyrolysis system showed a positive synergistic effect, decreasing by 3.9 kJ/mol in CO2 and 17.1 kJ/mol in N2 medium, respectively. The shifts of theoretical TG-DTG curves further confirmed that the N2-mediated synergistic strength was higher, but CO2 exhibited superior performance in reducing the kinetic energy barrier. Product characterization results indicated that the CO2 medium increased the C5-C12 fraction in the pyrolysis oil by 18.7 wt%, with the selectivity of aromatics and olefins increasing by 14.4 wt% and 13.5 wt%, respectively. Additionally, hydrogen abstraction reactions initiated by WTs promoted the WPs molecular chains to decompose at lower temperatures. These findings clarify the carrier gas-mediated chemical regulation mechanisms for solid waste pyrolysis, advancing theoretical frameworks for polymer upcycling.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and waste tires using N2 and CO2 carrier gases, with measurable product yields, kinetic analysis, and product composition data reported."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes with two different types of catalysts: ZSM-5 zeolite and Red Mud The influence of ZSM-5 zeolite and Red Mud in the pyrolysis of plastic wastes has been studied. Both catalysts have been thoroughly characterized; the zeolite shows weak and strong acid sites and great BET surface area (412.0m2 g−1), while Red Mud contains lower acidity, with also weak and strong acid sites, meso-macropores and BET surface area of 27.49m2 g−1. Both catalysts have been tested in pyrolysis of a mixture of plastics which resembles municipal plastic wastes, at 440 and 500°C in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor. The results have been compared with those of the thermal process. It has been proved that ZSM-5 zeolite has a strong effect in the characteristics and distribution of pyrolysis products. It generates at both temperatures a greater proportion of gases and liquids with a higher content of aromatics than without catalyst. Red Mud needs higher temperatures than ZSM-5 zeolite to exert a catalytic effect in pyrolysis, since similar results to those obtained without catalyst are obtained at 440°C, while at 500°C a higher yield of gases and a greater proportion of aromatics in the liquids is obtained.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste using ZSM-5 and Red Mud catalysts, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent results, and detailed product composition analysis."

Shredded tyre wastes were subjected to pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure under inert gas atmosphere in a fluidized bed combustion setup. The shredded tyre particle size, the feed rate of the feed stock, and the pyrolysis temperature were varied systematically as per the designed experiment to study their influence on product yield. Maximizing the oil yield and subduing the gas and char yield is the objective to optimize the process parameters. A low pyrolysis temperature of 440°C with low feed rate increases the residence time in the combustion reactor yielding maximum oil.

"Pyrolytic conversion of nylon-6 and red mud into N-doped carbon composite and its application into azo-dye degradation The continuous growth of the global population and industries has led to the mass generation of plastic and industrial waste, posing significant environmental challenges due to their incompatibility with conventional waste management practices. This study investigates the thermochemical conversion of plastic (nylon-6) and industrial waste (red mud) into value-added products, presenting a waste-to-resource conversion strategy. Nylon-6 and red mud were co-pyrolyzed, resulting in a metal-carbon composite characterized as porous N-doped graphitic carbon with embedded Fe0 particles. Application of the composite to an amaranth solution demonstrated its ability to activate persulfate, facilitating amaranth oxidation at a rate (k obs = 1.78 min−1) significantly higher than other Fe-based catalysts. Quenching experiments verified the generation of OH· and SO4 ·- radicals during activation, with the latter playing a dominant role in amaranth degradation. The composite exhibited robust reusability, maintaining an amaranth removal efficiency of >80 % after five reaction cycles. Additionally, red mud significantly enhanced syngas (H2 and CO) generation from nylon-6, suggesting a catalytic effect. In conclusion, the proposed thermochemical approach offers a viable method for converting waste materials into valuable products, including environmental catalysts and gas fuels.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of nylon-6 (a commercial plastic) with red mud, reporting measurable product yields, catalytic performance, and product characterization including gas generation and composite properties."
"Integrating continuous-stirred microwave pyrolysis with ex-situ catalytic upgrading for linear low-density polyethylene conversion: Effects of parameter conditions A continuous-stirred microwave pyrolysis (CSMP) reactor coupled with an ex-situ catalytic bed was developed for the conversion of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to high-grade fuels. Effects of catalyst-to-reactant ratio and feeding rate on product yield and chemical selectivity were studied. The CSMP of LLDPE produced up to 84.1 wt.% condensate product composed of hydrocarbon fuels. With the assistance of the ex-situ catalytic process with HZSM-5, more refined chemicals dominated by gasoline-range hydrocarbons (C5–C12 hydrocarbons) were observed. When the catalyst-to-reactant ratio was 15 % and the feeding rate was 6 g/min, the condensate oil with a high higher heating value (45.23 MJ/kg) showed the highest selectivity of gasoline-range hydrocarbons (98.0 %). The pyrolysis processes yielded ethylene as the main gas product. With the addition of HZSM-5, propylene and propane were the primary gas components. The plausible pathway for the conversion of LLDPE mainly proceeded through radical mechanism for pyrolysis and carbenium ion mechanism for catalysis was elaborated. The potential net energy gain increased from 34.16 MJ/kg to 48.91 MJ/kg with growing feeding rate from 6 g/min to 30 g/min.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of waste plastic LLDPE with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition, and reactor conditions."
"Microwave-assisted fluidized bed reactor pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic for pyrolysis gas production towards a sustainable development Conversion of plastic wastes into value added fuels is a good way for sustainable development. In this study, microwave-assisted fluidized bed reactor pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic for pyrolysis gas production was experimentally investigated, and the effects of pyrolysis temperature (700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100 °C), fluidizing velocity (1.18, 2.36, 3.54, 4.72 and 5.90 × 10-3 m/s) and microwave power (600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 W) on the pyrolysis gas products were analyzed. The results showed that when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 °C to 900 °C, the pyrolysis gas yield was increased from 65.2 wt% to 76.1 wt%, and then decreased to 60.7 wt% at 1100 °C. The pyrolysis gas yield was increased from 60.2 wt% to 76.1 wt% and then decreased to 42.0 wt% as the fluidizing velocity increased from 1.18 × 10-3 m/s to 5.90 × 10-3 m/s. The pyrolysis gas yield was increased from 52.2 wt% to 76.1 wt% and then decreased to 68.9 wt% as the microwave power increased from 600 W to 1000 W. An optimal pyrolysis gas yield of 76.1 wt% was obtained when the pyrolysis temperature was 900 °C, fluidizing velocity was 2.36 × 10-3 m/s and microwave power was 800 W, and the pyrolysis gas was rich in C3H6 (68.6 wt%), CH4 (15.5 wt%), and C3H8 (7.1 wt%) with a higher heating value of 51.8 MJ/m3.

"Transformation of biomass and waste plastic mixtures into hydrocarbon oils and gases by pyrolysis using different reactor temperatures and pressures In this work the laboratory scale pyrolysis and gasification of biomass and plastic waste mixtures were investigated at different temperatures (450°C and 750°C) and reactor pressures (0.1 bar and 1.0 bar). The main decomposition reactions and the effect of the process parameters were followed through the product yields and compositions of gases and pyrolysis oils. Less residue and significantly more gases had been found at higher temperature, which phenomena was more notable in case of higher proportion of plastic waste in the raw material mixtures. The concentration of hydrogen in gases changed by opposite trend at 450°C and 750°C as function of biomass ratios. The hydrogen and CO ratio can also increase by the increasing in plastic proportion of raw materials at both temperatures and pressures. Regarding the pressure, it can increase the pyrolysis and gasification reactions resulted higher yields of gases and lower oil/water ratios. More hydrogen and less C2-C6 compounds were found using 0.1 bar reactor pressure. Pyrolysis-oil contained aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; n-paraffin, n-olefin, aldehyde, ketones, alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, etc. Due to deoxygenation reactions, hydrocarbons with less oxygen-containing compounds were found at 0.1 bar pressure.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic mixtures with measurable product yields, temperature–pressure effects, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Insights into the char-production mechanism during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes Co-pyrolysis is a promising method for converting biomass/plastic wastes into high-value-added carbon materials. The mechanism involved in co-pyrolysis process for char production is complex and the relevant information is limited, making it essential to investigate the evolution mechanism. In response, different co-pyrolysis methods (blending with multiple interaction, volatile-volatile interaction, volatile-char interaction) were adopted for bamboo and polyethylene (PE). The char-production mechanism was investigated based on physicochemical properties and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis of char. The addition of PE significantly affected the char properties compared to bamboo pyrolysis. The yield of char increased from 24.80 % to 26.59 % and the specific surface area decreased from 103.64 m2 g−1 to 1.84 m2 g−1. The High H/C ratio, low O/C ratio, low porosity, and high oxidation reactivity of co-pyrolysis char is attribute to hydrodeoxygenation reactions on char surface and the deposition of amorphous carbon on the bamboo char. Experiments with different co-pyrolysis methods revealed a significant synergistic effect between bamboo char and volatiles from PE, with the latter depositing on the former's surface as amorphous carbon. The interaction between bamboo char and volatiles from PE during co-pyrolysis was revealed by in-situ DRIFT analysis, further elucidating the evolution mechanism. A series of hydrodeoxygenation reactions and radical transfer reactions were induced to occur. It is of great significance to further study the mechanism of co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) and bamboo, with measurable product yields, char properties, and in-situ spectroscopic analysis of char formation mechanisms."
"Production of benzene/toluene/ethyl benzene/xylene (BTEX) via multiphase catalytic pyrolysis of hazardous waste polyethylene using low cost fly ash synthesized natural catalyst The valuable aromatics benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) were effectively produced from waste polyethylene (PE) using fly ash synthesized catalyst. The BTEX yield was enhanced significantly using multiphase catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene. Low cost natural catalyst was synthesized from fly ash (FA) in 5 different synthesized form i.e., fly ash in natural form (FAN), fly ash calcined at 600 °C (FA-600), 700 °C (FA-700), 800 °C (FA-800) and 900 °C (FA-900). The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis both were conducted in a specially designed semi-batch reactor at the temperature range of 500–800 °C. Catalytic pyrolysis were performed in two different phases within the reactor batch by batch systematically, keeping the catalyst in a liquid phase (A-Type) and liquid and vapor phase/multiphase (B-Type), respectively. The maximum liquid yield of 78.20 wt% was obtained at a temperature of 700 °C using FA-800 catalyst in A-type arrangement. Total aromatics (BTEX) of 10.92 wt% was obtained for thermal pyrolysis at a temperature of 700 °C. In contrary, the aromatic (BTEX) contents were significantly increased for the catalytic pyrolysis in both reactor arrangement A and B types, nearly doubled from 10.92 wt% (thermal pyrolysis) to 21.34 wt% for A-type and 22.12 wt% for B type/multiphase. The pyrolysis oil was characterized using GC-FID, carbon residue test and other fuel testing methods to evaluate the suitability of its end use and aromatic content.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polyethylene using synthesized fly ash catalysts, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis oil."
"Thermal investigation of plastic solid waste pyrolysis via the deconvolution technique using the asymmetric double sigmoidal function: Determination of the kinetic triplet, thermodynamic parameters, thermal lifetime and pyrolytic oil composition for clean energy recovery Pyrolysis is widely used as a waste treatment technology (thermal recycling), which can be an alternative to disposal in landfills. To investigate the applicability of pyrolysis of plastic solid waste (PSW) to recovery energy from plastic solid waste (PSW), the pyrolysis of PSW was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer under an inert condition. The PSW samples were heated under dynamic conditions from 25 °C to 1000 °C at four low heating rates (5, 10, 20, and 30 °C min−1). The decomposition behavior of pseudo-components was characterized by the deconvolution method using the asymmetric double sigmoidal function (Asym2Sig), and the data obtained were used to determine the kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters were evaluated by isoconversional methods, the compensation effect factor and master plot. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH and ΔS) and lifetime were estimated based on the thermogravimetric and kinetic data. In addition, a fixed-bed reactor and GC–MS were employed to identify some valuable products in pyrolytic oil. Three pseudo-components were identified, which had the main influence on pyrolytic performance. The kinetic parameters suggested the suitability of PSW pyrolysis, where the reaction models were found to be suitable for describing the thermal behavior of PSW pyrolysis. The simulation profile curves from the simplified kinetic expression based on the kinetic triplet and deconvolution results had a satisfactory agreement with experimental conversion curves. The thermodynamic parameters were consistent with other wastes used as a bioenergy feedstock. Plastic solid waste presents attractive characteristics for pyrolytic oil production. The main highlights achieved for this study indicate that the pyrolysis of plastic solid waste can be an important step for the development of a recycling system that can recover energy from these wastes in a clean and environmentally friendly process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic solid waste using thermogravimetric analysis and a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and GC–MS analysis of pyrolytic oil composition."
"Thermal behaviour of binary and ternary copolymers containing acrylonitrile Three types of acrylonitrile copolymers (acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer (ABS 1 1 Acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer. ), acrylonitrile-styrene random copolymer (SAN 2 2 Acrylonitrile-styrene random copolymer. ) and acrylonitrile-butadiene random copolymer (BAN 3 3 Acrylonitrile-butadiene random copolymer. ) were studied by thermogravimetry (TG/DTG 4 4 Thermogravimetry. ) and by pyrolysis in a semi-batch process at 450 °C in order to find structure–thermal behaviour relationships. The overlapped thermo-oxidative degradation processes were separated and the corresponding kinetic parameters were calculated. The TG/DTG studies have evidenced that the styrene-acrylonitrile interactions stabilize the nitrile groups reacting by chain scission rather than cyclization and destabilize the styrene units. Also, the cyclization of the acrylonitrile units in ABS is favoured by interactions with the styrene and butadiene units. The pyrolysis behaviour evidenced that the styrene-acrylonitrile interactions in SAN and ABS lead to the formation of 4-phenylbutyronitrile as the most important decomposition compound. ABS shows similar composition of the degradation oil with SAN copolymer therefore in the ABS the styrene-butadiene interactions are less important than those between styrene and acrylonitrile units.","The study involves pyrolysis of commercial plastic copolymers (ABS, SAN, BAN) in a semi-batch reactor at 450 °C with measurable product composition analysis and yield relationships."
"Conversion of low density polyethylene into petrochemical feedstocks using a continuous screw kiln reactor Thermal and catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using a screw kiln reactor provided with two zones of reaction temperature. Thermal degradation experiments carried out at different temperatures and screw speeds have shown that this continuous system is suitable for the LDPE degradation, product outputs up to c.a. 100 g/h being obtained. Compared to a conventional batch reactor, the screw kiln system leads to a lower formation of gaseous products, whereas overcracking of the heavy fractions is also reduced. These differences are probably originated by the intimate contact and the same residence times for all the product fractions that exist within the screw reactor, which is in contrast with the selective and fast withdrawal of volatile products taking place in the batch system. In the catalytic experiments, a mesoporous MCM-41 type aluminosilicate has been used as catalyst, being continuously fed to the screw reactor mixed with the raw plastic material. In these conditions, yields up to 80% towards hydrocarbons within the gasoline range (C5C12) have been obtained. Moreover, high amounts of C7 and C8 hydrocarbons are present in the gasoline fractions, which is assigned to catalytic oligomerization reactions that selectively affect to C3 and C4 gaseous hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a continuous screw kiln reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
Catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene to synthesize carbon nanotubes and hydrogen through a two-stage process A two-stage reaction process was used to convert polypropylene (PP) into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and hydrogen-rich gas. The proposed process consisted of two stages: catalytic pyrolysis of PP over HZSM-5 zeolite in a screw kiln reactor and the subsequent catalytic decomposition of pyrolysis gases over a nickel catalysts in a moving-bed reactor for producing MWCNTs and hydrogen. The resultant gas mainly consisted of hydrogen and methane. SEM and TEM images revealed that carbon products in the moving-bed reactor were in the form of MWCNTs. XRD and TGA characterization indicated that high decomposition temperature resulted in the formation of more highly crystalline nanotubes. The influence of pyrolysis temperature (550–750 °C) and decomposition temperature (500–800 °C) on the performances of the two-stage reaction system were investigated. The MWCNT yield and hydrogen concentration increased with an increase in the decomposition temperature and reached a maximum at 700 °C. With increasing pyrolysis temperature the yield of pyrolysis gas increased while the liquid yield decreased. The yield of MWCNTs in the moving-bed reactor was determined by both the quantity and quality of the pyrolysis gas.,"The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (a commercial plastic) with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Investigating use of metal-modified HZSM-5 catalyst to upgrade liquid yield in co-pyrolysis of wheat straw and polystyrene Co-pyrolysis of wheat straw (WS) and polystyrene (PS) at a weight ratio of 1:1 was conducted in a fixed bed reactor. The effect of ex-situ application of HZSM-5 and its metal modified versions (MZSM-5s) on organic liquid product (OP) upgradation was explored. MZSM-5s were synthesized by adding metal (Co, Ni, Zn, and Fe) oxides to parent HZSM-5 catalyst through wet impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, and N2 physisorption. In the first phase, the effect of co-pyrolysis temperature (500–650 °C) on product distribution was evaluated. The liquid yield varied in the range of 49–55 wt%, with a maximum at 550 °C. In the second phase, results obtained from vapor catalyzed co-pyrolysis conducted at 550 °C showed that impregnation of HZSM-5 with metals resulted in relatively higher OP oil yield as compared to parent HZSM-5. Co-ZSM-5 produced maximum OP yield (39.0%) followed by Zn-ZSM-5 (38.2%), Fe-ZSM-5 (37.7%) and Ni-ZSM-5 (36.1%). Whilst, the coke yield was reduced for all MZSM-5s by approximately 50%. Moreover, the addition of metals significantly favored the catalytic selectivity towards monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). Fe-ZSM-5 proved to be most the effective catalyst exhibiting the highest de-oxygenation potential (97.4%) and displaying maximum MAHs content (83.3%). Simultaneously, MZSM-5s reduced undesirable polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yield noticeably.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) and wheat straw, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene for aviation oil production The recycling and reuse of plastics is getting more and more attention all over the world as there are increasing environmental and energy problems. In this study, aviation oil production from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene plastics was detailed. The yields and components of oils at different microwave absorbent loads (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 g SiC), microwave powers (450, 550, 650, 750, and 850 W), and pyrolysis temperatures (340, 400, 460, 520, and 580 °C) were elaborated for the target of aviation oil production. The results showed that the oil yield improved initially and then declined within the range of 56.00–98.78 wt% when there were increases in the microwave absorbent load, microwave power, or pyrolysis temperature. The highest oil yield (98.78 wt%) in the world was obtained at SiC load of 60 g, microwave power of 650 W, and pyrolysis temperature of 460 °C. The main components of the oils contained monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloalkenes with C8-C16 as the majority (64.794–85.932 area%).

"Effect of catalyst properties on the cracking of polypropylene pyrolysis waxes under FCC conditions The catalytic cracking of polyolefin pyrolysis waxes has been studied under conditions that mimic the operation of a catalytic cracking unit (FCC). Two commercial catalysts of different properties were used. Yields and compositions of the lumps (dry gases, LPG, gasoline and coke) were compared with those corresponding to the actual feed in the refinery (vacuum gas-oil). The effect of process operating conditions (temperature and contact time) is significant. Catalyst acidity has a significant effect on conversion (at a temperature around 525°C) and on yields and compositions of lumps (in the 500–550°C range). The main effect of increasing catalyst acidity is an increase in coke content on the catalyst by decreasing the yield to dry gases. Due to the higher hydrogen transfer capacity, the gasoline obtained using the catalyst with higher acidity has a higher aromatic (especially C6–C8) and paraffinic content, and lower olefin content, being these two latter fractions less branched. An increase in catalyst acidity leads to a lower yield of light olefins and to an increase in the yield of paraffins.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene pyrolysis waxes under FCC conditions with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Optimization of influencing factors during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics with focus on monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content The thermal conversion of organic solid waste is a relatively economical and feasible method to obtain monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. In order to clarify the effect of different temperature, blend ratio and reaction time on the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics, and to seek the best experimental conditions, maize stalk and polystyrene plastic were used as raw materials to analyze the content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). At the same time, based on the Response Surface Methodology of Central Composite Design, a quadratic regression equation for the co-pyrolysis of maize stalk and polystyrene with focus on content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was established through the response surface optimization experiment of three factors and three levels. Variance analysis showed that the regression model was significant. The order of influencing factors from high to low on monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content was temperature, blend ratio of maize stalk to polystyrene, and reaction time. The optimal experimental conditions were temperature 600 ℃, blend ratio 1:3, reaction time 10.246 s, and the simulated content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was 68.99%. Based on actual situation, the optimum experimental conditions were temperature 600 ℃, blend ratio 1:3, reaction time 10 s, the theoretical and experimental content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were 68.31% and 65.68%, respectively.

Considering this full value chain, this study provides the first unbiased and up-to-date benchmark of polypropylene and polystyrene pyrolysis oils (PPO and PSO) produced in an industrial-grade batch reactor. The pyrolysis process was optimized to achieve ultra-high liquid yield levels of 92% for PPO and 98% for PSO with minimum energy consumption. After post-processing, blending with diesel, and normative fuel analytics, combustion/emission tests involving 20 species preceded under fully controllable conditions using a state-of-the-art single-cylinder research engine. The fuel analysis results revealed significant disparities between the properties of PPO and PSO. PPO exhibited a diverse carbon structure, resulting in very low density and high volatility. On the other hand, PSO was predominantly composed of aromatics, leading to low viscosity and poor auto-ignition properties. Engine tests showed that PPO blends exhibited combustion characteristics similar to diesel, while PSO blends exhibited significant differences, particularly during the premixed combustion stage attributed to pilot injection. Following the combustion response, the addition of PPO had minimal impact on emissions, while PSO acted as an emission enhancer, resulting in over twofold increase in particulate matter at high loads. Consequently, PSO showed elevated carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions due to the higher contribution of aromatics. Ultimately, this study challenges the prevailing perception of plastic-derived fuels as “dirty”. By implementing feedstock segregation to minimize polystyrene content, it is possible to achieve a fossil substitute level of 40% while meeting all emission and safety regulations for diesel engines with a minimum economic burden.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and polystyrene in a batch reactor, with measured yields, product characterization, and engine performance data."
"Conversion of char from pyrolysis of plastic wastes into alternative activated carbons for heavy metal removal The valorization of post-consumer mixed plastics in pyrolysis processes represents an abundant reservoir of carbon that can be effectively converted into useful chars. This process not only holds appeal in terms of improving plastic waste concerns but also contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, thus aligning with the principles of a circular economy paradigm. In this study, the char produced from the pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed plastic waste has been activated with Na2CO3, KOH, NaOH, and K2CO3 to improve the textural, structural, and composition characteristics, leading to improved adsorption capability. These characteristics were studied by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscopy, elemental and immediate analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The developed surface area (SBET) was 573, 939, 704 and 592 m2 g−1 for Na2CO3, KOH, NaOH and K2CO3 activated carbons, respectively. These activated chars (ACs) were tested for the adsorption of heavy metals in both synthetic waters containing Pb, Cd, and Cu and industrial wastewater collected at an agrochemical production plant. Na2CO3-AC was the best performing material. The metal uptake in synthetic waters using a batch set-up was 40, 13 and 12 mg g−1 for Pb, Cd and Cu. Experiments in a column set-up using Na2CO3-AC resulted in a saturation time of 290, 16, and 80 min for Pb, Cd, and Cu synthetic waters, respectively, and metal uptakes of 26.8, 4.1, and 7.9 mg g−1, respectively. The agrochemical effluents, containing mainly Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn were tested in a plug-flow column. The metal uptake notably decreased compared to synthetic water due to a competition effect for active sites.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of the resulting char and activated carbons."
"A process study on the pyrolysis of waste polyethylene The thermo-catalytic cracking of waste polyethylene bottles was thoroughly examined to determine the possibility of operating the process in continuous mode. Two types of zeolite catalysts renowned for their strong catalytic properties and precise selectivity, HUSY and HBeta, were used to study the slates and yields of the products generated under various operating conditions. The liquid and gas samples were analyzed via GC–MS to determine the hydrocarbons chain distribution in terms of paraffins, olefins and aromatics. Under thermal heating, the gas yield reached 17.8% in the absence of catalysts and it increased to 93–96% when HUSY and HBeta were used in vapor contact mode. This yield dropped to 57% when energy-efficient induction heating was applied. Under hydrogen cracking, the gas yield decreased further to 51.6% while the P/O ratio increased due to a rise in the C13–C23+ paraffin contents. The catalyst deactivation stage showed that both HUSY and HBeta started to lose their activity as waste HDPE charges were continuously fed to the reactor. After the third HDPE charge, the amount of solid and liquid wax products dramatically increased and the process started to resemble to thermal pyrolysis. High gas yields of greater than 90% were achieved when the catalysts were regenerated with industrial air at 550°C, indicating full catalyst recovery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyethylene using catalysts, with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and reactor condition data."
"An investigation into the catalytic cracking of LDPE using Py–GC/MS Pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection (Py–GC/MS) has been used to study the catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). This novel approach allowed rapid screening of the catalytic activity of different acid solids and permitted a straightforward analysis of the resulting products. The results obtained are comparable to those reported by other authors while very small sample and catalysts masses (less than 0.2mg) were required. For the purpose of this work, three acid solids differing in their textural and acid properties (micrometer HZSM-5, nanocrystaline n-HZSM-5 and Al-MCM-41) were synthesized, characterised for their chemical and structural characteristics and tested for their thermal stability between 550 and 800°C. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was then employed to evaluate their catalytic activity in the degradation of pure LDPE. This activity was related to their capacity to shift the degradation reaction to lower temperatures. Py–GC/MS analysis of pure LDPE at 700°C generated a pyrogram with characteristic triplets corresponding to straight chain diene, alkene and alkane hydrocarbons of varying lengths. Catalytic degradation of LDPE over micrometer and nanocystalline HZSM-5 zeolites generated a similar range of degradation products with a marked increase in the light olefins and aromatic fractions (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene) and complete elimination of heavier olefin and paraffin hydrocarbons. Despite its high catalytic activity, as determined by TG analysis, mesoporous Al-MCM-41 exhibited no shape selectivity in the products generated with a low proportion of aromatics and a higher content of olefin and paraffin species.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE using fixed-bed reactor conditions, with measurable product yields and composition analysis via Py–GC/MS, TG, and catalyst characterization."
"Study on the co-pyrolysis interactions and chlorine migration behaviors of polyvinyl chloride and Hami coal Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and low-rank coal is an effective way to realize resource recycling, while the chlorides released during the co-pyrolysis process would corrode the equipment and affect the product quality. Therefore, the synergistic effect and chlorine migration behavior of co-pyrolysis for Hami (HM) coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied through in situ pyrolysis time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-TOF-MS) and fix-bed experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC polymer (PVC-PO)/PVC pipes (PVC-P) and HM coal exhibits different synergistic effects on the co-pyrolysis products. The results of Py-TOF-MS suggested that co-pyrolysis promotes the reactions between small molecular fragments and the secondary reactions between volatiles, which accelerates the generation of MAHs and PAHs. However, the addition of HM coal inhibits the generation of polyene fragments and aromatics. These two effects are competitive for the aromatization reactions. Moreover, the additives in PVC-P improve the tar quality and lead to more than 0.86–1.82 % of the chlorine being fixed in co-pyrolysis char. Co-pyrolysis inhibits the release of HCl and results in a migration of chlorine from the gas phase to the solid/liquid phase. 7:3 is a suitable mixing ratio to fix chlorine, which provides guidance for the targeted regulation of chlorine.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed experiments on the co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) and low-rank coal, with measurable product yields, chlorine migration behavior, and analytical characterization of volatiles and char."
"Fuel oil from ABS using a tandem PEG-enhanced denitrogenation–pyrolysis method: Thermal degradation of denitrogenated ABS Thermal degradation of ABS and denitrogenated ABS samples (DABS), prepared by sequential hydrolysis of ABS using PEG/NaOH, has been investigated under inert gas and at atmospheric pressure in a temperature range between 40 and 700°C, by means of TGA, TGA-IR, and TGA-MS, to study the link between original structure of DABS and eventual pyrolysis. For DABS, thermal decomposition begins at the side groups of –CONH2 and/or –COOH, resulting in a lower initial degradation temperature of DABS (around 330°C) relative to ABS (372.5°C). Moreover, less HCN and acrylonitrile evolve from the DABS samples, while the evolution of CO2 starts earlier and becomes more important, in line with the decreased number of –CN groups and the increased number of –COOH functional groups due to hydrolysis. The results from thermo-analytical experiments were confirmed by batch pyrolysis tests: the nitrogen content of oil produced from DABS pyrolysis is much lower, compared with that from ABS, proving that effective denitrogenation of ABS prior to pyrolysis is beneficial to the quality of pyrolysis oil.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste ABS plastic, with measurable product yields and compositional analysis showing reduced nitrogen content in the pyrolysis oil from denitrogenated ABS."
"Aromatization of HDPE and PP over Ga-promoted zeolite: Effects of pretreatment and zeolite type The effects of pretreatment and structure of zeolite on aromatization of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) over different Ga-promoted zeolites (HZSM-5, hierarchical HZSM-5, HY, Hβ, and USY) were investigated. Hydrogen reduction of Ga-promoted HZSM-5 resulted in a higher yield of alkenes during HDPE pyrolysis but did not lead to increased production of total aromatic hydrocarbons. The reduction and subsequent oxidation of Ga/Z5 led to the formation of GaO+ species with high dehydrogenation activity. This resulted in a remarkable 65% yield of aromatics, with a BTEX (benzene, toluene ethylbenzene and xylene) overall yield of 60% and a selectivity of 90% of the liquid product. Increasing the Ga loading decreased the BTEX yield due to pore blockage and a decrease in the amount of Brønsted acid sites. The BTEX yield over Ga-promoted zeolites was found to be strongly related to the pore size of the zeolite, whereas its yield over the parent zeolite was not strongly dependent on the pore size. Diffusion of the cracking intermediates was found to have a more significant impact on the aromatization of PP than HDPE. The highest BTEX yield for HDPE was achieved with Ga-promoted HZSM-5, while Ga-promoted hierarchical HZSM-5 exhibited the highest BTEX yield for PP. Furthermore, Ga(1)/Hβ-Redox demonstrated remarkable selectivity (90%) towards ethylene and propylene in the gas phase, surpassing other zeolites (37%-68%).","The study investigates catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE and PP using Ga-promoted zeolites, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis studies of PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br plastics mixed with PET and dehalogenation (Br, Cl) of the liquid products Pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP)/polyethylene (PE)/polystyrene (PS)/poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)/high impact polystyrene with brominated flame retardant (HIPS-Br) plastics mixed with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was performed at 430°C under atmospheric pressure using a semi-batch operation. The presence of PET in the pyrolysis mixture of PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br affected significantly the formation of decomposition products and the decomposition behavior of the plastic mixture. We observed the following effects of PET on the pyrolysis of PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br mixed plastics: (i) the yield of liquid product decreased and the formation of gaseous products increased; (ii) a waxy residue was formed in addition to the solid carbon residue; (iii) the formation of SbBr3 was not detected in liquid products; (iv) the yield of chlorinated branched alkanes increased as well as vinyl bromide and ethyl bromide were formed. The use of calcium carbonate carbon composite (Ca-C) completely removed the chlorine and bromine content from the liquid products during PP/PE/PS/PVC/HIPS-Br pyrolysis, however in the presence of PET, the catalytic experiment (Ca-C, 8g) yielded liquid products containing 310ppm of Br and 20ppm of Cl. In addition, the Ca-C increased the yield of liquid products about 3–6wt.%, as well as enhanced the gaseous product evolution and decreased the yield of residue. The halogen free liquid hydrocarbons can be used as a feedstock in a refinery or as a fuel.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PP, PE, PS, PVC, HIPS-Br, PET) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste: Chlorine distribution and formation of organic chlorinated compounds The release of chlorine during the pyrolysis of actual municipal plastic waste (MPW) was studied. Firstly, thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) was analyzed to investigate the chlorine release behavior. Then, the effect of temperature on chlorine migrations was investigated by fast pyrolysis experiments in a fixed bed reactor. Results showed that chlorine released mainly between 241 and 353 °C in the form of HCl or chloroesters during MPW pyrolysis. After pyrolysis, chlorine was mainly distributed in the pyrolytic gas (74.34–82.89 %) and char (10.17–21.29 %). However, the release of chlorine was inhibited due to the melting behavior of MPW at <350 °C. Besides, the relative contents and types of organic chlorinated compounds in liquid products were both decreased with temperature. It was observed that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the greatest contributor to the formation of organic chlorinated compounds during MPW pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the pyrolysis of PET was significantly promoted by the HCl released from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Subsequently, the pathways for the formation of organic chlorinated compounds through the co-pyrolysis of PVC and PET were proposed, including the initial degradation and subsequent chlorination of PET. These findings provided new insights into the release and regulation of chlorine-containing pollutants during actual MPW pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of chlorine distribution and organic chlorinated compounds."
"Thermal degradation of mixed plastic waste to aromatics and gas A poly(vinylchloride) (PVC)-poor light fraction separated from mixed plastic waste (MPW) collected from German households by DSD was pyrolyzed in a technical scale fluidized bed reactor to yield aromatic oils and heat-providing gas. The most important target products were benzene, toluene, xylenes and styrene with a total yield of 31.4% by weight (referring to the total organic input). Additionally, pyrolysis gas with a high calorific value of 50 MJ/kg was obtained. Problematic pollutants, such as chloro-organic compounds and heavy metals, were absent or immobilized during the pyrolysis reaction in a matrix of carbon black.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste in a fluidized bed reactor, with measurable yields of aromatics and gas, and analytical characterization of products."
"Pyrolysis and combustion of community masks: Thermogravimetric analyses, characterizations, gaseous emissions, and kinetic modeling Used community masks are often thrown away or scattered in the environment. In addition to the unsightly aspect of such waste, these masks are a diffuse source of pollution because of some of their synthetic components: polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide 6, polyamide 66, and elastane. These diffuse sources of pollution must be processed in an appropriate way, once they are collected. Among such processes, pyrolysis or combustion are to be explored. In the present study, five different masks were characterized before being submitted to pyrolysis and combustion experiments performed in a thermobalance under temperature ramps of 5, 10, 15, or 20 °C/min. Kinetic modeling of these pyrolysis or combustion processes was performed using the EIPR model because each mask contains different layers or components. The optimal values of the kinetic parameters were compared for the five masks and compared with that of their components. In complement to the thermogravimetric experiments, the main gaseous emissions (CO, CO2, THC, NO and NO2) were continuously measured during combustion tests in a horizontal oven. The gaseous emissions and mass rates curves were compared for each mask.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic masks composed of polypropylene, PET, and other commercial plastics, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization."
"Red-mud based porous nanocatalysts for valorisation of municipal solid waste Red mud samples were used to catalyse in-situ co-pyrolysis of pinewood and low-density polyethylene for the production of high-quality bio-oil. The sodium cation in the crude red-mud was exchanged with barium and calcium cations and further tested to explore their role in oil upgrading. The relationship between red-mud catalytic activity and its constituents was explored using synthetic sodalite. The red-mud catalysts exhibited a considerable aromatisation capacity compared to the thermal co-pyrolysis, as the selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 12.7 to 19.6%, respectively. Long-chain molecules cracking was more significant in synthetic sodalite associated with their acidic active sites. The addition of barium and calcium cations to the red-mud largely improved oxygen elimination as a result of the enhanced catalyst basicity. In contrast, the aromatisation ability of red-mud significantly impeded by the large cation size (Ba2+ and Ca2+) due to the limited diffusion of pyrolysis vapours to the active sites. Ba-exchanged red-mud catalysts reduced the content of carboxylic acids in the bio-oil to 1.8 % while maintained a high yield of the organic fraction (34 %). Ca-exchanged red-mud catalysts produced the lowest fraction of oxygenated compounds (35.1 %); however, the organic phase yield was as low as 23.6 %. The modified red-mud catalysts reduced the fraction of oxygenated compounds from 69.9–35.1% during the biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and pinewood with characterized catalysts, reporting measurable product yields, oxygenated compound reduction, and catalytic performance data."
"Study on the pyrolysis behaviors of mixed waste plastics Pyrolysis is considered as a promising technology to recover valuable hydrocarbons from waste streams. Even though some studies exist on waste plastics pyrolysis, it still lacks of in-depth knowledge on multiple components plastics pyrolysis. This study explores three types of waste plastics and their mixed forms to obtain thermal cracking features, products distribution, and kinetic features. TG-FTIR was used to observe the decomposition characteristics and functional groups in the volatile fractions of products. The interaction effects of the plastics components during the co-pyrolysis process were compared, analyzed, and reported. For a more precise knowledge of the reaction procedure, a thermodynamic study was conducted. Results showed that TG and DTG curves of PS and PE were similar to each other but different from those of PVC. The main products of PE and PS pyrolysis were alkanes and alkenes, while the major products of PVC pyrolysis were HCl, alkenes, and a small number of aromatic compounds. During the co-pyrolysis process of PS with PVC and PE with PVC, the thermal decomposition rates of PVC were accelerated due to synergistic effect. Implied by the kinetic parameters, pyrolysis of PS, PE, and PVC exhibited one-order reaction from pure component to multiple component mixtures.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PS, PVC) with measurable product distribution, thermal decomposition characteristics, and kinetic analysis using TG-FTIR and thermodynamic study."
"Formation of chloride products in the MSW (municipal solid wastes) pyrolysis process by Py-GC/MS method with key model components The formation of chloride products in the process for pyrolysis of municipal solid wastes (MSW) with key model components was investigated by Py-GC/MS method. HCl and CH3Cl are identified as the most abundant chloride products for the individual pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or corn straw (CS) in the range of 200–600 °C. For the pyrolysis of CS, a higher temperature is more favorable for the generation of HCl than that of CH3Cl. In the PVC pyrolytic products, chlorobenzene (Ph-Cl), benzyl chloride (Ph-CH2Cl), and 1-(chloroethyl)benzene (Ph-CHClCH3) are also detected but in extremely low amounts. For the co-pyrolysis of PVC/CS, the formation of CH3Cl is significantly promoted. The synergistic effect in the PVC/CS co-pyrolysis process is mainly attributed to the reaction between the HCl derived from PVC and the decomposition products of lignin. The products of Ph-Cl and Ph-CH2Cl are mainly generated from the cyclization of Cl-containing chain species. CH3Cl and Ph-CHClCH3 are mainly generated from secondary reactions between HCl and other pyrolytic products. No remarkable synergistic effect is observed on the formations of chlorides in the co-pyrolysis of PVC/PP (polypropylene), while the generation of Ph-CHClCH3 is significantly enhanced in the co-pyrolysis of PVC/PS (polystyrene).","The study investigates the pyrolysis of waste plastics, specifically PVC, in municipal solid waste and its co-pyrolysis with other materials, using experimental methods and reporting measurable product yields and compositions."
"Investigating the possibility of using waste plastic fuel and gasoline fuel mixture in gasoline direct injection engine through experimental studies and the Taguchi method This study explores the use of waste plastic oil (WPO) as a potential substitute for gasoline in gasoline direct injection (GDi) spark-ignition (SI) engines. WPO was blended with gasoline in various ratios to assess its feasibility for reducing crude oil dependency and addressing global plastic waste management challenges. The WPO was extracted using a thermal-catalytic pyrolysis process in a batch reactor, utilizing a novel catalyst and discarded plastic chairs (comprising polycarbonate and high/low-density polyethylene) sourced from the university. The chemical and physical properties of the WPO were analyzed and compared with gasoline to evaluate its compatibility as a blend component, supported by GC–MS and FTIR analyses. Experimental tests were conducted on a GDi-based SI engine with WPO/gasoline blends at different engine speeds (2000, 2500, and 3000 rpm) and load conditions (low, partial, and high). Key parameters such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), and Cylinder Pressure (CP) were measured, with fixed spark timing at 18° bTDC and injection pressure at 180 bars. The experimental design employed the Taguchi method (L18 orthogonal array) with input variables including WPO/gasoline blend ratio, engine load, and engine speed, aiming to optimize output responses such as BTE, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke, and carbon monoxide (CO). Results showed that the B05 blend (5% WPO) achieved approximately 3–5 % higher BTE than gasoline under all load conditions. Slight increases in EGT were observed for all blends, and delayed cylinder peak pressure trends were noted compared to gasoline at part load conditions. Optimization analysis identified the B05 blend, a load of 7 Nm, and an engine speed of 2000 rpm as the optimal conditions. A significant performance improvement was also observed for the B20 blend. Individual response optimizations using contour and surface plots revealed the critical influence of load and blend ratio on engine performance and emissions.","The study involves lab-scale thermal-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic chairs (polycarbonate and polyethylene) in a batch reactor, with measurable product yields, GC–MS and FTIR analysis, and engine performance data from experimental tests."
"Converting polycarbonate and polystyrene plastic wastes intoaromatic hydrocarbons via catalytic fast co-pyrolysis Thermochemical conversion of plastic wastes is a promising approach to produce alternative energy-based fuels. Herein, we conducted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of polycarbonate (PC) and polystyrene (PS) to generate aromatic hydrocarbons using HZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil-5, hydrogen, Aluminosilicate) as a catalyst. The results indicated that employing HZSM-5 in the catalytic conversion of PC facilitated the synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons in comparison to the non-catalytic run. A competitive reaction between aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic oxygenates was observed within the studied temperature region, and catalytic degradation temperature of 700 °C maximized the competing reaction towards the formation of targeted aromatic hydrocarbons at the expense of phenolic products. Catalyst type also played a vital role in the catalytic decomposition of PC wastes, and HZSM-5 with different Si/Al molar ratios produced more aromatic hydrocarbons than HY (Zeolite Y, hydrogen, Faujasite). Regarding the effect of Si/Al molar ration in HZSM-5 on the distribution of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), a Si/Al molar ratio of 38 maximized benzene formation with an advanced factor of 5.1. Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of PC with hydrogen-rich plastic wastes including polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polystyrene (PS) favored the production of MAHs, and PS was the most effective hydrogen donor with a ∼2.5-fold increase. The additive effect of MAHs increased at first and then decreased when the PC percentage was elevated from 30 % to 90 %, achieving the maximum value of 32.4 % at 70 % PC.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of waste polycarbonate and polystyrene plastics with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste corn stover and high-density polyethylene for hydrocarbon production: The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 zeolite In this work, acid-washing corn stover (ACS) impregnated with various concentrations of potassium was co-pyrolyzed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fixed bed reactor. The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 zeolite on product yields and mono-aromatic selectivity was studied. As the concentration of potassium increased, a reduction in liquid and an increase in gas and char yields were observed in both catalytic and non-catalytic co-pyrolysis. Potassium enhanced alkenes production with a maximum value of 54.2 % obtained from 0.8 wt%K-ACS/HDPE, indicating that potassium dispersed in char exerted catalytic effect on promoting the degradation of HDPE. Compared to ACS/HDPE, the catalytic co-pyrolysis of K-ACS/HDPE over HZSM-5 produced higher yield of mono-aromatics in the range of 77.3–82.5 % due to the fact that potassium optimized the co-pyrolysis intermediates diffused into HZSM-5 zeolite. The coupling effect of potassium and HZSM-5 also favored the selectivity of toluene and xylene while suppressed the selectivity of alkylnaphthalene. The ICP-MS result showed that only a trace amount of potassium was deposited on the HZSM-5 zeolite during the ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis process. The BET surface area and acidity of spent HZSM-5 zeolites increased and the coke amount decreased with the potassium concentration, indicating that potassium alleviated the deactivation of HZSM-5 zeolite by changing the yield and distribution of co-pyrolysis intermediates.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste HDPE with corn stover, reports measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Valorization by thermal cracking over silica of polyolefins dissolved in LCO A study has been made of the cracking of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) (which are the main components of post-consumer plastic wastes) dissolved in the Light Cycle Oil (LCO) product stream of a commercial Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit. The cracking has been carried out on a mesoporous silica (pore size between 3 and 30 nm) in the 723–823 K range. This strategy for upgrading plastics and solvents together avoids heat transfer limitations and other problems inherent to the cracking of solid plastics. The polyolefins are transformed mainly into the components that make up the pool of gasoline (C5–C12). Furthermore, the incorporation of polyolefins has a synergistic effect on the cracking of LCO and causes a major decrease in the content of aromatics of the pool of gasoline and an increase in the content of olefins, paraffins and i-paraffins.","The study involves lab-scale thermal cracking of waste polyolefins (PE and PP) in LCO using mesoporous silica, with measurable product yields and compositional analysis of gasoline-range hydrocarbons."
"A multifunctional strategy: Lithium recovery and chlorine fixation via co-pyrolysis of spent lithium-ion batteries and chlorinated waste plastics Both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and chlorinated plastics are playing an extremely important role in our lives and leading to severe environmental issues when they reach end-of-life. In this work, a novel method to synchronously recover lithium from the spent LIBs and fix Cl from chlorinated waste plastics was proposed via co-pyrolysis and water leaching. The Li in the spent NCM LIBs was converted into soluble Li2CO3 and LiCl after the pyrolysis reduction, while Co, Ni, and Mn in the NCM were transformed into insoluble oxide or metal. Meanwhile, the Cl in the chlorinated plastics can be fixed and recovered in the form of LiCl, which avoids the emission of the pollutants containing Cl. Under optimal conditions, the recovery efficiency of Li was 88.55 %, and the fixing ration of Cl in the chlorinated plastics reached 91.27 %. The novel method is quite promising owing to the fact that it can also be extended to treat various chlorinated waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of chlorinated waste plastics and spent lithium-ion batteries, with measurable product yields and recovery efficiencies reported."
"Liquefaction of municipal waste plastics in VGO over acidic and non-acidic catalysts☆ Co-processing of municipal waste plastics (MWP) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) over HZSM-5, DHC-8 (commercial silica–alumina catalyst) and cobalt loaded active carbon catalyst has been comparatively studied. Co-processing experiments were carried out under hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures between 425 and 450°C. The composition, sulphur and chlorine amount of liquid products were determined. The product distribution and the composition of liquids were changed depending upon the temperature and the catalyst type. As expected temperature led to increase in cracking activity of catalysts. DHC-8 and HZSM-5 showed substantially different activities in co-processing due to the difference in their acidity. HZSM-5 gave highest gas yield at all temperatures and highest liquid yield (38.3) at low temperature. Although Co-AC was a neutral catalyst, it showed the cracking activity as well as HZSM-5 and more than DHC-8. No chlorine compound was observed in liquid products. The sulphur amount in liquid products varied with the catalyst type. Although HZSM-5 showed good cracking activity at low temperatures, it gave the liquid product containing highest sulphur amount. By considering both the quantity and quality of liquid fuel obtained from co-processing, it may be concluded that Co-AC gave the best result in the co-processing of the MWP/VGO blend. To observe the effect of metal type loaded on active carbon on catalyst activity, a series of co-processing experiments was also carried out.","The study involves lab-scale co-processing of municipal waste plastics with VGO using catalysts, measuring product yields, composition, and catalyst performance under defined temperatures and conditions."
"High resolution gas chromatographic–mass spectrometric analysis of polyethylene and polypropylene thermal cracking products Low-density polyethylene and polypropylene were thermally decomposed individually in a batch reactor at temperatures up to 450°C as a recycling route from the aspect of the production of petrochemical feedstock. More detailed separation of polyalkenes splitting compounds was achieved using high resolution GC (efficiencies up to 490,000 plates) than before. The GC–MS as well as the dependence of homomorphy factors and isopropyl group increments on the number of carbon atoms of alk-1-enes, alk-2-enes, alka-α,ω-dienes and alkanes were used for identification of separated analytes. Thermal cracking of LDPE products in the range C5–C23 were characterized by quintets of peaks in the chromatogram which were assigned to n-alkanes, alk-1-enes, (E)-alk-2-enes, (Z)-alk-2-enes and alka-α,ω-dienes with average quantitative ratio 1:1.2:0.07:0.05:0.08. In fraction up to n-C8 140 GC peaks were separated and identified, including around 30 acyclic octenes. In contrast to the polyethylene thermal cracking which yields products with straight-chain hydrocarbon structure, polypropylene cracking is characterized by the formation of compounds with branched and high prevailingly unsaturated hydrocarbon structure. The pretention of this analytical problem lies in stereoisomerism and corresponding multicomponentity of branched alkenes, alkadienes and alkanes in a broad range of carbon atoms number as characteristic decomposition products of polypropylene. Partial separation of all four diastereoisomers of 2,4,6,8-tetramethylundec-1-ene, which is the most abundant compound except for 2,4-dimethylhept-1-ene, was obtained. In the liquid fraction up to n-C8 84 peaks including around 40 acyclic octenes were identified. Other 149 GC peaks were analysed in the C9–C25 fraction with quantitative ratio of alkane:alkene:alkadiene equal to 1:17:4.","The study involves lab-scale thermal cracking of waste plastics LDPE and PP, with measurable product yields, detailed GC–MS analysis of hydrocarbon products, and specific temperature conditions."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of keyboard plastic and sawdust toward petrochemical-grade hydrocarbons over niobium-loaded zeolite catalyst This study examines for the first-time the in-situ co-pyrolysis of e-waste plastic, keyboards (KB) and sawdust (SD) in different blending ratios (2/1, 1/1, and 1/2) using a tandem microreactor–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system at 600 ℃. The blend with SD/KB = 2/1 exhibited a positive synergistic effect in the fractionation of the components and production of valuable aromatics, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), with a significant lowering of oxygenates. For the catalytic co-pyrolysis, Hβ(25) exhibited prominent results toward the BTEX production compared to HZSM-5(30) and Hβ(38). Among the metal-loaded (Nb, Zn, and Fe) Hβ(25), the maximum amount of BTEX was determined over Nb/Hβ(25) with catalyst/feedstock = 3/1. The results of the ex-situ micropyrolyzer configuration highlighted the prominent significance of the in-situ mode toward the activation in breaking the KB polymeric structure. Moreover, the lab-scale co-pyrolysis results exhibited a maximum positive synergistic effect (21.54 %) in the quantified yield of BTEX over the Nb/Hβ(25) catalyst. Furthermore, the Nb/Hβ(25) catalyst was also subjected to the three lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis cycles to evaluate its structural stability and durability.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (keyboards) and sawdust, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Study on the deactivation of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil The deactivation mechanism of Ni-based catalyst in the hydrotreating process of waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO) was investigated. The accelerated deactivation experiment of catalyst was performed with model oil containing different impurities, and results indicated that the deactivation of catalyst was related to chlorides, nitrides, and sulfides in WPPO. By changing the concentration of chloride, the interactions between the three impurities were studied. Combined with the characterization results of fresh and spent catalysts, chloride was the direct cause of the deactivation of the catalyst. Chlorine atoms in chlorides were converted into HCl gas in hydrotreating, which reacted with Ni active sites, resulting in the sintering of the average Ni particle size from 52.62 nm to 139.63 nm, and the loss of Ni active components by 3–8 wt%, especially inhibiting the hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalyst. In addition, HCl reacted with NH3 (byproduct of nitride hydrogenation) to generate NH4Cl. The high concentration of HCl in the reaction system increased the crystallization temperature of NH4Cl from 210 °C to 294 °C, which led to the crystallization of ammonium salts in the catalyst bed. NH4Cl crystals adsorbed on the catalyst surface, resulting in a decrease in specific surface area and pore volume, and an increase in the average pore diameter of the catalyst, which was the main reason for the rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Furthermore, based on the deactivation mechanism, several appropriate solutions were proposed.","The study involves lab-scale experimental work on hydrotreating waste plastic pyrolysis oil, with measurable data on catalyst deactivation, impurity effects, and characterization of fresh and spent catalysts."
"Recovery of enhanced gasoline-range fuel from catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene: Effect of heating rate, temperature, and catalyst on reaction kinetics, products yield, and compositions The present study focuses on the recovery of superior-quality pyrolytic oil (PO) from the pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (WPP). The optimum heating rate, temperature and catalyst dosing were identified from experimental pyrolysis runs in a batch pyrolyzer. The thermal pyrolysis at 550 0C at 20 0C/min produced 83.5% PO, the maximum yield. The activated zeolite and kaolin catalyst prepared from the low-cost natural zeolite and kaolin clay were used for catalytic pyrolysis. The specific surface areas were determined to be 16.45 and 13.62 m2/g, with pore sizes 18.5 and 20.6 nm for zeolite and kaolin, respectively. The catalytic dosing of 12% zeolite and 10% kaolin was found to be the most optimum towards maximum PO yield. The FTIR and GC-MS analysis provided the qualitative and quantitative identification of various hydrocarbons (HCs) in PO. The HCs were classified as diesel-range (DHC) and gasoline-range (GHC) based on the carbon numbers. The catalyst zeolite and kaolin enhanced the yield of GHC components in PO by 6.45 and 7.7%, respectively. The catalyst considerably reduced the density, viscosity and improved the flash and pour points of PO. Finally, the reaction mechanism and reaction kinetics of pyrolysis reaction were determined from thermogravimetric data obtained under identical reaction conditions as in batch pyrolyzer. A shift of the reaction mechanism with lower activation energy was identified in the presence of a catalyst. The detailed characterization of gaseous products and solid residues were also performed.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polypropylene with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and reaction kinetics."
"Strategic conversion of plastic containers with food waste into energy through thermochemical processes Plastic valorization has received particular attention as an environmentally benign approach to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, contaminated plastic and biomass waste mixtures suffer from single-stream recycling. Waste mixtures are currently discarded through landfilling and incineration. As a sustainable disposal and valorization method for converting plastic and biomass waste mixtures into energy-intensive products, especially syngas (H2 and CO), this study utilizes catalytic pyrolysis and a CO2 flow gas. A plastic container contaminated with a food waste mixture (PFW) was used as the model waste. The major products of the pyrolysis of PFW were liquid hydrocarbons (HC) (C7–30) and wax-like HCs with negligible formation of oxygen-containing HCs. However, the high production of wax-like HCs becomes a problem. Catalytic pyrolysis was employed to convert HCs into simpler product streams such as syngas. Although syngas formation tripled with the Ni catalyst, catalyst deactivation was observed. To suppress catalyst deactivation and promote CO formation, CO2 was introduced instead of N2. During the CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, the syngas yield from PFW increased to 95.5 % because the chemical reactions between CO2 and liquid/wax-like HCs produced additional H2 and CO. The catalytic reaction with CO2 suppressed carbon deposition because long-chain HCs were converted to CO rather than coke.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of contaminated plastic and food waste mixtures, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"In-situ sulfur fixation mechanism during microwave fluidized-bed co-pyrolysis of waste tires and biomass The disposal of waste tires (WT) presents significant environmental challenges, and microwave fluidized-bed pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution, though research remains limited. A major issue in WT pyrolysis is sulfur emission, which can be mitigated through co-pyrolysis with biomass. Co-pyrolysis between WT and two types of biomass (peanut shell (PS), Ascophyllum (AS)) was investigated, using a microwave fluidized-bed reactor, focusing on the in-situ sulfur fixation mechanism. The results show that co-pyrolysis led to higher char yield and lower gas yield than expected, with less sulfur released into the pyrolysis oil and more sulfur retained in the char. The interaction between the products of WT and biomass promoted the formation of macromolecular organic compounds, leading to an increase in aromatic hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil and inhibiting the release of sulfur-containing organic compounds. Sulfur in WT was oxidized by -OH radicals from biomass, forming solid oxygenated organic sulfur and reducing the catalytic decomposition of sulfur. Additionally, the retention of alkaline metals in biomass ash enhanced sulfur fixation. These findings suggest that microwave fluidized-bed co-pyrolysis of WT and biomass is effective in capturing sulfur and generating valuable hydrocarbons, providing a promising solution for managing urban and agricultural solid wastes sustainably.","The study involves microwave fluidized-bed pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic waste, with measurable product yields, sulfur fixation mechanisms, and analytical characterization of products."
"Catalytic stepwise pyrolysis of packaging plastic waste In this paper the combination of catalytic and stepwise pyrolysis is explored. A mixture of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), which resembles real municipal plastic waste, has been pyrolysed in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor at 440°C for 30min using a ZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst. A low temperature (300°C) dechlorination step has been carried out both with and without catalyst. It has been proved that the application of such dechlorination step gives rise to a 75wt% reduction of chlorine in the liquid fraction. However, such step has a negative influence on the catalyst, which loses some catalytic activity. The optimum procedure in terms of quality and chlorine content of the products is the combination of first a low temperature step without catalyst, and second the catalytic pyrolysis step.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET, PVC) using a semi-batch reactor with measured yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of paper biomass and plastic mixtures (HDPE (high density polyethylene), PP (polypropylene) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate)) and product analysis Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics (HDPE (high density polyethylene), PP (polypropylene) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate)) has been performed in a fixed-bed reactor in presence of cobalt based alumina, ceria and ceria-alumina catalysts to analyze the product distribution and selectivity. Catalysts are synthesized using co-precipitation method and characterized by BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area and XRD analysis. The effect of catalytic co-pyrolysis at different temperature with product distribution has been evaluated. The results have clearly shown the synergistic effect between biomass and plastics, the liquid products gradually increases forming with rise in the plastic content in the blend. Gaseous products have yielded most during pyrolysis of blend having biomass/plastics ratio of 5:1 with the presence of 40% Co/30% CeO2/30% Al2O3 catalyst with hydrogen gas production touched its peak of 47 vol%. Catalytic performance enhanced with increase with the cobalt loading, with best performance attributing to 40% Co/30% CeO2/30% Al2O3 catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PET) mixed with biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Valorisation of different waste plastics by pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming for hydrogen production The performance of an original two-step reaction system (pyrolysis and in-line reforming) was assessed in the hydrogen production from different plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene) and their mixture. The pyrolysis step was performed in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500 °C, whereas the reforming of pyrolysis volatiles was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at 700 °C. This two in-line reactor configuration was initially developed for the reforming of high density polyethylene pyrolysis volatiles, and this paper describes the influence composition of pyrolysis products derived from different plastics has on the reforming step, conversion, product yields and deactivation behavior. The products formed in both the pyrolysis and the reforming steps were analysed by on-line gas chromatography and micro-gas chromatography. Significant differences in the reforming behaviour of the plastics were observed, with hydrogen productions being higher in the case of polyolefins (from 34.8 to 37.3 wt% ) followed by polystyrene (29.1 wt%) and remarkably lower for polyethylene terephthalate (18.2 wt%). Furthermore, the evolution of conversion and product distribution with time on stream was assessed for the different plastics studied and the catalyst deactivation rate was related to the amount and morphology of the coke deposited on the reforming catalyst. It was proven that the features of the reactors used in the pyrolysis and reforming steps are suitable for minimizing operational problems, and therefore operating in continuous regime.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PET, PS) in a conical spouted bed reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of products."
"Catalytic and thermal depolymerization of low value post-consumer high density polyethylene plastic The feasibility of catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolytic conversion of low value post-consumer high density polyethylene (HPDE) plastic into crude oil and subsequent distillation was explored. Translation of optimized conditions for catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis from TGA to a bench-scale system was validated using another kind of plastic (HDPE). The properties of the plastic crude (PC) oil and residue were studied for boiling point distribution; molecular weight distribution; elemental composition; and thermal degradation. The plastic crude oils had properties similar to conventional crude oil. The resulting PC oils were distilled into motor gasoline, diesel #1, diesel #2, and vacuum gas oil fractions. An increase in gasoline and diesel-range fractions was observed with Y-zeolite and MgCO3 catalysts, respectively. Diesel and vacuum gas oil fractions were the major products in the absence of catalyst. The distillate fraction was characterized for fuel properties, elemental composition, boiling point, and molecular weight distribution. The fuel properties of the diesel-range distillate (diesel fraction) were comparable to those of ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. Market demand, growth, and value of end products will dictate which process, non-catalytic or catalytic (Y-Zeolite/MgCO3), is best suited for providing the product portfolio for a particular scenario.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer HDPE plastic with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and fuel properties analysis."
"Enhanced microwave absorption capacity of iron-based catalysts by introducing Co and Ni for microwave pyrolysis of waste COVID-19 Masks Inexpensive iron-based catalysts are the most promising catalysts for microwave-assisted deconstruction of waste plastics. However, the microwave heating efficiency of most of the synthesized iron-based catalysts is very low, in particular, the FeAl catalyst was prepared by microwave combustion method, and its mixture with disposable medical masks (DMMs) was only heated to about 150℃ within 10 min. Here, we introduce the second-phase metals (Co or Ni) into the FeAl catalyst, resulting in the rearrangement of the catalyst structure and electrons to give the catalyst good microwave absorption ability. The mixture of the catalyst and DMMs can be quickly heated to above 900℃ in 10 min, especially after reaching the melting point of plastic, the instantaneous heating rate reaches 350 ℃·min−1. under the unique microwave hot-spot pyrolysis mechanism, DMMs can be rapidly pyrolyzed into carbon nanotubes (19.65 wt%) and gas (77.65 wt%) within 14 min due to the efficient dehydrogenation efficiency and activity of Co. The corresponding H2 yield is up to 38.66 mmolH2·g−1 DMMs, and the percentage of CO and H2 in the gas is as high as 90 wt%. This work improves the microwave conversion efficiency of iron-based catalysts by introducing second phase metals, and waste DMMs were efficiently converted into CO, H2 and CNTs, which can also be extended to other polymer or biomass chemical cycles.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of waste COVID-19 masks (a type of plastic waste) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of products such as carbon nanotubes, gas, and hydrogen."
"Empiric model for the prediction of packaging waste pyrolysis yields The yield and characteristics of packaging waste pyrolysis products depend on the composition of the input material. The aim of this study is to predict the yield of the different pyrolysis fractions (organic liquid, aqueous liquid, gas, char, inorganics) as a function of the input waste composition. Nine real municipal packaging waste samples and four mixtures of pure materials prepared by the authors have been pyrolysed in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor at 500°C. The pyrolysis yields obtained in these experiments, together with some data about the pyrolysis yields of specific materials taken from the literature, have been used as raw data for developing the prediction model. The model parameters have been obtained by means of multiple linear regression of the experimental data. The accuracy of the predicted values is influenced by the nature of the specific sample; the predicted values are more accurate when mixtures of pure materials are studied than when real complex samples are considered. Anyway, the predicted values are acceptable enough to be a useful tool for designing industrial processes. Additionally, the model is easily used since it only requires a few composition data.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real municipal packaging waste and pure plastic materials in a semi-batch reactor, with measurable yields and product characterization, demonstrating experimental data for model development."
"Production of liquid hydrocarbons, carbon nanotubes and hydrogen rich gases from waste plastic in a multi-core reactor In this paper, a new reactor design based on central core heating system is presented that optimized the heat utilization and allowed compact reactor design. Conversion of waste plastic into liquid hydrocarbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen rich gases in a multi–core reactor was carried out. Thermal energy from central core was utilized for the pyrolysis of waste plastic and synthesis of CNTs. Pyrolysis of waste plastic was carried out in the outer chamber of reactor followed by catalytic decomposition of pyrolysis gases in the inner chamber. Tray arrangement inside CNT chamber provided maximum catalyst holdup and effective solid–gas contact. Reactor performance was studied at different pyrolysis temperatures and a fixed CNT synthesis temperature of 800°C. Multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) having 20–50nm diameters and average wall thickness of 10nm were synthesized with an yield of 6.03g/30g polyethylene.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (polyethylene) in a multi-core reactor, with measurable product yields (6.03g/30g MWCNTs), temperature-dependent performance, and characterization of products."
"Pyrolysis of plastic wastes in a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor: Determination of stable operating conditions The performance of both fluidized and spouted bed reactors in the pyrolysis of waste plastics is conditioned by particle agglomeration phenomena, which worsens the quality of the gas–solid contact and eventually lead to defluidization. The objective of this work is to determine the optimum conditions for stable operation (without defluidization) in a bench scale plant fitted with a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor and equipped with a nonporous draft tube, which operates in continuous mode. The insertion of these devices enhances the gas–solid contact, especially in the fountain region, and leads to a highly stable hydrodynamic regime, with these features being of especial relevance for the in situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics. This paper deals with the effect different variables have on the minimum temperature for stable operation by avoiding defluidization. The variables analyzed are as follows: plastic type (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET and PMMA), plastic feed rate, mass of inert material in the bed, spouting velocity and use of catalyst. The results show that polymers whose chains decompose at low temperatures or have high degrees of branching require low operating temperatures. Besides, as the ratio of bed mass to plastic feed rate (Wbed/Qplastic) and/or spouting velocity were increased, the temperature required to avoid defluidization was also reduced. The use of a catalyst also reduced the temperature required for stable operation, as the activation energy of cracking reactions is greatly reduced, and so reaction rate is increased.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET, PMMA) in a continuous fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor with measurable parameters such as temperature, feed rate, catalyst use, and stable operation conditions, including product yield and reaction performance indicators."
"Influence of zeolite hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on water-assisted polyethylene hydrocracking The catalytic upcycling of polyethylene (PE) remains a major challenge in sustainable waste management. This study demonstrates that water promotes PE hydrocracking over Ru/zeolite catalysts only when the support framework is strongly hydrophilic, as in HY and HMOR. Systematic characterization reveals that this promotional effect is governed by surface wettability, rather than acidity or metal dispersion. Thermodynamic analysis confirms that water and PE are immiscible under reaction conditions, ruling out direct water–polymer interactions. Instead, water preferentially associates with hydrophilic catalyst surfaces, promoting Brønsted acid activity through confined hydration. Controlled experiments show that direct contact between water and the catalyst is essential for enhanced reactivity; spatial separation between the two leads to suppressed conversion, likely due to unfavorable interactions between water and the molten polymer. These findings highlight the mechanistic role of interfacial water–catalyst accessibility and establish catalyst hydrophilicity as a key design parameter for reliable and efficient water-assisted hydrocracking. The results have practical implications for processing moisture-containing plastic waste streams.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic hydrocracking of polyethylene (a waste plastic) with measurable catalyst performance and product behavior under controlled conditions, including water-assisted reactions and surface characterization."
"Two-steps selective thermal depolymerization of polyethylene. 1: Feasibility and effect of devolatilization heating policy Aiming at controlling the selective depolymerization via the thermal route, we investigated a two-stage process, where volatiles are produced in a low temperature (800°C, residence time <1.3s). Splitting the process allows to control the reaction times independently and circumvent limitations of a multiphase reacting system, where melting contrasts a rapid heating. The two-stage process with independent melting can dramatically improve the olefins yield, and particularly that of ethene. A proper heating policy in the 1st thermal decomposition affects the species distribution in the intermediate product (oils and waxes). The following gas phase, short contact time thermal cracking takes advantage of a ‘tailored’ feedstock, to drive the products distribution towards a larger amount of ethene. With the two-stages sequential process we achieved cumulated ethene yields from LLPDE in excess of 45wt.% with respect to polymer fed. While gas yield approaches 85wt.%, up to 75wt.% of the gas can be ethene at suitable conditions. Indications to improve the interesting results are discussed.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Biomass waste conversion into value-added products via microwave-assisted Co-Pyrolysis platform The current work is focused to investigate the synergetic interactions between biomass (groundnut shell, bagasse, rice husk, Prosopis juliflora, mixed wood sawdust) and hydro-rich plastics (Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and Polyisoprene (PIP)) in microwave co-pyrolysis. The heating value of co-pyrolysis oil (38–42 MJ kg−1) was enhanced dramatically compared to biomass pyrolysis oil (20–28 MJ kg−1). Among biomasses studied, the energy yield of bio-oil obtained from rice husk with LDPE mixture is higher (42%). Whereas bio-oil from polyisoprene and groundnut shell mixture has the highest energy yield (78%). Each gram of co-pyrolysis feedstock consumed 12–18 kJ of incident microwave energy. An increase in overall energy efficiency in co-pyrolysis (62–70%) is observed compared to that of biomass pyrolysis (46–57%). Actual mass yield (31–47 wt%) of co-pyrolysis bio-crude is lower than its predicted value (42–57 wt%) due to the formation of lighter gases. In the combinations of and hydrogen-rich plastics considered in this study, it was found that co-pyrolysis of LDPE: bagasse has produced bio-crude with the highest yield of aliphatic hydrocarbons (25.78%), and co-pyrolysis of LDPE: rice husk has produced bio-crude with high selectivity of aromatics (11.7%). The extent of de-oxygenation was promoted in the co-pyrolysis due to synergy.","The study involves lab-scale microwave co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, PIP) with biomass, reporting measurable product yields, energy efficiency, and product composition analysis."

"Time and temperature depended fuel gas generation from pyrolysis of real world municipal plastic waste On a large scale, amount of pyrolytic gas generated and their components has a very important role in product recovery in form of energy. The obtained gases having HHV can be utilized for generation of power or can be utilized in the process itself to reduce the input energy and helps to become self sustainable process. In the present study, real world municipal plastic waste mainly comprising of polyethylene (low and high density), polypropylene, polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate were pyrolyzed at different temperatures, ranging 450–600°C with a sample mass of 200g to create an appropriate real blend environment. The non-condensable gaseous product generation profile was studied along with heat transfer profile in reactor. The effect and formation of gaseous products was explained based on experimental investigation which shows an increase in H2 on increasing the temperature with decrease in low molecular weight hydrocarbons. In addition, the identification of non-condensable gaseous components was done using gas chromatography. Effect of residence time was strong at higher temperature process conditions producing heavier hydrocarbons in gas; and in oil as wax. Increase in operating temperature increased the concentration of H2 whereas no effect on formation of CO and CO2 was observed. Recovery time of non-condensable gases was less at higher temperature whereas yield increases on increasing the operating temperature. Residence time of volatiles in reactor affected the formation of hydrocarbons like ethylene, propane and n-butane.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real-world municipal plastic waste (PE, PP, PS, PET) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent gas generation, and GC analysis of gaseous products."
"Study of kinetics of co-pyrolysis of coal and waste LDPE blends under argon atmosphere Co-pyrolysis of coal with waste plastic is increasingly being looked upon as a potential technique to counter the present day challenges in energy and waste management by harnessing the multiple benefits associated with the same. In the present work, the kinetics of co-pyrolysis of waste LDPE carried out with coal of Ledo origin from the coalfields of Assam (India) has been studied. A thermo-gravimetric (TG) study of the co-pyrolysis has been carried out taking waste LDPE-coal mixtures in ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 by weight and at five varying heating rates from 5 to 25Kmin−1 with a 5K increment. Experiments were also carried out for the individual components at all the five heating rates. This TG analysis data was used to evaluate the kinetics parameters such as the activation energy, pre-exponential factors, and the reaction orders, applying a model fitting approach. The results of the kinetics analysis indicate higher activation energy for the mixtures. With increase in the coal percentage, the reaction order is found to increase. Also the synergistic effect between the two sample species in the mixtures has been studied and found to indicate presence of interaction between coal and LDPE. The effect of sample composition on the products of co-pyrolysis has also been compared.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste LDPE mixed with coal, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and kinetic parameters derived from TG analysis."
"Use of plastic waste as a fuel in the co-pyrolysis of biomass. Part I: The effect of the addition of plastic waste on the process and products The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of using polypropylene, a common polymer used in the polymer industry, in the co-pyrolysis of two types of biomass. This study is crucial because different types of biomass exhibit different behaviours, which are mainly influenced by the chemical composition of the material (amount of cellulose, lignocellulose and hemicellulose). In our previous study, polymer addition to biomass led to synergistic effects, as determined by variations in the amounts of products obtained from the co-pyrolysis of biomass and polypropene relative to those obtained from the pyrolysis of pure biomass or polypropylene. In this work, the effects of using polymer material as an additional eco-fuel on the thermal conversion process are discussed. The addition of polypropylene reduces the amount of heat energy needed in the thermal conversion of biomass.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with biomass, demonstrating measurable effects on product yields and thermal conversion, with explicit mention of reactor conditions and product analysis."
"Valorization of the plastic residue from a WEEE treatment plant by pyrolysis The possibility of a pyrolysis process as a mean of recycling the residual plastic rich fraction (WEEE residue) derived from of a material recovery facility has been evaluated. The unknown product composition of WEEE residue has been supposed through coupled thermal – infrared analysis and ultimate analysis and resulted as PP 3 wt%, PBT 3 wt%, PVC 4 wt%, styrene-based polymers (principally ABS) 50 wt%, thermosetting resins (principally, epoxy/phenolic resins) 24 wt%, inorganic fraction (principally fiber glass) 16 wt%. DSC experiments showed that the overall energy, defined as the degradation heat, needed in order to completely degrade WEEE residue was about 4% of the exploitable energy of the input material. The effect of temperature and different zeolite catalysts were investigated, in particular in terms of yield and quality of the produced oils during the pyrolysis process. Produced oils were potentially exploitable as fuels and almost all catalysts improved their quality. The best performance was reached by NaUSY(5.7) with the second highest production of light oil and the greatest total monoaromatics yield, plus 12 wt% in comparison to thermal pyrolysis experiments. Furthermore, light oil produced by NaUSY(5.7) has one of the best LHV (36 MJ/kg) and no halogenated compounds were detected by GC–MS analysis. Char or pyrolytic gas combustion could supply the energy required for the thermal degradation of WEEE Residue.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic-rich WEEE residue with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis, and reactor condition evaluation."
"Mitigation of bromine-containing products during pyrolysis of polycarbonate-based tetrabromobisphenol A in the presence of copper(I) oxide Polycarbonate (PC) is an engineering thermoplastic that is widely used in electrical and electronic equipment. This plastic often contains tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), the most common brominated flame retardant. Thermal degradation of the PC-TBBA leads to generation of numerous bromo-organic products in the pyrolytic oil, hindering its appropriate utilization, as well as corrosive hydrogen bromide gas. The purpose of this study was to experimentally investigate and compare the pyrolysis products of PC-TBBA and PC-TBBA + Cu2O at various temperatures, with an emphasis on the yield and distribution of brominated compounds. In pyrolysis of PC-TBBA + Cu2O, at the maximum degradation temperature (600 °C), as much as 86% of total Br was trapped in the residue, while 3% and 11% were distributed in the condensate and gas fractions, respectively. In contrast, the distribution of Br from non-catalytic pyrolysis of PC-TBBA (600 °C) was 0.5% residue, 40% condensate, and 60% gas. The results of this study revealed that in the presence of Cu2O, organo-bromine products were most likely involved in Ullman-type coupling reactions, leading to early cross-linking of the polymer network that efficiently hinders their vaporization. HBr in the gas fraction was suppressed due to effective fixation of bromine in residue in the form of CuBr.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polycarbonate (PC) containing tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), with measurable product yields, bromine distribution, and catalyst performance data."
"Upcycling polymeric wastes into multi-walled carbon nanotubes via dual-stage pyrolysis: advancing sustainable resource recovery The persistent accumulation of polymeric wastes, typically disposable face masks in cleanroom protocols, medical sectors and public health, presents a significant environmental challenge. This study explores the conversion of polymeric waste into valuable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through an integrated dual-stage pyrolysis system. The first stage featured the optimization of hydrocarbon gas from waste pyrolysis before sending for CNT production. It was conducted at 500 ℃ with a heating rate of 20 ℃/min to transform wastes into hydrocarbon gas. Ni was impregnated onto a ZSM-5 support in varying concentrations, with 5 % Ni/ZSM-5 achieving the highest hydrocarbon gas yield (47 wt%), including 79.1 % of C1–C3 hydrocarbons. The second stage highlighted the actual methane consumption for CNT formation and the optimum growth temperature. The C1–C3 hydrocarbons were channeled to the second stage to synthesize CNTs, aided by a NiMoCa catalyst. At 750 ℃, the actual methane consumption peaked at 22.7 %, resulting in CNTs with low defects (IG/ID = 2.1 and IG’/ID = 1.4) and a uniform diameter of 30–60 nm. With a precisely tuned gas composition and controlled production of CNTs with targeted quality, this system promotes the circular economy of upcycling polymeric waste into advanced resources.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polymeric waste (disposable face masks) to produce hydrocarbon gas and CNTs, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product characterization."
"Pyrolytic upcycling of plastic waste into graphene and carbon nanostructures The escalating accumulation of plastic waste poses a significant environmental challenge, while the high cost of graphene production limits its widespread application. Addressing both issues, this study presents a sustainable and efficient approach to upcycle plastic waste into graphene-like carbon nanostructures with tailored morphology. A two-stage catalytic pyrolysis process was employed to convert common plastic wastes— high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate—into graphitic nanomaterials and hydrogen-rich gases. To enhance efficiency, bimetallic catalysts (Fe–Ni, Co–Fe, Co–Ni) supported on MgO were synthesized using impregnation and coprecipitation methods. Among these, Fe–Ni–Mg prepared via coprecipitation exhibited the highest catalytic activity, yielding carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. Polystyrene waste produced the highest yield of graphene-like multiwalled carbon nanotubes, while polyethylene terephthalate was less effective due to its oxygen-rich composition.

"Effect of poly(ethylene terephthalate) on the pyrolysis of brominated flame retardant containing high impact polystyrene and catalytic debromination of the liquid products The pyrolysis of brominated flame retardant containing high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) mixed with poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) was performed at 430°C under atmospheric pressure by a batch operation. The addition of PET to HIPS-Br affected significantly the formation of decomposition products and the degradation behavior of HIPS-Br. We have found the following observations on the addition of PET during the pyrolysis of HIPS-Br: (i) the rate of formation and the yield of liquid products decreased, (ii) the residue and gaseous products formation increased, (iii) the average carbon number (Cnp) of liquid products reduced from 12.5 to 9.1, (iv) the yield of high molecular weight hydrocarbons (C16–C20) decreased and the amount of hydrocarbons from C6 to C10 doubled, (v) heavy waxy compounds were formed on the top of the glass reactor wall in addition to the solid residue on the bottom of the reactor, (vi) antimony compounds were observed in the solid residue, as opposed to the formation of antimony tribromide (SbBr3) detected in the liquid products of HIPS-Br in the absence of PET. We attempted the debromination of brominated liquid hydrocarbons using iron and calcium based carbon composites for the production of halogen free liquid hydrocarbons, which can be used as a feedstock in a refinery or as a fuel.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics (HIPS-Br and PET) with measurable product yields, compositional analysis, and catalyst performance evaluation."
"Controlling liquid hydrocarbon composition in valorization of plastic waste via tuning zeolite framework and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio Abundance of plastic waste has become threat to the mankind and aquatic life and thus needs to be recycled or converted into value added products. Liquefaction of waste plastics via catalytic cracking is one the efficient routes towards plastic waste management. Concerning this, in present study, conversion of polymer mixture containing polypropylene, low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene (PP, LDPE and HDPE) was done for the production of gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons using two-step cracking approach. MWW and MFI (12 and 10 member ring structures respectively) type zeolites having different pore structure and acidity were used for catalytic cracking of polymer feed at 350 °C. Investigations revealed that MWW type zeolite having two independent pore channels selectively provides gasoline range of hydrocarbons (C7–C12, 99.12%) in polymer cracking reaction as compared to MFI type which results in C13–C20 range of hydrocarbons (73.19%). Hydrocarbon compositions were confirmed from GC-MS, 1H, 13C NMR and FT-IR techniques. In activity results it was observed that acidity of zeolites affects the liquid yield and hydrocarbon distribution as analysed by using zeolites of two different SiO2/Al2O3 (SAR) ratio (30 and 55) which directs that zeolite (MFI/MWW) with lower SAR (30) having higher acidity results in higher yield of fuel range liquid hydrocarbons as compared to higher SAR (55) zeolite. Characterization studies such as XRD, N2-physisorption, NH3-TPD, FE-SEM and EDX were performed to check the physiochemical properties of zeolite and correlated with the activity. Overall, the present investigation provides detailed comparative study on plastic degradation using MFI and MWW type zeolites resulting into different range of liquid hydrocarbons.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, LDPE, HDPE) in a lab-scale reactor, with measurable yields, product composition analysis via GC-MS, and characterization of catalysts and products."
"Tandem fluidized bed/milli-second fixed bed reactor produces methacrylic acid from poly(methyl methacrylate) Producing monomers from end-of-life plastics is a sustainable alternative to petroleum as a feedstock. Fluidized beds are more effective than molten metal baths and agitated vessels to deconstruct poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to MMA because of their higher heat transfer rates. Here, we developed a tandem reactor to produce methacrylic acid (MAA). PMMA depolymerized to MMA in a fluidized bed of sand above 300 ∘C in the first step and then MMA hydrolyzed to MAA over zeolite Y suspended in glass wool at a contact time of 200 ms. MAA yield approached 48% while MMA conversion was about 50%. At high temperatures, cyclic hydrocarbons produced during the reaction condensed in the fixed bed hydrolysis section and reactor lines. Reacting PMMA to MAA in a tandem reactor is of industrial interest for end-of-life PMMA containing fillers and additives because of the higher MAA yield compared to reprocessing MAA in a single vessel.","The study involves pyrolysis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a commercial plastic, in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance, including experimental characterization and yield data."
"Valorisation of medical waste through the staged pyrolysis: effect of pyrolysis conditions on chlorine removal and product formation Medical waste, posing pathogen and toxin risks, endangers the environment and public health. Staged pyrolysis, segmenting pyrolysis with distinct conditions to release components stepwise, offers a viable solution for its safe disposal and the synergistic production of clean fuels and high-value chemicals. However, a limited understanding of how pyrolysis parameters influence chlorine removal and product formation hampers the practical implementation of medical waste thermochemical conversion. Based on response surface methodology, the impacts of key conditions during the low-temperature dechlorination stage (Stage I) on product yields and chlorine migration pathway were firstly analyzed. The optimal conditions for dechlorinated semi-char production were 309.5 °C, 8.5 °C/min, and 39.2 min, under which 83.2 % of chlorine underwent dechlorination and migrated to the gas phase in the form of HCl, enabling its removal via water washing. HCl released from infusion tubes catalyzed the dehydration of medical gauze, while the hydroxyl groups of medical gauze promoted the dehydrochlorination of PVC. In the dechlorinated semi-char re-pyrolysis stage (Stage II), for chlorine migration, high heating rates favored HCl (HCl reacted with NH3 to form NH4Cl, which dissolved in oil.), while low rates increased CH3Cl (Over 99 % of total chlorine-containing gas.). Inorganic chlorine (KCl/NaCl) in char remained stable, with organic chlorine accumulating with increasing heating rates. Elevated temperatures/heating rates doubled H2, CH4, and C3H6 yields via accelerated secondary reactions and promoted heavy aromatization of pyrolytic oil. These insights into chlorine removal and product evolution optimize staged pyrolysis, which promotes resource-emission synergy and eco-friendly treatment of medical waste.","The study involves lab-scale staged pyrolysis of medical waste plastics, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and chlorine migration analysis."
"Fluidized bed thermal degradation products of HDPE in an inert atmosphere and in air–nitrogen mixtures Different processes involving thermal decomposition such as incineration, pyrolysis, gasification or co-combustion are becoming important for energy generation using plastic wastes as combustible materials. The thermal degradation of the material, the product distribution and consequently the economics of the process are strongly influenced by the experimental conditions used. In this work, the thermal degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out using a fluidized bed reactor under different temperature conditions. Two types of experiments have been performed, pyrolysis experiments, in which nitrogen has been used as inert gas, and gasification experiments, meaning that the thermal decomposition has been carried out in a nitrogen–air mixture with low oxygen concentration. The influence of the operating parameters on the product distribution and gas composition has been investigated using GC and MS/GC for the analysis of the gas, wax and oil fractions obtained. The results obtained show a widely differing product yield in both processes. The main objective of the paper is a comparison of pyrolysis and gasification in terms of the generation of products of high heating value, and the energy requirements for the thermal degradation and production of residues and polyaromatic compounds. An optimum interval of operation temperatures is suggested in order to obtain high yield to gases of high heating values and low yield to PAHs.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized bed pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic, with measurable product yields, gas composition analysis via GC–MS, and temperature–yield relationships."
"Characterization of Products from the Pyrolysis of Municipal Solid Waste Pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the form of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) was performed in a fixed bed reactor to recover char, oil/wax and combustible gases. It was established that the yield and composition of the products recovered depended on temperature; the percentage yield of char fell as the pyrolysis temperature was raised from 400°C to 700°C, whereas that of oil/wax and gaseous products rose. The chars recovered were also found to have properties which depended on the size fraction analysed. The gaseous product evolved during the pyrolysis had a high calorific value, making the gases suitable for use as a fuel. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-ir) of the derived oils, indicated that they were chemically very complex and highly oxygenated, and have the potential of being used either as a petrochemical feedstock or as a substitute liquid fuel.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of municipal solid waste containing plastic waste, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent results, and analytical characterization of products."
"Natural aluminosilicates for catalytic depolymerization of polyethylene to produce liquid fuel-grade hydrocarbons and low olefins Different chemical modifications were performed to the natural aluminosilicate Montanit300® in order to improve its catalytic activity in PE depolymerization. Performance of such prepared catalysts was compared to established solid acid catalysts, such as HZSM-5, sulfonated and fluorinated γ-Al2O3 and amorphous silica–alumina. Pyridine TG and DRIFTS characterization revealed mild acid treatment and aluminum grafting as successful in increasing acid site density through impurity removal and specific surface area increase. Mesoporous catalyst structure that allows facile diffusion through its pore network, together with high-density Brønsted acid sites, was found to be crucial to obtain high catalytic activity. The T 50 value for PE depolymerization was lowered by 162°C with sulfonated γ-Al2O3 solid, compared to non-catalyzed reaction, whereas with aluminum-grafted Montanit300® catalyst this value was lowered by 65°C. PE depolymerization products present in the condensed liquid phase using aluminum-grafted Montanit300® catalyst were exclusively alkanes with chain length up to 21 carbon atoms. Liquid, coke and gas yields were found to be 53, 0.4 and 46.6%, respectively, the latter consisting of linear and branched C2–C4 alkenes and alkanes.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene, a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Experimental investigation of the influence of reaction atmosphere on the pyrolysis of printed circuit boards Printed circuit boards (PCB) are one of the most challenging fractions of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in terms of recycling due to their complexity and diversity. Pyrolysis seems to be a promising alternative for production of energy carriers from its organic fraction with simultaneous recovery of metals. Reaction atmosphere is among the process parameters that affects the thermal decomposition as well as the products’ formation and distribution. In this study, the decomposition of two different PCB fractions in inert and steam atmospheres has been investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and lab scale fixed bed reactor experiments. It was found that the decomposition of the tested materials in steam atmosphere starts at lower temperatures and proceeds slower compared to the N2 atmosphere. Moreover, a two-step decomposition has been observed on the PCB sockets fraction due to the fact that high amount of antimony oxide was present, a common additive for improving the flame retardancy, which have been also observed on previous studies (Wu et al., 2014). The presence of steam influence the pyrolysis gas composition and promotes additional vaporisation of antimony as verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the liquid fraction has been qualitatively analysed using a GC/MS in order to determine the brominated compounds as well as other compounds that are produced from this process.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on waste plastic-containing printed circuit boards, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization including GC/MS, XRD, and SEM."
"Kinetic modelling and measurement of catalyst deactivation for the catalytic co-pyrolysis of PP and PET with HZSM-5 The catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of PP and PET with HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was conducted for various catalyst to feedstock (CF) ratios, PP to PET ratios, and heating rates using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) isoconversional approach was used to determine apparent activation energies for the non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of PP and PET. An nth-order reaction scheme was used to model the pyrolysis at various operating conditions through the optimization of the associated kinetic parameters. Additional TGA experiments were conducted with used catalysts to gain insight into catalyst deactivation, and it was found that the inclusion of PET led to more severe deactivation. Collidine temperature programmed desorption (TPD) indicated the loss of external acid sites for catalysts coked by PET pyrolysis, explaining the severe deactivation. Catalyst deactivation was incorporated into the kinetic modelling approach, so that degradation profiles could be predicted for experiments with the used catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics PP and PET with HZSM-5 catalyst, including measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Pyrolysis of plastic packaging waste: A comparison of plastic residuals from material recovery facilities with simulated plastic waste Pyrolysis may be an alternative for the reclamation of rejected streams of waste from sorting plants where packing and packaging plastic waste is separated and classified. These rejected streams consist of many different materials (e.g., polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), aluminum, tetra-brik, and film) for which an attempt at complete separation is not technically possible or economically viable, and they are typically sent to landfills or incinerators. For this study, a simulated plastic mixture and a real waste sample from a sorting plant were pyrolyzed using a non-stirred semi-batch reactor. Red mud, a byproduct of the aluminum industry, was used as a catalyst. Despite the fact that the samples had a similar volume of material, there were noteworthy differences in the pyrolysis yields. The real waste sample resulted, after pyrolysis, in higher gas and solid yields and consequently produced less liquid. There were also significant differences noted in the compositions of the compared pyrolysis products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real and simulated plastic waste mixtures (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, ABS) using a semi-batch reactor, with measurable yields and product composition analysis."

"Microwave catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and spent bleaching clay for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons Combined with the fact that the poor heat transfer effect of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), the microwave absorption characteristics of spent bleaching clay (SBC) and the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis, we conducted a study. In this study, microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of SBC and LDPE was used to produce bio-oil rich in monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). Then the conditions of co-pyrolysis, including pyrolysis temperature, catalytic temperature, the ratio of SBC/LDPE and catalytic mass were explored. The findings revealed that SBC and LDPE had a synergistic effect, SBC had microwave absorption characteristics, which could transfer heat to LDPE to improve heating rate. And the high H/Ceff of LDPE promoted the deoxidation of the SBC, which could optimize the quality of bio-oil. Compared with 43.69% for LDPE pyrolysis alone and 47.18% for SBC pyrolysis alone, the content of MAHs during co-pyrolysis was 54.92%. The optimum pyrolysis parameter was discovered at the pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, 450 °C of catalytic temperature, 40:28.5 ratio of SBC to LDPE, 7 g of HZSM-5 mass, 69.89% of MAHs and 16.48% of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was obtained.","The study involves microwave catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (a waste plastic) and spent bleaching clay, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analysis of bio-oil composition including monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."
"In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires over clays for high quality pyrolysis products This paper aims to evaluate the effect of low-cost clays (kaolin with different particle size and montmorillonite (MTT) modified with ZnCl2 and HCl) as catalysts on the pyrolysis products from waste tire. The results show that clays can improve the quality and yield of pyrolysis products. Different particle size and modification conditions have significant influence on the distribution and component of pyrolysis products. Compared with blank group, the content of combustible gas (including CH4 of 56.35%, H2 of 35.67% and CO of 7.98%) in ZnCl2 group is increased. Moreover, the hydrocarbon content of pyrolysis oil in each group exceed 90%. The N-containing compounds can be removed by hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) reaction and convert into aromatics through ring-opening reaction. Meanwhile, the yield of the O-containing compounds in each group is less than 3%, and the lowest content is ZnCl2 group. ZnCl2-modified MTT have high specific surface area and rich mesoporous structure, which can promote deoxidation and aromatization to reach the highest aromatics content (90.23%). In addition, the content of C11–C20 in addition groups can be increased by small molecule polymerization. The catalysts promote the formation of diesel fraction through alkylation of benzene and naphthalene.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires (a plastic-containing waste material) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Aromatic production from high-density polyethylene over zinc promoted HZSM-5 The nature of Zn species and their roles in catalytic cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) thermal decomposing vapor over Zn-promoted HZSM-5 (Zn/Z5) for aromatics were investigated. The Zn/Z5 zeolites were prepared using ion exchange and impregnation methods followed by H2 reduction. Results indicated that hydrogen reduction of the Zn/Z5 significantly improved the aromatic yield. [ZnOH]+ and bridged Zn2+ species were critical species promoting BTX formation, with the former demonstrating higher activity. Besides, the synergistic effect between the Zn species and Brønsted acid sites on HZSM-5 boosts the aromatic yield. Incorporation of Zn was also found to promote long-chain scission. Among all the Zn/Z5, hydrogen reduced 2 wt% Zn/Z5 (SAR=25) is most effective in producing BTX, with a maximum yield of BTX (48%) and BTX selectivity (93%); hydrogen reduced 2 wt% Zn/Z5 (SAR=50) produced the highest yield of total aromatics (53%).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using Zn-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis reported."
"Influence of reaction pressure on co-pyrolysis of LDPE and a heavy petroleum fraction Pyrolysis of waste plastics to recycle valuable hydrocarbons represents an attractive technology for reducing waste and providing feedstocks for petrochemical products and fuels. Via the simultaneous processing of heavy petroleum residue fractions, synergies can be harnessed by converting bottom-of-the-barrel refining products into lighter fractions with higher value while improving processability of plastic waste materials. To investigate the effect of reactor pressure, a continuous laboratory co-pyrolysis plant was operated. The setup consisted of two consecutive tubular zones to convert a mixture of LDPE and a heavy petroleum residue to a final temperature of 450 °C at different pressures between 2 and 10 bar. The products were evaluated regarding obtained mass yields and their boiling range. Gaseous and liquid products increased with enhanced pressure, resulting in nearly tripled gas and light liquid formation, whereas more unconverted feed was consumed. Because the reactor pressure also affects the residence time by suppressing evaporation, which subsequently varies between 360 and 440 s, further investigations considering the dependence of product yields on the residence time over a range of 280 to 480 s were necessary. The comparison resulted in the conclusion that the enhancing effect of increased reactor pressure is not only caused by a retention time elongation in the hot reactor zone. Other physical effects also play a role, such as promoted heat transmission and a direct intervention of reactor pressure with the chemical reactions. In the tested range, an enhancing effect of higher reactor pressures on the cracking of the reaction mixture was observed. These novel experimental results indicate, that conversion toward lighter cracking products can be increased by pressure adjustments and highlights that the pressure should be included in process optimizations.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) and a heavy petroleum fraction, with measurable product yields, pressure–yield relationships, and reactor condition analysis."
"Syngas production through CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) with a cobalt-based catalyst Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is a representative copolymer widely adopted across various sectors owing to its superior physiochemical properties; however, an environmentally benign protocol for the disposal of EVA waste has not yet been established owing to the various ratios of acetate to polyethylene. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an innovative thermochemical technique for converting EVA waste into energy resources, specifically syngas. CO2 was used to enhance the environmental sustainability of pyrolysis. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that most of the EVA (approximately 99 wt%) was converted into pyrolytic oil and gases. However, the mechanistic features of CO2 in the pyrolysis of EVA could not be fully elucidated through single- or double-stage pyrolysis owing to the slow kinetics of the homogeneous reaction between CO2 and volatiles. To expedite the reaction kinetics, we used a cobalt (Co)-based catalyst (Co/SiO2). In the presence of Co/SiO2, the concentration of CO produced under CO2 was approximately 30-fold higher than that under N2. Furthermore, the homogeneous reactions resulted in fewer benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the pyrolytic oil under CO2 conditions. These experimental findings suggest that CO2 and EVA could serve as valuable feedstocks for the production of energy.",The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste EVA plastic with measurable syngas yields and product composition analysis under CO2 and N2 atmospheres.
"In situ grown metallic nickel from X–Ni (X=La, Mg, Sr) oxides for converting plastics into carbon nanotubes: Influence of metal–support interaction The process of pyrolysis and in-line catalysis was employed for converting plastics into value-added carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The metallic nickel catalysts Ni/X (X = La, Mg, Sr) were prepared through in situ growth from parent X–Ni oxides under reductive conditions and used for the catalytic synthesis of CNTs. The results showed that the activities of nickel catalysts decreased in the order of Ni/La > Ni/Sr > Ni/Mg, which strongly depended on the degree of metal–support interaction. The strong metal–support interaction in Ni/Mg catalyst was not favorable for the exsolution of large amount of metallic Ni, resulting in the lowest yield of CNTs. On the other hand, the weak metal–support interaction in Ni/Sr was unfavorable for the high coverage of Ni nanoparticles, leading to the simultaneous growth of carbon nano-onions and CNTs. The Ni/La catalyst with moderate metal–support interaction exhibited the highest yield of CNTs due to optimized amount, size and surface coverage of Ni nanoparticles. The microstructure, graphitization degree, quality and purity of obtained carbon products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. This study demonstrated an effective and delicate approach to tune the supported metal nanoparticles, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.","The study involves pyrolysis of plastics with catalytic conversion to carbon nanotubes, includes lab-scale reactor operation with measured catalyst performance and product yields, and provides extractable experimental data on CNT yield and product characterization."
"Hydrocarbon generation during the inert gas pyrolysis of automobile shredder waste When junked automobiles are shredded to recover the ferrous and non-ferrous metals, a large quantity of non-metallic waste is generated. These waste materials consist mainly of rubber and plastics. In this paper, the product yields and compositions obtained during inert gas pyrolysis of a representative shredder non-metallic waste fraction in three different experimental systems (batch thermogravimetric analyzer, bench scale batch pyrolyzer, and continuous rotary kiln) are compared. Analysis of the products by GC, HPLC, GC-MS, IR spectroscopy, H+ NMR and GPC show the presence of many hydrocarbon compounds with no single species present in large concentrations. Weight loss kinetics during the pyrolysis are also presented and discussed. The products obtained without additional processing are complex and contain compunds that prevent their direct use as a fuel in many applications. As a result, commercial exploitation of this process must await evaluation of the products obtained and, if necessary, the costs of purification and modification of the products to more useful compositions.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics from automobile shredder waste, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis via GC-MS and other techniques, and reactor condition data."
"Two-stage co-pyroysis behaviors and product distribution of Enteromorpha and marine waste polypropylene catalyzed by Cu/HZSM-5 A two-stage co-pyrolysis approach was developed for the efficient utilization of marine waste plastics and biomass, with a focus on the influence of biomass components. HZSM-5 was modified with Cu via wet impregnation and applied in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Enteromorpha and polypropylene under varying catalyst-to-feedstock ratios. The Cu/HZSM-5 catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that Cu modification preserved the HZSM-5 framework while increasing pore size, enhancing catalytic cracking efficiency. Thermogravimetric and kinetic analyses revealed that Cu/HZSM-5 lowered the pyrolysis temperature, reduced residues, improved synergy, and decreased activation energy without altering the reaction mechanism. The catalyst significantly reduced oxygenated compounds and enhanced the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil products, reaching a maximum aromatic content of 90.20 % at a 6:5 catalyst-to-feedstock ratio in the second stage. Under the same conditions, hydrogen production in the gas phase also peaked at 47.91 %. Increased catalyst dosage decreased carbon and hydrogen content in the char while raising oxygen and nitrogen levels, with a higher H/C ratio mitigating char aromatization and densification. A reaction mechanism for Enteromorpha and polypropylene over Cu/HZSM-5 was proposed.

"Fuel production from liquefaction of polypropylene in n-hexane solvent The excessive generation of plastic waste has become a major threat to the environment. Petroleum-based plastics, however, provided the opportunity for its re-conversion into fuel oil. In this study, polypropylene plastic was liquefied to produce liquid fuels in the presence of n-hexane solvent. The study was performed in a batch reactor at temperatures between 350 and 400 °C, reaction times between 0 and 150 min, and solvent-to-plastic mass ratios between 0:1–5:1. The effect of the different parameters was evaluated based on its yield amount and fuel quality. The results showed that the highest oil yield of 88.2 wt% was obtained at a temperature of 400 °C. A comparable oil yield of 88.0 wt% was also obtained at 150 min reaction time. The characterization results showed that the oil had density, viscosity and calorific value similar to the conventional gasoline. The GC–MS analysis showed that the oil was dominated by alkanes, alkenes and alcohol compounds with carbon numbers C6-C20, which is within the range of gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel. In addition, the production of oil from the liquefaction of plastic could serve as an alternative source to the depleting fuel as well as increase the value of plastics, leading to fewer environmental problems caused by plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic in a batch reactor with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product characterization via GC–MS, meeting all required criteria."
"Catalytic and thermal oxidative pyrolysis of LDPE in a continuous reactor system In this work, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic which is a mager product within plastics and formed a high amount of waste was chosen as a material to be worked.

"Syngas production through CO2-mediated pyrolysis of polyoxymethylene Plastics have become an integral part of our daily lives owing to their exceptional physicochemical properties, such as durability, low density, and cost-effectiveness, compared to traditional materials. However, the escalating production of plastics has resulted in a proportional increase in waste generation. This paper proposes environmentally benign valorization/disposal methods for plastic waste, with a particular focus on adopting a pyrolysis process that utilizes CO2 as a strategic reaction medium. As a case study, polyoxymethylene (POM), a widely used engineering plastic, was valorized through CO2-mediated pyrolysis. This study experimentally demonstrates the mechanistic effectiveness of CO2 in expediting the reaction kinetics of the thermal decomposition, specifically dehydrogenation and deoxygenation, of volatile matter derived from POM. The results revealed that employing CO2 as a reactant in the two-stage pyrolysis at 500 °C produced 30.47 mmol more syngas than under inert conditions. In conclusion, the strategic utilization of a two-stage pyrolysis process at 500 °C with CO2 as the reactant has emerged as an effective approach to the valorization of POM.

"Experimental analysis on products distribution and characterization of medical waste pyrolysis with a focus on liquid yield quantity and quality The massive generation of medical waste (MW) poses a serious risk to the natural environment and human health. The pyrolysis technique is proposed as a potential treatment for MW to tackle the associated environmental issues and produce value-added products. In this work, medical waste pyrolysis has been conducted at various temperatures using a fixed bed reactor with a 20 °C·min−1 heating rate and nitrogen was used as a career gas with a flow rate of 100 ml·min−1. In addition, the effect of temperature on products yield and chemical composition of MW pyrolysis have been investigated. The maximum yield of 57.1% for liquid oil was observed from the mixed MW pyrolysis at 500 °C. The gas and char yield were found between 26.5–37.3% and 24.2–12.4%, respectively, for the pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C to 600 °C. According to GC analysis, the concentration of the main gaseous products such as CH4, H2, and C2H4 was increased with increasing temperature, while CO and CO2 experienced a decreasing trend. The results of GC–MS analysis revealed that the main components of MW pyrolysis oil were aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohol, carboxylic acids, and their derivatives. The aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons content increased up to 38.2% at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. As pyrolysis oil tends to have more long-chain hydrocarbons therefore carbon distributions from C7 to C35 were observed. The ultimate analysis of oil and char revealed that the increased temperature enhanced the carbon content up to 78.6% and 68.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the higher heat values of 41.8, 24.4, and 52.7 MJ·kg−1 were reported for oil, char, and gas, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of medical waste (a form of plastic waste) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization of oil, gas, and char using GC–MS, TGA, and elemental analysis."
"Pyrolysis characteristics of GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic) under non-isothermal conditions The pyrolysis characteristics of GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic), which is a thermosetting plastic composed of glass fibers and polymer compounds, were determined under non-isothermal conditions while heating at 5–20°C/min from 500 to 900°C using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a batch-type pyrolyzer. The kinetic parameters for the GFRP were derived from the Freedman method with resultant activation energy ranging from 41.4kJ/mol to 78.4kJ/mol. The main components of the product gases were carbon monoxide from the ether and carbonyl decomposition of polymer and hydrogen from the aromatic ring breakage. The structural variations in the GFRP char were determined using BET, SEM, and FT-IR techniques. The surface area of GFRP char exhibited its maximum value at 600°C, decreasing at higher temperatures with the collapsing macro-pore structure. The decomposed portion of the polymers attached to the glass fiber increased when increasing the temperature from SEM image. These data are useful for understanding the GFRP pyrolysis and gasification processes.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of GFRP, a waste thermosetting plastic, with measurable yields, product composition, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization including TGA, SEM, FT-IR, and BET."
"Wheat straw/HDPE co-reaction synergy and enriched production of aromatics and light olefins via catalytic co-pyrolysis over Mn, Ni, and Zn metal modified HZSM-5 The co-reaction synergy of wheat straw (WS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic waste with varying mass ratios were evaluated at 550 °C in a fixed bed pyrolyzer reactor. Ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of WS and HDPE feed mix (3:1) at a high feed to catalyst ratio (10:1) was performed over Mn, Ni, and Zn (1, 5, and 10 wt%) metal-modified HZSM-5 at 550 °C to study the effect of metal promotors variations on the production of aromatics and light olefins. The prepared catalysts were characterized by employing XRD, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and UV-Vis analytical techniques. The results obtained in the present work indicated that 1%-Zn modified HZSM-5 produced a more relative proportion of aromatics (25.12%) in the co-pyrolysis oil organic phase, followed by 5% Ni and 5%-Zn-loaded HZSM-5 at 16.22% and 15.76% respectively. Furthermore, 5% Ni-HZSM-5 has shown higher deoxygenation ability (58.43%) in reducing the oxygenates formed, followed by 5% Mn (40.96%) and 1% Zn (35.37%) respectively. While, 5% Mn-HZSM-5 generated pyrolytic gases with higher volumetric compositions of (C2-C4) light olefins at 15.84%, followed by 1% Mn (13.97%) and 10% Ni (13.61%) respectively and these volumetric yields were strongly correlated with intermediate acidity of catalysts. The physical properties (e.g. HHV ~ 41–43 MJ/kg) of the resultant organic fraction of catalytic co-pyrolysis bio-oil are almost analogous to conventional fuels such as diesel and light fuel oil (LFO). Additionally, the resultant catalytic pyrolytic gases possessed excellent calorific value (LHV ~ 30–31 MJ/Nm3) and are comparable to natural gas. Overall, the present study has successfully demonstrated the promising nature of the catalytic co-pyrolysis process for the conversion of biomass and waste plastic into useful chemicals and fuels.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of HDPE plastic waste with wheat straw in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Production of aromatic hydrocarbons via catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and polypropylene The effects of the torrefaction of cellulose on catalytic co-pyrolysis with polypropylene (PP) over HZSM-5 and HBeta catalysts were examined in a pyrolyzer-GC/MS/TCD/FID system. Torrefied cellulose produced larger quantities of aromatic hydrocarbons during catalytic pyrolysis over both BETA and HZSM-5 catalysts than raw cellulose due to the change in crystallinity and structure of cellulose. Among the catalysts tested, HZSM-5(30) showed the highest performance for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons from the catalytic pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose. The synergy effect for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons was also observed on the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and PP over HZSM-5, even when a low catalyst to sample ratio was applied. The maximum BTEXs yield (33.4wt.%) was achieved from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied cellulose and PP at a catalyst to sample ratio of 3/1 and a torrefied cellulose to PP ratio of 1/3.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with torrefied cellulose using HZSM-5 and HBeta catalysts, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis reported."
"Production of liquid hydrocarbons from rice crop wastes mixtures by co-pyrolysis and co-hydropyrolysis The aim of this work was the valorisation of rice crop wastes mixtures by pyrolysis to produce liquids to be used as bio-fuels or as raw bio-materials. The effect of waste mixtures composition on liquids yield and composition was studied. Rice husk (RH) and straw (RS) were pyrolysed with polyethylene (PE), the main plastic used in rice production process. Polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) were also studied, due to their presence in great amounts in solid wastes. The rise of rice husk amount in PE blends led to a decrease in the conversion of co-pyrolysis (pyrolysis of blends of biomass rice and plastic wastes) and to a reduction of liquid yields. Thus, the blend with 20% (w/w) of rice wastes was selected for further studies. No great changes were observed in the results when husk was replaced by straw, which is advantageous for the pyrolysis process. However, the same was not observed for the type of plastic waste. PS decreased total conversion and the formation of gases and liquids and increased aromatic compounds content in liquids. Some tests were done using hydrogen (hydropyrolysis) instead of nitrogen (pyrolysis) with the aim of improving liquids quality due to the presence of hydrogen in the reaction medium. Different pathways were analysed: (I) co-pyrolysis; (II) co-hydropyrolysis; (III) co-pyrolysis followed by hydropyrolysis and (IV) hydropyrolysis of co-pyrolysis liquids. Co-pyrolysis followed by hydropyrolysis was not favourable for further solids conversion and led to a great increase of gases. Co-hydropyrolysis led to the highest conversion, as both gas and total liquid yields increased.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS) mixed with biomass, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of liquid products."
"Thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a novel fixed bed reactor system for the production of high value gasoline range hydrocarbons (HC) Pyrolysis is a promising thermolysis technique to recover valuable oils and light hydrocarbons (HC) with high yields from plastic solid waste (PSW). In this work, thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with the aim of producing gasoline range hydrocarbon oils, has been carried out in a novel fixed bed (batch) reactor. The pyrolysis of HDPE has been conducted between 500 to 800 °C in the presence of nitrogen as an inert carrier gas media to produce liquid fuel oil, gaseous products and solid char. The optimum temperature of obtaining maximum oil product yield (70%) was 550° C. A comprehensive gas chromatography (GC) analysis of the liquid and gaseous products was conducted to quantify high molecular weight individual HC components. Moreover, light molecular weight HC constituting the gaseous fraction were identified. A chemical kinetic analysis of the cracking reactions, was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of yielding the maximum oil product. The oil product recovered had a high proportion of aliphatic HC especially in the range of C8 to C12, whilst aromatic HC were of lower proportion. The carbon number of the pyrolysis oil was noted to increase proportionally with the increasing operating temperature. The gaseous product had a high percentage (> 70%) of C2 to C4 HC, which was attributed to the high activity of carbon/carbon (C-C) chain scission reaction.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and temperature-dependent results."
"Composition of products from the pyrolysis of polyethylene and polystyrene in a closed batch reactor: Effects of temperature and residence time The compositions of the pyrolysis products of pure low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) and their mixtures have been investigated over a temperature range from 300 to 500°C. The pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a closed batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere to study the effects of reaction temperature and residence time. LDPE was thermally degraded to oil at 425°C however, beyond this temperature the proportion of oil product decreased as a result of its conversion to char and hydrocarbon gas. Compositional analysis of the oil products showed that aliphatic hydrocarbons were the major components, but the proportion of aromatic compounds increased at higher temperatures and residence times. On the other hand, PS degraded at around 350°C, mainly into a viscous dark-coloured oil. The formation of char only increased marginally until 425°C, but was dramatically enhanced at 450 and 500°C, reaching up to 30wt.%. The oil product from PS even at 350°C consisted almost entirely of aromatic compounds especially toluene, ethylbenzene and styrene. Under increasing temperatures and residence times, the oil product from PS was preferentially converted to char, while gas formation was preferred for the oil from LDPE. For instance at 500°C, PS produced about twice the amount of char obtained from LDPE indicating the role of aromatic compounds in char formation via condensation of the aromatic ring structure. During the co-pyrolysis of a 7:3 mixture of LDPE and PS, wax product was observed at 350°C leading to oil at 400°C, indicating that the presence of PS influenced the conversion of LDPE by lowering its degradation temperature. The mixture produced more oil and less char than the individual plastics at 450°C.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and PS) in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and compositional analysis of oil, gas, and char."
"Advanced upcycling of spent electrolyte: Detoxification and selective alkene production via vacuum co-pyrolysis catalyzed by in-situ generated alkyl lithium-synergized ZSM-5 The industrial recycling of spent electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries is severely overlooked due to low economic viability, leading to significant environmental pollution and resource waste. To simultaneously achieve green and high-value-added utilization, an advanced upcycling strategy is innovatively proposed. It involves the deep detoxification and selectively directional conversion to alkene of spent electrolyte through vacuum co-pyrolysis catalyzed by in-situ generated alkyl lithium-synergized ZSM-5. The feasibility of the detoxification and selective conversion of spent electrolyte has been first validated, followed by the optimization of temperature and pressure parameters. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis reveals that the alkene yield in the pyrolysis gas can reache up to 81.16 % under the optimal conditions of 530 °C and an initial pressure of 100 Pa. Concurrently, fluorine/phosphorus/sulfur in spent electrolyte is immobilized in the form of inorganic minerals, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction of the pyrolysis residue, with the 96.30 %/97.29 %,/73.04 % detoxification rate ultimately. Based on mass spectrometry, the possible reaction mechanisms of synergistic vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis are proposed. It primarily includes the temperature-dependent regular bond cleavage of carbonates in spent electrolyte triggered by Li⁺, the deep detoxification and selective deoxidation conversion of the spent electrolyte into alkene, and the shape-selective effect resulted from steric hindrance.","The study involves lab-scale vacuum co-pyrolysis of spent electrolyte (a waste plastic-related feedstock) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including GC–MS and XRD."
"Dechlorination of fuels in pyrolysis of PVC containing plastic wastes The objective of this work is the study of several dechlorination methods devoted to reduce the chlorine content of the liquids obtained in pyrolysis of PVC containing plastic wastes. A mixture of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has been pyrolysed in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor at 500°C for 30min. Stepwise pyrolysis carried out at several temperature and time conditions, the addition of CaCO3 for chlorine capture and a combination of both methods have been studied. Additionally, some thermogravimetric analyses have been carried out in order to establish the best conditions for PVC dehydrochlorination in the presence of other plastics. It has been proved that the application of dehydrochlorination methods plays a significant role in the characteristics of pyrolysis liquids. Stepwise pyrolysis is an effective method for reduction of the chlorine content of pyrolysis liquids; additionally, heavier hydrocarbons and lower quantity of aromatics in the liquids than in conventional pyrolysis are obtained. The addition of CaCO3 leads to the retention of a significant amount of chlorine in the solid, but more chlorine than in a conventional run is found in the liquids, which contains a higher amount of aromatics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET, PVC) in a semi-batch reactor with measurable yields, temperature/time conditions, catalyst (CaCO3) performance, and product composition analysis."
"Monomer recovery from aluminium hydroxide high filled poly(methyl methacrylate) in a fluidized bed reactor The yield of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was optimized by pyrolysis of aluminium tri-hydroxide (ATH) filled poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), because an introducing experiment at a laboratory plant led to a yield of just 53% of methyl methacrylate at a temperature of 450°C instead of more than 90% feeding pure PMMA. Additional experiments with pyrolysis–GC–MS (Py–GC–MS) have shown that the reduction of the temperature to 400°C increases the yield significantly up to 75%. Further reduction of temperature led to an incomplete decomposition of the polymer. Reduced feed rate of PMMA to the half of the introducing experiment led also to a higher yield of MMA of 69%, while reduced gas residence time in the reactor had just a small effect. A final experiment at a temperature of 400°C and the half feed rate of PMMA increased the MMA-yield to 80%. The most of ATH was converted into aluminium oxide and water. Water leads to a partial saponification of MMA producing methacrylic acid (2–11wt% of organic products) and methanol (2–9wt%). The part of gas (2–8wt%) was higher than from the pyrolysis of other PMMA materials. The main components of the gas were carbon oxides.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic PMMA with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis using Py–GC–MS."
"Unravelling the structure-performance relationship of zeolite Beta in the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by proposing gasoline factor as the descriptor Plastics are widely used in daily life and industry. However, the natural degradation of waste plastics is very slow, causing considerable environmental problems. Catalytic cracking is able to convert waste plastics into fuels and chemicals, being an efficient and sustainable utilization route for waste plastics. Zeolites are commonly used as catalysts for this process, with the performance mainly affected by diffusion and acidity properties. It is necessary to elucidate the combinatorial effect of these two factors. Herein, zeolite Beta was used as the model catalyst for the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The synergistic effect of diffusion and acidity on the catalytic performance was explored by systematically controlling the Si/Al ratio (SAR) and particle size of zeolite Beta. By correlating the acidity and pore structure of Beta zeolites with the catalytic performance, a gasoline yield descriptor − gasoline factor (GF) was proposed, and GF fitted well with the gasoline yields of LDPE cracking by Beta zeolites, demonstrating that GF may provide theoretical guidance for the optimized design of zeolite catalysts in the LDPE cracking. Through fine analysis of the gasoline composition with M4 multi-dimensional chromatography, for the first time, a high proportion of cyclo-olefins was discovered in the gasoline products of all zeolite catalysts, which was ascribed to the unique long hydrocarbon chains of LDPE. Considering that cyclo-olefin copolymers possess high thermal stability and excellent chemical resistance, the cyclo-olefin monomers produced by the cracking of LDPE exhibit high potential in commercial applications.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance analysis, and experimental characterization of gasoline composition."
"Kinetic and volatile products study of micron-sized PMMA waste pyrolysis using thermogravimetry and Fourier transform infrared analysis Much attention has been devoted to disposing traditional-sized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) waste by pyrolysis for methyl methacrylate (MMA). The pyrolysis of micron-sized PMMA waste, which may be different from that of traditional-sized PMMA waste, received little concern. The present study investigated the kinetics and volatile products of micron-sized PMMA waste pyrolysis in inert atmosphere using thermogravimetry and Fourier transform infrared analysis. A global optimization algorithm namely Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) was employed to simultaneously optimize the kinetic parameters. Results indicated that one shoulder and one peak occurred in the MLR variations with temperature. The values of the MLR at the shoulder and peak, the average MLR all increased with the heating rate. The optimized kinetic parameters by SCE can be utilized to well reproduce the experimental thermogravimetric data. The values of activation energy and natural logarithm of pre-exponential factor were in the range of 235.95–248.61 kJ/mol and 16.96–28.76 min−1, respectively. The value of activation energy of micron-sized PMMA waste pyrolysis under the present study was greater than that of the traditional-sized PMMA pyrolysis in the previous studies. MMA and CO2 were the major volatile products generated from the micron-sized PMMA waste pyrolysis. The volatile products yield at peak was much larger than that at shoulder. The MMA and CO2 yield were in the range of 87.98–93.54% and 6.46–12.02%, respectively. High MMA yield may be obtained from the pyrolysis of micron-sized PMMA waste in inert atmosphere by appropriately increasing the heating rate adopted in the reactors in the practical applications.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of micron-sized PMMA waste, a commercial plastic, using thermogravimetry and FTIR analysis with measurable product yields and kinetic parameters."
"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) formation from the pyrolysis of different municipal solid waste fractions The formation of 2–4 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from the pyrolysis of nine different municipal solid waste fractions (xylan, cellulose, lignin, pectin, starch, polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) were investigated in a fixed bed furnace at 800°C. The mass distribution of pyrolysis was also reported. The results showed that PS generated the most total PAH, followed by PVC, PET, and lignin. More PAH were detected from the pyrolysis of plastics than the pyrolysis of biomass. In the biomass group, lignin generated more PAH than others. Naphthalene was the most abundant PAH, and the amount of 1-methynaphthalene and 2-methynaphthalene was also notable. Phenanthrene and fluorene were the most abundant 3-ring PAH, while benzo[a]anthracene and chrysene were notable in the tar of PS, PVC, and PET. 2-ring PAH dominated all tar samples, and varied from 40wt.% to 70wt.%. For PS, PET and lignin, PAH may be generated directly from the aromatic structure of the feedstock.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PS, PVC, PET) in a fixed-bed reactor at 800°C, reports product yields and PAH distribution, and includes experimental characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Synergistic interaction between scrap tyre and plastics for the production of sulphur-free, light oil from fast co-pyrolysis Fast co-pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution for upcycling polymer waste, including scrap tyre and plastics. Previous studies primarily focused on slow heating rates, neglecting synergistic mechanisms and sulphur transformation in co-pyrolysis with tyre. This research explored fast co-pyrolysis of scrap tyre with polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polystyrene (PS) to understand synergistic effects and sulphur transformation mechanisms. A pronounced synergy was observed between scrap tyre and plastics, with the nature of the synergy being plastic-type dependent. Remarkably, blending 75 wt% PS or LDPE with tyre effectively eliminated sulphur-bearing compounds in the liquid product. This reduction in sulphur content can substantially mitigate the release of hazardous materials into the environment, emphasizing the environmental significance of co-pyrolysis. The synergy between PP or LDPE and tyre amplified the production of lighter hydrocarbons, while PS's interaction led to the creation of monocyclic aromatics. These findings offer insights into the intricate chemistry of scrap tyre and plastic interactions and highlight the potential of co-pyrolysis in waste management. By converting potential pollutants into valuable products, this method can significantly reduce the release of hazardous materials into the environment.","The study involves lab-scale fast co-pyrolysis of scrap tyre and plastics (PP, LDPE, PS), with measurable product yields, synergy effects, and sulfur transformation analysis."
"STEP polymer degradation: Solar thermo-coupled electrochemical depolymerization of plastics to generate useful fuel plus abundant hydrogen A global goal is to call for common solutions to the challenge of environmental conservation. The cheap, clean and green energy and processes help to beat the hazardous pollution of plastics. An action of the STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process) on the polymer is to create a novel vision of the depolymerization of plastics to generate valuable fuels plus abundant hydrogen. In this paper, a solar thermo-coupled electrochemical system was first designed and employed to realize the plastics depolymerization to useful fuels for enhanced the solar utilization and the chemical polymer conversion. Exemplified by polypropylene (PP), the plastics were efficiently converted to light fuel and hydrogen via the solar-driven electrolysis coupled with pyrolysis. The results demonstrated that the depolymerization temperature was greatly lowered compared to conventional pyrolysis. The STEP conversion rates increased with a lift of the temperature and current. The high total conversion rate was significantly achieved by reaching 68.48% at 350 °C, including the solid phase of 31.52%, the liquid phase of 7.85% and the gas phase of 60.63% (w/w), which was compared to the 28.39% of the sole pyrolysis. The hydrogen was evolved during the process in the final volume of 72.5 ml, which was about 9.3 times more than that of the pyrolysis at 400 °C. In the outdoor experiments, the total conversion reached 66.64% at 350 °C, which was compared to 26.37% of the pyrolysis only. The light hydrocarbons were richly produced in the distribution of C1–C5 hydrocarbons while only tiny amounts of methane and ethane were probed in the pyrolysis. The common mechanism and pathways can be tentatively proposed in a mode of the radically initiated thermochemical reactions and electrochemical redox by the induction of the solar thermo-coupled electrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) using a solar thermo-coupled electrochemical system, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Experimental investigation of optimum bio-oil production parameters through co-pyrolysis of three organic wastes In Bangladesh, approximately 24,000 tonnes of general wastes are produced per day which creates environmental pollution due to lack of their proper disposal. Hence, a unique utilization of three types of wastes named rice husk (RH), scrap tire (ST) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using a fixed bed co-pyrolysis reactor for bio-oil extraction. Pyrolysis is selected because it produces more liquid (bio-oil) than other thermochemical treatments. The extracted bio-oil has been characterized by elemental analysis, calorific value, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography (GC-MS). During co-pyrolysis it is observed that higher process temperature produces more gaseous product and comparatively less char and liquid products (above 400 °C). In terms of a mixing ratio, higher percentage of LDPE produces more liquid and gaseous products on the contrary less amount of char product. The optimum operating conditions to produce maximum amount of bio-oil were 400 °C temperature for particle size of 1.18–2.36 mm, feed mixing ratio of 40:40:20 (ST/RH/LDPE), and running time of 120 min. The elemental analysis of the extracted bio-oil showed higher carbon and hydrogen content and lower oxygen content with a higher calorific value than that of the studied individual biomass-derived oil, leading to upgraded bio-oil. FTIR and GC-MS analysis clarifies the presence of mainly aliphatic compound in the co-pyrolytic oil. However, the number of aromatic compounds present in the co-pyrolytic oil is less than the individual biomass derived oil. The results indicated that the co-pyrolysis of ST, RH, and LDPE could be a promising way of organic waste material conversion into useful alternative fuel.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE) with biomass and tires, reporting measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product characterization via GC-MS and FTIR."
"Self-assembly kieselguhr-based ZSM-5 for catalytic pyrolysis of mask waste to produce high value-added aromatics The conversion of plastic waste to high value-added aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) through catalytic pyrolysis offers huge untapped opportunities for resource recovery and plastic pollution control. Economical equipment configuration, operation and maintenance, high safety factor, high efficiency, stability, low-cost catalyst synthesis design, high yield, high selectivity of products are the key to the practical application of catalytic pyrolysis. In present study, low-cost kieselguhr based ZSM-5 was synthesized by one-pot in situ hydrothermal method using kieselguhr as silicon-aluminum source. During the depolymerization-recrystallization process, the selective growth and self-assembly of crystals on the a, c axis formed large-grain of ZSM-5 with extended straight channels and maximized sinusoidal channels. Native transition and alkaline-earth metals were coordinated to the acidic sites of the silica-aluminum skeleton, achieving tunability of the catalyst acidity. Catalytic pyrolysis of mask waste at 550 °C in a fixed bed reactor achieved the highest pyrolysis oil yield (44.3 wt%) and BTEX selectivity (77.1 %) with p-xylene as the dominant xylene product (78.2 %). After 3 cycles of long-life experiments, the BTEX selectivity of the catalyst remained at 65.1 %, which is higher than that of commercial ZSM-5 (54.9 %), indicating the superior use stability. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the excellent shape-selectivity of the catalyst is based on its unique pore structure, which facilitates the diffusion and transport of appropriately sized intermediates/products within the structure, resulting in products with advantageous distributions. This study proposes an efficient and feasible plastic closed-loop strategy for green upgrading of medical waste to high value-added chemicals.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of mask waste (a type of plastic waste) in a fixed-bed reactor, with measured product yields, BTEX selectivity, and catalyst performance over multiple cycles."
"Investigating primary decomposition of polypropylene through detailed compositional analysis using two-dimensional gas chromatography and principal component analysis This work systematically assessed the effects of pyrolysis parameters, such as sample weight, particle size, carrier gas flow rate, and temperature, on product speciation and distribution in the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) for intrinsic kinetics. This study employed a Box-Behnken design (BBD), along with the analysis of BBD boundary conditions, as well as conditions beyond the BBD to validate the pyrolysis conditions in the primary decomposition of PP using a micropyrolyzer coupled to two-dimensional chromatography with flame ionization and time-of-flight spectrometer detectors (Py–GC × GC–FID/TOF–MS). Statistical differences and similarities in the product distribution of the experiments were determined using principal component analysis (PCA). Characteristic time analysis indicated that the sample weights employed in the study were within the isothermal kinetically controlled region, with film thickness ranging from 4.85 to 14.46 µm. The analysis of 600 pyrolysis products identified and quantified in the pyrolysis of PP for the condition combinations evaluated in BBD resulted in statistical differences at temperatures of 460, 530, and 600 oC, with C3 to C35 yields ranging from 39.88 ± 2.08 to 66.61 ± 3.26 wt%. However, no statistical differences were found in the pyrolysis product distribution within the ranges of sample weight (50 – 150 µg), particle size (53 – 125, 125 – 300, and >300 µm), and carrier gas flow rate (100 – 300 ml min-1) studied in the BBD experimental space. The analysis of the border conditions showed that a combination of the lowest carrier gas flow rate (100 ml min-1) and the highest sample weight (150 μ g) resulted in statistically different product distribution at the studied pyrolysis temperatures compared to the combination suggested by BBD. Conditions beyond the BBD, including a sample weight of 800 µg and a carrier gas flow rate of 30 ml min-1, resulted in statistically different product distributions compared to the BBD. Notably, new products such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified. The findings from this work clearly show the importance of selecting appropriate pyrolysis parameters to obtain kinetically relevant experimental data, which in turn serves as a valuable guide for the development and validation of (micro-) kinetic models.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene using a micropyrolyzer with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization."
"Co-pyrolysis of Baltic wheat straw and low-density polyethylene bags and its kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour Wheat cultivation represents about 42 % of the total cereal cultivation area in the Baltic Sea region, generating huge amounts of wheat straw (WS) that needs to be optimally managed. In this context, this research aims to investigate the extent of using pyrolysis process in WS valorization. The experiments were performed using a thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer on WS and its mixtures with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags at different mixing ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4). The released TG vapours were monitored using TG-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The thermochemical activation energy (Ea) were studied by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Friedman, and Vyazovkin models. The pyrolysis results showed that WS and LDPE could be completely decomposed as a single reaction up to 600 °C and 520 °C, respectively. Aromatic-carbonyl and CO2 were the main FTIR functional group for WS vapour versus -CH2- for LEDP vapour. The GC/MS analysis of WS showed various compounds such as sec-Butylamine (11.88 %), acetic acid (10.68 %), etc., while LDPE showed many compounds without specific trend even when the heating rate was changed. While the co-pyrolysis results showed that WS/LDPE could be decomposed individually in two successive reactions at 335 °C (WS) and 495 °C (LDPE). These results were confirmed by FTIR and GC/MS which showed that the functional groups and chemical compounds of vapour generated at these decomposition zones have similar characteristics to those obtained from pyrolysis of WS and LDPE. Finally, kinetic analysis showed that WS-Baltic (227–250 kJ/mol) is more complex compared to WS-Asian (163–217 kJ/mol) due to its higher ash content. While Ea of WS/LDPE was increases upto 274–291 kJ/mol (1:1), 266–297 kJ/mol (2:1), 268–289 kJ/mol (3:1), and 278–299 kJ/mol (1:4). Also, the enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy coefficients of WS were increased by mixing (1:1) up to 272 J/mol K, while its entropy does not change much by mixing (367 J/mol K). Accordingly, the co-pyrolysis process is a key technology in valorization of WS and convert into value-added chemicals and a sustainable energy source.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags mixed with wheat straw, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization using TG-FTIR and GC-MS."
"Double-edged effects of polyvinyl chloride addition on heavy metal separation and biochar production during pyrolysis of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator Pyrolysis is a promising technique to achieve the sustainable utilization of heavy metal hyperaccumulator derived from phytoremediation of contaminated soils. To investigate the feasibility of synergistic treatment of hyperaccumulator and plastic waste (i.e. polyvinyl chloride, PVC), co-pyrolysis of Sedum alfredii and different mass percentages of PVC (5–25 wt%) was conducted at 300–900 °C in the present study. High pyrolysis temperature and low PVC addition amount (5 wt%) effectively promoted the volatilization of Cd and Zn from S. alfredii, while high PVC addition amount (15 wt% and 25 wt%) caused a significant suppression effect at insufficient pyrolysis temperatures. After PVC addition, the yields of biochar increased by 5.18–37.19% as compared with the theoretical values. However, the concentrations of Cd and Zn leached from biochar significantly elevated with increasing PVC addition amount, indicating that the addition of PVC improved the mobility of Cd and Zn in biochar. Moreover, S. alfredii derived biochars showed considerable sorption capacity for Cd (87.6–198.3 mg/g). These results imply that the addition of PVC has double-edged effects on heavy metal separation and biochar production during pyrolysis of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator, and low PVC addition amount and sufficient pyrolysis temperature are beneficial for the further utilization of biochar.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) mixed with a hyperaccumulator plant, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of biochar and metal leaching."
"Copyrolysis of naphtha with polyalkene cracking products; the influence of polyalkene mixtures composition on product distribution The steam cracking (copyrolysis) of naphtha with oils/waxes from thermal decomposition of polyalkenes has been investigated as a process for chemical recycling of plastic wastes. High-density polyethylene (HDPE), two-component mixture (LDPE/PP) and three-component mixture (HDPE/LDPE/PP) were thermally decomposed in a batch reactor at 450°C, thus forming oil/wax products. Subsequently, these products were dissolved in heavy naphtha in the amount of 10 mass% to obtain steam cracking feedstock. The composition of gaseous and liquid products during copyrolysis was studied at 780°C and 820°C in dependence on residence time from 0.08s to 0.51s. The obtained results were compared with the product composition from steam cracking of naphtha at identical experimental conditions. The decomposition of polyalkene oils/waxes during copyrolysis was confirmed on the basis of analysis of liquid products. It was shown that more ethene and propene was formed during copyrolysis of oil/wax from HDPE in comparison with naphtha and both mixtures and so oil/wax from HDPE seems to be favourable component of steam cracking feedstock. There were slight differences between product compositions from copyrolysis of two- and three-component mixtures. The presence of HDPE in three-component mixture supported formation of gas and ethene. The presence of oil/wax form PP enhanced formation of propene and branched alkenes. For both type of polyalkenic mixtures the yields of desired low molecular alkenes and alkanes were higher or approximately the same as from naphtha. The results confirm suitability of oils/waxes from polyalkenes as a co-feed for steam cracking units.","The study involves thermal decomposition of waste polyalkenes (HDPE, LDPE, PP) in a batch reactor, followed by analysis of product yields and composition during steam cracking, demonstrating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"Thermochemical conversion of mixed plastics from car dismantling by pyrolysis and distillation and potential applications of the products The complete disposal of waste plastics (WPs) is a serious challenge in today’s world. One of their streams originates in growing number of end-of-life vehicles, where these materials are often mixed, and their mechanical recycling is practically impossible. However, their complete neutralization can be achieved by the process of thermochemical conversion. The obtained pyrolytic oil can enter into the supply chain after the cracking process in the petrochemical industry. The paper draws attention to the prospects of using various fractions obtained after distillation of oil from the pyrolysis process of mixed waste plastics from end-of-life cars, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), which are currently difficult to process in a traditional way. Four types of waste were tested: polyolefin waste (POW) in the form of a 1:1 PE:PP blend, ABS and POW-ABS blends in the ratios of 4:1 and 3:2. Their physicochemical properties were investigated and thermogravimetric analyses (TG/DTG/DSC) coupled with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were performed. As a result of pyrolysis, a broad hydrocarbon fraction (BHF) was isolated, which was subjected to atmospheric distillation leading to wax, naphtha and gasoline fractions. Their properties were determined and some applications indicated. Mixing polyolefin waste with ABS in a 4:1 ratio in the pyrolysis process increased the yield of liquid products (BHF) by approximately 18 % and reduced the amount of pyrolysis gas by approximately 64 % compared to the amount from POW pyrolysis; in the case of a 3:2 ratio, the effects were much smaller – 4 % and 25 %, respectively. Moreover, naphtha fractions were mixed in various proportions with diesel oil to determine the possibility of using it as an additive to diesel fuel. The mixture in the proportions of 20 % POW-ABS 4:1 naphtha fraction + 80 % diesel oil is characterized by properties most similar to standard diesel oil, and meets the PN-EN 590:2022–08 standard. The obtained results show the reasonability of thermochemical conversion of plastic waste containing ABS + PE/PP and indicate the applications of its products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PE, PP, ABS) with measurable product yields, catalyst-free reactor operation, and analytical characterization including TG/DTG/DSC and FTIR, yielding quantifiable results such as BHF yield increases and fuel blend properties."
"Tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading of plastic waste towards kerosene-range products using Si-pillared vermiculite with transition metal modification The transformation of waste plastics to fuel products is an appealing strategy to address plastic-associated environmental and energy issues. In this study, a tandem pyrolysis–catalytic upgrading approach, using a series of mono-/bitransition-metal-modified Si-pillared vermiculite catalysts, was adopted to transform disposable grocery bags (i.e., a polyethylene-based material) to kerosene-range fuels. The results revealed that the silicon pillars contributed to the catalyst’s excellent thermal stability to withstand temperatures of up to 1000 °C, while the transition-metallic species (e.g., Co/Ni/Fe) contributed to the fine-tuning of the catalyst’s acidity and porosity. Specifically, Co–Fe/Si-pillared vermiculite (SPV) (5:5) produced the highest yield of oil products (75.7 wt%), with alkane and aromatic selectivities of 57.5% and 27.8%, respectively, resembling the composition of kerosene. The catalyst’s high selectivities for the targeted products were attributed to the controllable acidity and porosity, enabling a balance to be achieved between these two properties. Pathways were proposed for the tandem pyrolysis in the presence of Co–Fe/SPV. The vermiculite-based catalysts showed satisfactory reusability following regeneration. Beyond polyethylene-based plastics, these catalysts are also applicable to the pyrolysis of other plastic feedstocks. Because vermiculite is a low-cost material, the developed catalyst has good commercialization potential for a wide spectrum of waste-to-energy conversions.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyethylene-based waste plastic with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Carbon black recovery from waste tire pyrolysis by demineralization: Production and application in rubber compounding Pyrolysis offers the possibility to convert waste tires into liquid and gaseous fractions as well as a carbon-rich solid (CBp), which contains the original carbon black (CB) and the inorganic compounds used in tire manufacture. Whilst both liquid and gaseous fractions can be valorized without further processing, there is a general consensus that CBp needs to be improved before it can be considered a commercial product, seriously penalizing the pyrolysis process profitability. In this work, the CBp produced in a continuous pyrolysis process was demineralized (chemical leaching) with the aim of recovering the CB trapped into the CBp and thus, producing a standardized CB product for commercial purposes. The demineralization process was conducted by using cheap and common reagents (HCl and NaOH). In this sense, the acid treatment removed most of the mineral matter contained in the CBp and concentration was the main parameter controlling the demineralization process. An ash content of 4.9 wt% was obtained by using 60 min of soaking time, 60 °C of temperature, 10 mL/g of reagent/CBp ratio and HCl 4 M. The demineralized CBp (dCBp) showed a carbon content of 92.9 wt%, while the FRX analysis indicated that SiO2 is the major component into the ash. The BET surface area was 76.3 m2/g, and textural characterizations (SEM/EDX and TEM) revealed that dCBp is composed by primary particles lower than 100 nm. Although dCBp showed a low structure, the surface chemistry was rich in surface acidic groups. Finally, dCBp was used in Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) compounding, probing its technical feasibility as substitute of commercial CB N550.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic-containing waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst-free demineralization, and detailed characterization of the resulting carbon black product."
"Microwave-assisted upcycling of plastic waste to high-performance carbon anode for lithium-ion batteries The increasing demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has emphasized the need for affordable and sustainable materials, prompting the exploration of waste upcycling to address global sustainability challenges. In this study, we efficiently converted polypropylene (PP) plastic waste from used centrifuge tubes into activated polypropylene carbon (APC) using microwave-assisted pyrolysis. The synthesis of APC was optimized using response surface methodology/central composite design (RSM/CCD). Based on the RSM results, the optimal conditions for PP plastic conversion into carbon were determined as follows: HNO3 concentration of 3.5 M, microwave temperature of 230 °C, and holding time of 25 min. Under these conditions, the obtained intensity ratio of Id/Ig in PP carbon was 0.681 ± 0.013, with an error of 6.81 ± 0.013 % between predicted and actual values. The physicochemical studies, including FESEM-EDX, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy, confirmed the successful synthesis of APC samples. The APC 800 material exhibited a well-organized three-dimensional structure characterized by large pores and mesopores, enabling fast ion transport in the electrode. As a result, the APC 800 electrode demonstrated an initial discharge capacity of 381.0 mAh/g, an improved initial coulombic efficiency of 85.1%, and excellent cycling stability after 100 cycles. Notably, the APC 800 electrode displayed remarkable rate performance, showing a reversible capacity of 355.1 mAh/g when the current density was reset to 0.2 A/g, highlighting its high electrochemical reversibility. The outstanding characteristics of APC 800 as an anode electrode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries suggest a promising future for its application in the field.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) plastic waste, with measurable experimental conditions, product yields, and physicochemical characterization of the resulting carbon anode material."
"Enhanced aromatics production via co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic by Zn modified ZSM-5 catalysts The co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic with Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts were studied to improve the aromatic production. The Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method and characterized by BET, XRD, NH3-TPD and SEM methods. The effects of Si/Al ratios of ZSM-5, Zn loadings, catalytic temperatures, and mass ratios of feedstock-to-catalyst on the selectivity and composition of aromatics in the liquid products were investigated. It was found that under the optimal conditions of 5 % Zn loading, Si/Al ratio of ZSM-5 of 120, catalytic temperature of 500 ℃, and mass ratio of feedstock-to-catalyst of 1/2, the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics hydrocarbons (MAHs) can reach 86.02 %, and the selectivity of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) can reach 59.10 %. Furthermore, the stability experiments demonstrated that the 5 % Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst maintained the aromatic selectivity of MAHs above 85 % after 10 cycles. The mechanism of co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic with Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts was also proposed, which indicates that the Zn/ZSM-5 catalyst promoted the formation of aromatics via Diels-Alder and dehydration reactions between furan derived from biomass pyrolysis and alkenes produced from plastic pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic and biomass with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis using experimental methods."
"Catalytic degradation of polyethylene using nanosized ZSM-2 zeolite Nanosized ZSM-2 zeolite with crystal size of ∼100nm was synthesized and ion exchanged in order to characterize its behaviour in the catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) in a semi-batch reactor. The starting ZSM-2 allowed a reduction in the PE degradation temperature of more than 80°C as quantified by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). By either proton or Lanthanum exchanges, the nanozeolite increased the acidity improving even more these degradation processes. The starting nanometric catalyst was dramatically more active than a micrometric Y-zeolite displaying lower onset temperatures of PE degradation due to its higher external surface area. These differences nevertheless were reduced by ion-exchanging the Y-catalysts. Our results confirm the relevance of both the zeolite acidity and other parameters, such as crystal size and crystallinity of the zeolite framework, on the catalytic efficiency. Regarding the degradation products during the catalytic process, both zeolites increased the production of low boiling compounds being more efficient the ZSM-2 based catalysts reaching a yield about 90%. Higher amount of accessible sites active for cracking on the external surface of the nanosized crystals would be responsible of this high gas yield. Furthermore, ZSM-2-based zeolites were highly selective to propylene and C4 compounds compared with Y-based zeolites. These results open up the use of nanosized ZSM-2 zeolites in the catalytic degradation of PE with relevant energetic applications.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene using nanosized ZSM-2 zeolite, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalytic performance data."
"Polyethylene upcycling to aromatics by pulse pressurized catalytic pyrolysis To address the challenging issues of waste plastic pollution and petroleum shortage, we report herein a pulse pressurized catalytic pyrolysis process where polyethylene is continuously converted into aromatics using HZSM-5 catalyst incorporated with hydrated SiO2. Pressurization improves the activity of single-pulse pyrolysis of polyethylene by 14.42%. In contrast to the linear decrease of BTEXS relative yield with a K value of − 0.23 under non-pressurized conditions, pressurization results in a notable stability in the latter stage, characterized by a K value of only − 0.063. Comprehensive catalyst characterization demonstrates that pressurization promotes the release of water from hydrated SiO2, enabling HZSM-5 to effectively undergo dealumination and obtain suitable acidity and pore structure, and ultimately enhancing the resistance to carbon deposition. In summary, pressurization improves both pyrolysis activity and catalysis stability, offering a promising strategy for the high-value utilization of waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under defined reactor conditions."
"Microcrystalline paraffin wax, biogas, carbon particles and aluminum recovery from metallised food packaging plastics using pyrolysis, mechanical and chemical treatments Metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW) is the most complex part of plastic waste ever with poor recyclability. In order to close the circle loop of MFPWs and to increase their economic and environmental benefits according to the zero waste principle, this research aims to convert MFPWs into energy products (Microcrystalline paraffin wax and biogas) and raw materials (carbon particles and aluminum) using three combined approaches: pyrolysis, mechanical and chemical treatments. The thermal treatment using mini-pyrolysis plant (capacity of 250 g) was applied as the main treatment to convert MFPWs into three main energy products: biooil, biogas, and char mixed with aluminum flakes (Al/char) at 25 °C/min up to 500, 600, and 700 °C, while the mechanical treatment using milling process was used to break the bonds between char and Al flakes, thus liberating Al flakes after sieving process. Finally, the leaching process using hydrochloric acid was employed to extract the remaining Al particles from the milled Al/char and to recover the carbon particles simultaneously, using a density separation method. The experiments were performed on a mixture of five types of equal shares of packages (potato chips, chocolate, bakery, coffee, and biscuits). The obtained energy products and recovered materials were analyzed by GC, FTIR, ICP, and SEM-EDS. The results showed that MFPWs can be decomposed thermally into Al/char (99.4%) only up to 500 °C, while in case of 600 and 700 °C, they can be converted into microcrystalline paraffin wax (19.5%), biogas (63%), and Al/char (17.8%). Also, the mechanical and chemical treatments were succeeded by leaching >90 wt% of Al and extraction of carbon particles on a micro-scale (10–50 μm). Finally, the assessment of economic performance and greenhouse gases showed that application of the developed approach on an industrial scale can provide an economic return up to 610 $/ton of MFPWs and decrease carbon footprint by −984 kg CO2-eq/t of MFPWs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (metallised food packaging) with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Tailoring Fe2O3–Al2O3 catalyst structure and activity via hydrothermal synthesis for carbon nanotubes and hydrogen production from polyolefin plastics Fe2O3–Al2O3 catalysts applied for conversion of polyolefin plastic waste into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and H2 are typically produced by impregnation, co-precipitation or sol-gel synthesis at atmospheric pressure and temperatures below 100 °C. This study utilized hydrothermal conditions and established the role of precipitating agents (urea, N-methylurea and N,N′-dimethylurea) on properties and catalytic activity of Fe2O3–Al2O3 catalysts (Fe-u, Fe-mu and Fe-dmu, respectively). The precipitating agent played a key role in tailoring the properties, such as crystallization degree, surface area and reducibility. The precipitating agents influenced the yield and outer diameters of MWCNTs but did not affect graphitization degree. Among the synthesized catalysts, Fe-u had the largest surface area and preferential formation of the highly reducible α-Fe2O3 crystalline phase. As a result, Fe-u had the highest activity during conversion of pyrolysis gas from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into MWCNTs, yielding 0.91 g·g−1-catalyst MWCNTs at 800 °C as compared to 0.42 and 0.14 g·g−1-catalyst using Fe-dmu and Fe-mu, respectively. Fe-dmu favored the growth of MWCNTs with smaller outer diameters. Fe-u demonstrated high efficiency during operation using a continuous flow of pyrolysis gas from a mixture of polyolefins (70 wt% polypropylene, 6 wt% LDPE and 24 wt% high density polyethylene) producing 4.28 g·g−1-catalyst MWCNTs at 3.2% plastic conversion efficiency and a stable H2 flow for 155 min (25–32 vol%). The obtained data demonstrate that the selection of an appropriate precipitating agent for hydrothermal synthesis allows for the production of highly active Fe2O3–Al2O3 catalysts for the upcycling of polyolefin plastic waste into MWCNTs and H2.","The study involves pyrolysis of polyolefin plastic waste (LDPE, PP, HDPE) in a lab-scale reactor, with measurable yields of MWCNTs and H2, catalyst performance data, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Microwave co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins and waste cooking oil: Influence of N2 atmosphere versus vacuum environment Microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) of waste cooking oil (WCO) and waste polyolefins (WP) was examined for its potential to convert these wastes into liquid fuel. The influence of performing the pyrolysis process under N2 atmosphere and vacuum environment was investigated with emphasis on the temperature profile, heating rate, and the yield and properties of the liquid oil obtained. Different ratios of WP to WCO (1:2, 1:1.5, 1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1) were also investigated. MCP performed under vacuum environment recorded higher heating rates (20–24 °C/min) and higher yield of liquid oil (up to 62 wt.%) compared to that performed under N2 atmosphere (18–22 °C/min of heating rate and 24–50 wt.% of liquid oil). The high heating rate resulted in shorter reaction time and lower power consumption, leading to lower energy consumption by the pyrolysis process. The liquid oil comprised C13–C24 hydrocarbons (aliphatics, aromatics) within the hydrocarbon range of diesel fuel. It also showed promising green properties comprising low nitrogen and oxygen content, and free of sulphur. Combined with the detection of high energy content (42–49 MJ/kg) and low moisture content (<1 wt.%), the liquid oil shows great potential to be used as a fuel. Our results show that MCP performed under vacuum environment shows potential as a promising pyrolysis approach with improved heating performance and production of hydrocarbon fuel with desirable fuel properties.","The study involves lab-scale microwave co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefins and waste cooking oil, with measurable yields, temperature profiles, heating rates, and product composition analysis."
"Fast pyrolysis of fibre waste contaminated with plastic for use as fuel products Pyrolysis is finding increasing application as a tool for the effective management of industrial waste, as it can process a wide variety of heterogeneous feedstock into energy dense products. Inductively heated fast pyrolysis with heating rate of 250 °C min−1 was applied for conversion of three industrial waste streams from a fibre recycling mill, contaminated with plastic wastes, into energy products. Experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (350, 450 and 550 °C) and the yields and energy contents of the char, oil, wax and gas products were determined. For all three waste streams, conversion at 350 °C, mostly concentrated the energy in the char, resulting in calorific values between 20.9 MJ kg−1 and 35.1 MJ kg−1 which are comparable to common bituminous coal used for power generation. Pyrolysis at 450 or 550 °C promoted the formation of condensable volatiles (wax/liquid) with total wax yields of up to 54 wt.% being obtained at 550 °C, with the calorific value up to 41.7 MJ kg−1 comparable to heavy fuel oil. The estimated net energy yield for the three waste streams ranged from 10 to 25 MJ (kg dry feedstock)−1 with the largest energy yield being obtained for the stream containing the largest fraction of hydrocarbon plastics.","The study involves lab-scale fast pyrolysis of plastic-contaminated fibre waste, reports measurable product yields and calorific values at specific temperatures, and includes experimental characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Preparation of high quality carbon nanotubes by catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using FeNi-based catalyst Plastic waste pollution is the serious environmental problem, and catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics is an effective way to solve this problem. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are prepared by catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste plastics by one-stage method using iron nitrate and nickel nitrate as catalyst. The growth mechanism of CNTs is analyzed in detail. TPO, XRD, SEM and Raman analyses show that increasing Ni content contributes to the production of CNTs with good morphology and high graphitization degree. While the increasing Fe content contributes to improving the yield of CNTs. The outer and inner diameters of the FeNi12-CNTs-800 are about 21 nm and 8 nm with the length of 18.9 μm, respectively. LDPE pyrolysis gases are analyzed to determine that the primary carbon source required for CNTs growth is C2H4. The C2H4 adsorption and decomposition processes on FeNi alloys are performed to reveal the growth mechanism of CNTs, based on density functional theory calculation. Three kinds of the growth models are proposed to explain the difference of the CNTs tubular shape. FeNi12-CNTs-800 are used to remove microplastics from wastewater due to existence of magnetic. PVC can be quickly removed from wastewater with removal of 100 % at 20 min. This study provides an effective way for recycling and treatment of waste plastic.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization (TPO, XRD, SEM, Raman)."
"Performance analysis and production of aromatics for ex situ catalytic pyrolysis of engineered WEEE Ex situ catalytic pyrolysis of engineered waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was conducted in a two-stage reactor using HZSM-5 catalyst. The effect of the catalysis temperature and the catalyst-to-feedstock (C/F) ratio on products yield, gas and oil composition, and products characterization were investigated in this study. Results indicated that lower reforming temperature and C/F ratio favored organic fractions production. The highest yield of organic fraction was obtained at a catalysis temperature of 450 °C and at a C/F ratio of 0.15, corresponding to 28.5 and 27.4 wt %, respectively. The highest selectivity toward aromatic hydrocarbons and the lowest TAN value of the organic fraction were obtained at a catalysis temperature of 450 °C and a C/F ratio of 0.2, respectively. Most of the alkali and transition metals and 23 % of Br remained in the solid residue after the catalytic pyrolysis of low-grade electronic waste (LGEW).","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), a type of plastic waste, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Synthesis and characterization of the porous activated carbon from end-of-life tire pyrolysis for CO2 sequestration This research aims to synthesize and characterize the CO2 adsor+bent from waste tire (WT) as a precursor to produce porous carbon adsorbent material using a combination of thermal (pyrolysis, 600–700 °C) and chemical (H3PO4 and KOH) methods. The derived fine black powder was impregnated by 10–50 wt% polyethyleneimine (PEI) to produce porous carbon material (PEI-PCM) for evaluation of the performance of CO2 adsorption under TGA (micro-scale system). To observe the PEI loading and relevant CO2 capture selectivity characteristics, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) were carried out. The XRD pattern showed the main phase of amorphous carbon, graphite, and some impurities (ZnS). Type II adsorption isotherm is related with reducing of the specific surface area and pore volume from 78 m2·g−1 to 25.26 m2·g−1, 0.45 cm3·g−1 to 0.23 cm3·g−1, respectively. The FT-IR spectra indicated the bending of primary and secondary amine which belonged to PEI molecule. It can be concluded that PEI-PCM properties such as, pore-size distribution, pore volume and surface functional groups supported CO2 adsorption capability following surface structure modification. The 50 wt% PEI-PCM-P showed good adsorption capacity of 53.81 mg·g−1 at temperatures of 75 °C. As a result, the PEI-PCM was successfully developed for CO2 absorption application. This work can help mitigating the challenge of disposal of WT and realization of the bio-circular-green economy (BCG model).","The study involves pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic-containing waste, under controlled laboratory conditions with measurable product yields and analytical characterization of the resulting materials."
"Pyrolysis characteristics of excavated waste and generation mechanism of gas products The mining of landfills provides an important opportunity for waste resource recovery, and the excavated waste with potential useable value has attracted widely attention. In this work, the pyrolysis technique was used to analyze the properties of excavated waste, including the thermal characteristics and kinetics analysis, the distribution of pyrolysis products and the composition of pyrolysis gas. The pyrolysis of excavated waste was performed in a lab-scale reactor in the temperature range of 500–900 °C. The results show that the pyrolysis activation energy of wood and textile was lower than that of plastics and rubber, and it was easier for the pyrolysis reaction to proceed. With the increase of temperature, the pyrolysis gas yield increased and the tar showed a decreasing trend. The plastic has the highest yield of tar with 74.9% and the textile has the highest yield of gas with 61.8% at 900 °C. Wood and rubber tend to produce high yield char with 28.5% and 40.6%, respectively. The pyrolysis gas composition was determined by Micro GC, and the release pattern during pyrolysis was also monitored. High temperature favors the production of H2/CO, and hinders the CO2/CH4. Plastics and rubber were more likely to produce C2∼C3 gases than wood and textiles. In addition, the pyrolysis properties of excavated waste and raw waste was compared.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of excavated waste containing plastics, with measured product yields, temperature-dependent gas and tar distributions, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis gas using Micro GC."
"Performance of a continuous screw kiln reactor for the thermal and catalytic conversion of polyethylene–lubricating oil base mixtures Both thermal and catalytic cracking of mixtures consisting of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and a lubricating oil base have been investigated in a continuous screw kiln reactor, provided with two reaction zones operating at different temperatures (T 1/T 2). The incorporation of the lubricating oil into the plastic leads to a significant decrease in its viscosity which favors the mixture flow through the reactor. Thermal cracking at 450/500°C of LDPE–lubricating oil base mixtures with compositions ranging from 40/60–70/30 (%, w/w) led in all cases to their almost complete conversion (∼90%) towards a broad spectrum of C1–C40 hydrocarbons. Catalytic cracking of a 70/30 (%, w/w) LDPE–lubricating oil base mixture over mesoporous Al-MCM-41 catalysts at 400/450°C proceeded with lower activity with regards to the pure LDPE catalytic cracking. This result is related to both the lower reactivity of the oil compared to the pure polyolefin and to the poisoning of the catalyst acid sites by sulfur/nitrogen-containing compounds present in the lubricant oil base. However, at higher temperatures (450/500°C), complete conversion of the mixture was attained over both Al-MCM-41 and nanocrystalline HZSM-5 (n-HZSM-5) catalysts. Al-MCM-41 materials leads mainly to C5–C12 products (65% selectivity) whereas lighter hydrocarbons were formed preferentially over n-HZSM-5 (63% selectivity towards C3–C5 compounds). These results demonstrate that the screw kiln reactor is an efficient system for the continuous processing of plastic–lubricant oil mixtures by thermal and catalytic treatments.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polyethylene mixed with lubricating oil base in a continuous screw kiln reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Effect of the temperature in the nature and extension of the primary and secondary reactions in the thermal and HZSM-5 catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes is a promising recycling alternative to the disposal methods currently used for this type of residues (i.e. land filling or energetic valorisation). In order to optimize the yields of compounds obtained with this treatment, the knowledge of the parameters’ influence on the degradation process is of great interest. Pyrolysis temperature and volatiles residence time are the most influential variables in the process, since they affect the primary as well as the secondary reactions. In this work, the pyrolysis temperature effect on the primary and secondary reactions of the thermal and HZSM-5 catalyzed pyrolysis of HDPE is reported and evaluated, in the range 500–800°C. For this purpose, two different equipments have been used, i.e. a flash coil pyrolyzer (pyroprobe 1000), that allows us to study the primary products, since the extent of secondary reactions can be neglected, and a fluidized bed reactor, where the extent of the secondary reactions is significant. The results of the present study show that 1-hexene is the major product obtained when primary thermal cracking reactions are mainly taking place. However, the major compounds obtained when thermal secondary reactions are present in larger extension are propene at low temperatures and ethene at high temperatures. In catalytic pyrolysis, the effect of HZSM-5 is clearly evident at all temperatures evaluated, increasing the volatile yields in both equipments used. The influence of this catalyst is more significant in the primary cracking reactions showing an increase of the volatile compounds with the degradation temperature. In this case, propene is the main volatile product obtained reaching a yield of 30.6% at the highest temperature evaluated. When the presence of the secondary reactions is evident, using a fluidized bed reactor, the combined effect of generation and possible cracking reactions leads to a low-dependent product distribution on the degradation temperature, propene being the main volatile compound in the range of temperatures studied. It has been observed that branched hydrocarbons are formed mainly from secondary reactions and are quickly destroyed by increasing the temperature. In the zeolite catalyzed pyrolysis the differences between the yields obtained in both equipments are lower than in the thermal case.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE using flash coil and fluidized bed reactors, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"The effect of PVC on thermal and catalytic degradation of polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene by a continuous flow reactor A continuous flow reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure and feed rate of 0–1.5kgh−1 for degradation of PE, PP and PS in presence of 1–2wt% PVC. The degradation temperatures were between 360 and 440°C depending on the feeding material. The influence of PVC, temperature and silica-alumina catalysts on degradation behavior and on the properties of the products was studied and discussed. Different effects were observed for binary PE/PVC, PP/PVC, PS/PVC and complex PE/PP/PS/PVC mixtures due to specific interactions between PVC and each hydrocarbon polyolefin. Silica-alumina catalysts decreased the Cl concentration in oils but it seems to generate high amounts of Cl-containing organic compounds in gases.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC) in a continuous flow reactor with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Tandem catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic packaging wastes to produce BTEX over dual catalysts The ubiquitous challenges caused by the accumulation of mismanaged plastic solid wastes have seriously endangered ecological health. For enhancing the sustainable and environment-friendly conversion of mixed plastic packaging wastes into high-value benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) while effectively reducing the coke deposition on catalysts, tandem catalytic pyrolysis of mixed packaging plastics over dual catalysts (MCM-41 and HZSM-5) was explored via a combination of in-situ catalysis and ex-situ catalysis in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. The selectivity of total and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was nearly 100% and 85% with MCM-41 (500 °C) followed by HZSM-5 (550 °C), respectively. The BTEX production (245.33 mg/g) was considerably improved as compared to ex-situ catalysis of HZSM-5 (185.30 mg/g) and MCM-41/HZSM-5 (209.14 mg/g). Moreover, the total coke amount of tandem catalysis decreased to 14.25 mg/g than that of ex-situ catalysis of HZSM-5 (30.72 mg/g). The mechanisms analysis revealed that the pre-reforming effect of MCM-41 suppressed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formation and coke deposition on the following HZSM-5 and meanwhile improved the utilization of internal acid sites for obtaining high-yield BTEX.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of mixed plastic packaging wastes with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Production of valuable hydrocarbons by catalytic degradation of a mixture of post-consumer plastic waste in a fluidized-bed reactor A mixture of post-consumer plastic waste (PE/PP/PS/PVC) was pyrolyzed over various catalysts using a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process operating isothermally at ambient pressure. Experiments with various catalysts gave good yields of valuable hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions. A model based on kinetic and mechanistic schemes for the observed products associated with chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation has been developed. The model gives a good representation of experimental results. It is also an improvement on the currently available empirical “lumping” techniques which are usually severely restricted in terms of product definitions. Additionally, this model represents the benefits of product selectivity for the chemical composition in relation to the effect of structurally different catalyst types, and the performance of the reaction temperature used as well as the particle size of the catalyst selected.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste (PE/PP/PS/PVC) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data.
"Chemical characterization of liquid products from the pyrolysis of plastic wastes Industrial plastic wastes (PE and PP) were pyrolysed in a novel industrial prototype, with and without a zeolite catalyst, in the range 390–430 °C. Notably, the operating temperature range was set after preliminary characterization of the feedstock by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis tests in a lab scale reactor. The liquid products collected from the prototype unit looked like oil and were collected in cooled traps. These oils were characterized for their chemical composition and their potential application and commerciality. TGA of the oils was carried out as a preliminary screening, providing indication on the volatility ranges of the sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to provide a more detailed indication on the chemical composition of the samples, in particular on the content and length of alkanes and alkenes as well as on the presence of trace compounds. Notably, prior to GC-MS analysis, the sample had to be dissolved in an organic solvent and dichloromethane (DCM) was selected as the best solvent, after an accurate screening process. Both the TGA and the chromatographic analysis of the samples highlighted a good quality of the pyrolysis liquid products obtained at 390 °C, with modest effects of the catalyst, despite, unfortunately, rather low yields. On the contrary, the quality of the products obtained at 430 °C was lower, but the yields adequate (about 70 %). The analysis of the condensed liquids produced has also shown that the effects of the catalyst at 430 °C appear not to be negligible. Indeed, it can be observed that the catalyst causes a decrease in the concentration of aliphatic hydrocarbons with a number of C atoms greater than 25, but favors dehydrogenation, increasing alkenes concentration. These two factors are contrasting, therefore it cannot be considered that the catalyst improves the quality of the liquid products, making them more similar to a typical diesel oil. In order to test the commercial applications for the pyrolysis oils, additional analyses were conducted in independent labs, showing that, through mild chemico-physical treatments, the oil produced at 390 °C with catalyst is suitable as additive (20 %) for diesel fuel, while the lower-quality oils, as produced, can be mixed with heavy fuel oil (up to very high percentage) or with diesel oils in amounts as high as 5 %.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE and PP) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis via GC-MS, and reactor condition data, all indicating experimental validation."
"Transportation fuel from plastic wastes: Production, purification and SI engine tests Thermal pyrolysis of HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET and PUR plastic wastes were performed in a batch reactor equipped with a temperature controlled reflux and the yields of pyrolysis oils and liquid fuels suitable for transportation were determined. The gasoline fractions were investigated by GC-MS and tested in a traditional spark-ignition engine without any modifications or fuel blending. Fuel consumption and exhaust gas emission (NOx, CO) were measured and compared to a commercial fuel (gasoline, RON = 95). PS generated 70.5% gasoline range hydrocarbons from the solid waste, followed by PP with 42.1%, LDPE with 40.8% and HDPE with 37.3%. Liquid product was not observed during PET pyrolysis. The engine was easily running with neat gasoline fractions obtained from HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS distillation; however, it was not able to start the engine with the neat dehydrated PUR distillate. The volumetric fuel consumption was reduced by 9.1–9.4% in case of PS compared to commercial gasoline (RON = 95) but the NOx emission was increased by 82–147%. Fuel consumption reduction was noticeable at HDPE, LDPE and PP as well. PS gasoline decreased by 91–96%, while HDPE, LDPE and PP more likely increased the CO emission of the engine compared to commercial gasoline.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PET, PUR) in a batch reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis via GC-MS, and engine test results, satisfying all required conditions."
"Pyrolysis-gasification of wastes plastics for syngas production using metal modified zeolite catalysts under different ratio of nitrogen/oxygen The aim of this study was the syngas production by the gasification of plastic waste (polyethylene, polypropylene and terephthalate polyethylene). Ca, Ce, La, Mg and Mn were used to promote the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in order to enhance the production of higher syngas yield. The modified catalysts can enhanced the reaction rate of the pyrolysis process and resulting in high syngas in the product yields. Especially cerium, lanthanum promoted catalysts can enhance the yield of syngas. The effect of the reaction temperature and nitrogen/oxygen ratio of the carrier gas was also investigated. The maximum syngas production was obtained with lanthanum catalyst (112.2 mmol/g (95%N2 and 5%O2), and 130.7 mmol/g (90%N2 and 10%O2) at 850 °C. Less carbon depositions was found at 850 °C or even by the using of catalyst and more oxygen in the carrier gas. The oxygen content of the pyrolysis-gasification atmosphere had a key role to the syngas yield and affects significantly the carbon-monoxide/carbon-dioxide ratio. Catalysts can also accelerate the methanization reactions and isomerize the main carbon frame. Increasing in both temperature and oxygen in the atmosphere led to higher n-paraffin/n-olefin ratio and more multi-ring aromatic hydrocarbons in pyrolysis oils. The concentration of hydrocarbons containing oxygen and branched compounds was also significantly affected by catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis-gasification of waste plastics (PE, PP, PET) with measurable syngas yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under defined reactor conditions."
"Simultaneous production of aromatics-rich bio-oil and carbon nanomaterials from catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic wastes and in-line catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis gas An integrated process that includes catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic wastes and in-line catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis gas were conducted to simultaneously produce aromatics-rich bio-oil and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The influences of feedstocks blending ratio on the characteristics of bio-oil and CNTs were established. The reaction mechanism of carbon deposition during the system was also probed. The results showed that co-feeding plastic to biomass siginificantly enhanced the selectivity of monoaromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) from 5.6% for pure biomass to the maximum yield of 44.4% for 75.0% plastic ratio, and decreased naphthalene and its derivates from 85.9 to 41.7% correspondingly. The most synergistic effect on BTX selectivity occurred at 25% of plastic ratio. The multi-walled CNTs were successfully synethsized on Ni catalyst by utilizing prolysis gas as feedstocks. For pure biomass, the least CNTs yield with ultrafine diameters of 3.9–8.5 nm was generated via disproportionation reaction of CO which was derived from decarboxylation and decarbonylation of oxygenates on the ZSM-5 acid sites. With the rise of plastic ratio, sufficient hydrocarbons were produced for CNTs growth, endowing CNTs with long and straight tube walls, along with uniform diameters (~16 nm). The CNTs yield increased as high as 139 mg/g-cata. In addition, the decreased CO2 inhibited dry reforming with C1-C4 hydrocarbons and deposited carbon, avoiding excessive etching of CNTs. Thereby, high-purity CNTs with less defects were fabricated when plastic ratio was beyond 50% in the feedstock. The strategy is expected to improve the sustainability and economic viability of biomass pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass wastes, with measurable yields of aromatics-rich bio-oil and carbon nanotubes, including detailed product composition and catalyst performance data."
"Thermal decomposition of flame retarded polycarbonates The effect of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and tris(2,4-di-ter-dibuthylphenyl-phosphite) (TBP) flame retardants were examined on the thermal decomposition of polycarbonate by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) techniques. The maximal rate of polycarbonate decomposition shifted to a slightly lower temperature in the presence of TBBA. More than 20 bromine containing products were identified among the pyrolysis products of the polycarbonate sample containing TBBA flame retardant at 550 and 700°C temperature. Significant decrease of the total evaluated volatile compounds was found at 550°C from the APP blended polycarbonate and at 700°C pyrolysis temperature in the presence of both phosphor-containing flame retardants investigated. The presence of the examined phosphorous flame retardants has no effect on the temperature regarding the radical decomposition of polycarbonate, while partial hydrolysis takes place at a lower temperature due to APP. The polycarbonate chain keenly decomposes under gradual heating in the temperature range of ammonia evolution from APP. The product analysis indicates that APP accelerates the formation of phenol and isopropylene phenol from the bisphenol A segments of polycarbonate.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of flame-retarded polycarbonate, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields and composition analysis via Py-GC/MS and TG/MS, including temperature-dependent decomposition behavior and catalyst (flame retardant) effects."
"Analysis of products from the pyrolysis of plastics recovered from the commercial scale recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment Three plastic fractions from a commercial waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) processing plant were collected and investigated for the possibility of recycling them by batch pyrolysis. The first plastic was from equipment containing cathode ray tubes (CRTs), the second plastic was from refrigeration equipment, and the third plastic was from mixed WEEE. Initially, the decomposition of each of the plastics was investigated using a TGA linked to a FT-ir spectrometer which showed that the CRT plastic decomposed to form aliphatic and aromatic compounds, the refrigerator plastic decomposed to form aldehydes, CO2, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds, and the mixed WEEE plastic decomposed to form aromatic and aliphatic compounds, CO2, and CO. Each plastic mixture was also pyrolysed in a batch reactor to determine the halogen and metal content of the pyrolysis products, additionally, characterisation of the pyrolysis oils was carried out by GC–MS and the pyrolysis gases by GC–FID and GC–TCD. It was found that the halogen content of the oils was relatively low but the halogen and metal content of the chars was high. The pyrolysis oils were found to contain valuable chemical products and the pyrolysis gases were mainly halogen free, making them suitable as a fuel.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics from WEEE, with measurable product yields, GC–MS and GC–FID/TCD analysis of oils and gases, and TGA-FTIR characterization, satisfying all mandatory criteria."
"Tailored HZSM-5 catalyst modification via phosphorus impregnation and mesopore introduction for selective catalytic conversion of polypropylene into light olefins The waste polyolefin composition varies regionally due to different sorting technologies, emphasizing the necessity for a robust catalyst capable of selectively converting pyrolysis vapors into valuable light olefins while maintaining stability. HZSM-5, a microporous catalyst, efficiently cracks polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis vapors rich in linear aliphatics. However, polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis typically yields branched olefins, potentially hindering effectiveness of HZSM-5 due to mass transfer constraints and coke blockage in micropores. This study modifies HZSM-5 through phosphorus impregnation, mesopore introduction, and steam treatment to evaluate the impact of acidity, pore size, and surface modifications on catalyst stability and light olefin selectivity during PP pyrolysis vapor cracking. Subsequent experiments reveal the superior stability of modified catalysts. Phosphorus-modified (P-HZSM-5ss) and mesoporous phosphorus-modified (P-mesoHZSM-5ss) catalysts retain 72 % and 80 % of their initial activity after 150 runs, respectively, while the parent HZSM-5 experiences a rapid 44 % activity loss. P-mesoHZSM-5ss demonstrates the highest light olefin selectivity (63 wt%) after 150 runs, attributed to improved accessibility of branched olefinic products to active sites within catalyst pores. Further optimization achieves exceptional light olefin selectivity of 84 wt% at 117 ms contact time and 550 °C, surpassing maximum selectivity of the parent catalyst. Comparative analyses of PP, PE, and mixed polyolefinic waste pyrolysis vapor cracking revealed the influence of polyolefin type on optimal operational conditions, stressing the need for flexibility in operating conditions to scale up the proposed polyolefin recycling method. This study highlights the potential of tailored catalyst modifications and process optimization to efficiently convert PP into valuable light olefins, advancing sustainable polyolefin recycling technologies.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of light olefin selectivity and catalyst stability."
"Synergistic co-pyrolysis of biogas residue and plastic mulch film: Mechanisms and product selectivity control The co-pyrolysis of agricultural waste, specifically biogas residue (BR), and plastic mulch film (MF) faces significant challenges in product selectivity control due to the unclear mechanisms by which heating rates influence reaction pathways. This study systematically investigates the synergistic effects of heating rates and blending ratios during BR-MF co-pyrolysis by comparing slow pyrolysis (20 °C·min−1, tubular furnace) and flash pyrolysis (instantaneous heating to 600 °C, Py-GC/MS). Flash pyrolysis at a 1:1 mass ratio substantially increases the total hydrocarbon yield to 79.93 %, exceeding the theoretical value by 50.99 %, driven by alkyl radicals (·CH3, ·C2H5) from MF cracking that selectively cleave C-O/C-N bonds in BR. This reduces the formation of oxygenates and nitrogenous compounds by 22.53 % and 99.64 %, respectively. In contrast, slow pyrolysis facilitates hydrogen radical coupling with oxygenated fragments, increasing alcohol production by 8.04 %, and promotes secondary aromatization, enhancing aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity by 9.37 %. Flash pyrolysis, however, improves the selectivity of olefins and long-chain alcohols by 25.70 % and 17.93 %, respectively, via a hydrogen transfer-radical stabilization mechanism. These findings provide a scientific foundation for the valorization of agricultural waste and propose viable strategies for biofuel and chemical production, with substantial implications for environmental sustainability and energy recovery.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic mulch film and biogas residue with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of blended biomass – plastic mixture using synthesized metal oxide(MO)-dolomite based catalyst Co-pyrolysis is one of the best new technologies to utilise excess of plastic waste where the products are generated in the form of oil, gas and char. A selective catalyst is needed to improve the quality of the co-pyrolysis product, in which, oil with low of oxygenated compounds content and high yield of oil are favoured. In this work, Malaysian dolomite was modified by doping with transition metals (Ni/Fe/Ca) at 10 wt% loading using the precipitation method and then compared with a modified commercial catalyst named NiO/ZSM-5 zeolite. Co-pyrolysis was conducted using empty fruit bunch (EFB) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) at 500 °C operating temperature, 10 cm3/min N2 flow rate, 10 wt% catalyst loading, 1:3 HDPE:EFB ratio and 75 g of feedstock with 60 min of operating time in a stainless-steel fluidised bed reactor. The catalysts were characterised using different analysis methods such as XRD, BET and SEM. The highest gas yield of 68% was obtained by increasing the content of calcium oxide (CaO) in dolomite (in dolomite (CaO/CMD900). For the Fe-doped dolomite (Fe3O4/CMD900), the highest oil yield (10.34 wt%) and a high content oxygenated compounds were obtained. For the Ni-doped dolomite (NiO/CMD900), the oil with the highest hydrocarbon yield (85.32 %) and low oxygenated compound (14.68 %) was obtained. This study confirms that modified dolomite can increase the yield and quality of bio-oil.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) with biomass in a fluidized-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Investigation of catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene by hydrocarbon group type analysis Catalytic degradation of waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to hydrocarbons by ZSM-5, zeolite-Y, mordenite and amorphous silica–alumina were carried out in a batch reactor to investigate the cracking efficiency of catalysts by analyzing the oily products including paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Catalytic degradation of HDPE with zeolite-Y, mordenite and amorphous silica–alumina yielded 71–82 wt.% oil fraction, which mostly consisted of C6–C12 hydrocarbons, whereas ZSM-5 yielded much lower 35% oil fraction, which mostly consisted of C6–C12 hydrocarbons. Both all zeolites and silica–alumina increased olefin content in oil products, and ZSM-5 and zeolite-Y particularly enhanced the formation of aromatics and branched hydrocarbons. ZSM-5 among zeolites showed the greatest catalytic activity on cracking waste HDPE to light hydrocarbons, whereas mordenite produced the greatest amount of coke. Amorphous silica–alumina also showed a great activity on cracking HDPE to lighter olefins in high yield, but no activity on aromatic formation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis via GC/MS."
"Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste with magnetic catalysts in a multi-ridge field compressed reactor Environmental crises caused by plastic pollution have spurred the development of novel recovery and upcycling methods. In this study, a microwave magnetic field and magnetic catalyst cracking strategy based on a microwave multi-ridge field compressed reactor was proposed to efficiently convert polyethylene into hydrogen and high-quality carbon nanotubes while minimising energy consumption. A series of catalysts with different iron and cobalt contents was prepared and evaluated for hydrogen production from polyethylene cracking. A high hydrogen yield of 61.6 mmol·g−1 plastic was obtained in the magnetic field position with an energy consumption of only 5 W·h g−1 plastic, whereas the hydrogen yield was 45.7 mmol·g−1 plastic under microwave electric field. Under microwave magnetic field activation, the magnetic catalyst CoFeO x exhibited higher selectivity for H2 than hydrocarbons in waste plastics. In addition, high hydrogen yields were achieved by varying the ratio of the catalyst feedstock in the electric field and intermediate positions of the reactor. This reactor separates the microwave fields in the reactor and places catalysts with different absorption characteristics at different positions, which can significantly improve the efficiency of microwave energy utilisation.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polyethylene waste plastic with magnetic catalysts, demonstrating measurable hydrogen yields, catalyst performance, and reactor efficiency under controlled experimental conditions."
"Effect of sodium zeolite mixed metal oxide catalysts on catalytic conversion of mixed-density plastic into carbon nanotubes and hydrogen fuel A combination of experimental and statistical analysis presents a comprehensive understanding of the microwave pyrolysis technique for catalytic deconstruction of mixed-density plastics. By optimizing the process parameters and catalyst selection, it is possible to maximize the production of valuable solid and energy products, contributing to sustainable waste management. In this work, different mixed-density plastics were pyrolyzed with different catalysts and residence times to yield liquid fuel, syngas, and structured carbon residue. The effect of inputs on the product type, yield and composition was statistically evaluated using ANOVA, which showed an F value of 4.108 and a p-value of 0.098 (>1.00). FTIR and GC-MS revealed that the oil product consisted of C13+ fractions in the form of alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics. The microscopic analysis of the residue confirmed the formation of carbon nanotubes along with other amorphous products. The presence of impurities in the solid product was further analyzed through XRD analysis. The pyrolytic liquid fuel revealed the presence of conjugated aromatic structure and carbonyl group in their concentration. This research demonstrated that converting mixed-density plastics using sodium zeolite, aluminum oxide, and nickel oxide catalysts yields 84% valuable products, confirming wasted plastics as a lucrative energy feedstock for producing hydrogen and high-value carbon compounds.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of mixed-density plastics with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis, and characterization techniques such as FTIR, GC-MS, and XRD."
"Synergistic co-pyrolysıs of polyolefin plastics with wood and agricultural wastes for biofuel production Renewable lignocellulosic biomass is a promising energy resource since its co-pyrolysis with hydrogen-rich plastics can produce high-yield and high-quality bio-oil. In this study, co-pyrolysis of agricultural wastes (i.e. corn stover) and wood wastes (i.e. narra, Pterocarpus indicus and ipil, Intsia bijuga) with polyolefin plastics (i.e. polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene) were examined via thermogravimetric analyses. Unlike previous co-pyrolysis studies which had focused on the improvement of product yield or cumulative weight loss, herein, we present the synergistic effects on the mass decomposition rate or rate of generation of products during co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of temperature, and biomass-to-plastic ratio on rate synergy during co-pyrolysis. Rate synergy values up to 10% per min were obtained for biomass and plastic blends. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reactions in the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated using the Coats-Redfern method. Activation energies for agricultural waste and plastics blends ranged from 45 to 82 kJ mol−1 while that for wood wastes and plastic blends ranged from 53 to 112 kJ mol−1. Interestingly, the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of plastic was found to be lower during co-pyrolysis with biomass than in pure form. Moreover, biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis followed a two-stage degradation: biomass degradation from 200 to 400 °C and thereafter plastic degradation from 400 to 500 °C. Overall, the use of lignocellulosic biomass and waste plastics for biofuel production can also minimize the volume of solid wastes for landfills.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste polyolefin plastics with lignocellulosic biomass, includes measurable product yield and activation energy data, and uses experimental techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic modeling."
"Benzoic acid recovery via waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) catalytic pyrolysis using sulphated zirconia catalyst Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the main plastics used in food packaging products, which have a very short life and are rapidly transformed into waste, and accounts for 7 wt% of the total plastic waste generated. Current PET waste management, mainly via mechanical recycling and glycolysis, have encountered a number of issues: negative impact on the environment, segregation of waste and product separation/purification. Therefore other versatile alternatives such as pyrolysis should be employed to recover value-added products from waste. Benzoic acid a precursor in the food and beverage industry, derived from PET via thermochemical conversion opposed to the current manufacturing process from fossil fuel-based feedstock is considered as a promising approach. In this study, the effect of operating conditions i.e. temperature, catalyst to plastic mass ratio and volatiles residence time and their interactions on product yields and properties were studied. Sulphated zirconia (SZ) was first time used for catalytic pyrolysis of PET due to its high acidity and environmentally friendly synthesis. Results showed that up to 27–32 wt% benzoic acid could be recovered through PET pyrolysis at 450–600 °C at 20 s residence time. By increasing the catalyst:plastic ratio to 10 wt% only 26 wt% of benzoic acid was recovered in the wax but it increased the amount of other valuable products i.e. light hydrocarbons (C1–C3) recovered in the gas.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste PET plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Conversion of waste rubber to the mixture of hydrocarbons in the reactor with molten metal Scrap tires are the source of renewable energy and raw chemical products for the refinery, petrochemical and rubber industry. The results of thermal degradation of waste rubber performed in a new type of a tubular reactor with the molten metal bed are presented in the paper. The melting and degradation processes were carried out in one apparatus at the temperature 390–420°C. The time of the described conversion process is shorter than the time of catalytic cracking or pyrolysis performed in classical batch or continuous flow reactors. The process was carried out in the inside of the molten metal bed and on its surface. The problems encountered with: the disintegration of wastes, the heat transfer from the wall to the particles, cooking at the walls of the reactor, and mixing of the molten volume of wastes are significantly reduced. Three products: the gaseous (below 14wt.%), liquid (over 41wt.%) product and solid residue were obtained during the degradation of waste rubber. The streams of gaseous and liquid products were analyzed by gas chromatography. The gaseous stream contained hydrocarbons from C2 to C8 and the liquid product consisted of hydrocarbons C4–C24. Over 75mol% of liquid hydrocarbons mixture was the fraction C4–C10. The obtained liquid product may be used in petrochemical and refinery industry for fuel production.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste rubber (a plastic waste material) in a tubular reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"Pollutant emissions during the pyrolysis and combustion of flexible polyurethane foam Thermal decomposition of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) was studied under nitrogen and air atmospheres at 550°C and 850°C using a laboratory scale reactor to analyse the evolved products. Ammonia, hydrogen cyanide and nitrile compounds were obtained in high yields in pyrolysis at the lower temperature, whereas at 850°C polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other semivolatile compounds, especially compounds containing nitrogen (benzonitrile, aniline, quinolone and indene) were the most abundant products. Different behaviour was observed in the evolution of polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) at 550°C and 850°C. At 550°C, the less chlorinated congeners, mainly PCDF, were more abundant. Contrarily, at 850°C the most chlorinated PCDD were dominant. In addition, the total yields of PCDD/Fs in the pyrolysis and combustion runs at 850°C were low and quite similar.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of flexible polyurethane foam, a waste plastic, with measurable product yields and composition analysis at specific temperatures."
"Thermal pyrolysis of waste versus virgin polyolefin feedstocks: The role of pressure, temperature and waste composition Due to the complexity and diversity of polyolefinic plastic waste streams and the inherent non-selective nature of the pyrolysis chemistry, the chemical decomposition of plastic waste is still not fully understood. Accurate data of feedstock and products that also consider impurities is, in this context, quite scarce. Therefore this work focuses on the thermochemical recycling via pyrolysis of different virgin and contaminated waste-derived polyolefin feedstocks (i.e., low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) as main components), along with an investigation of the decomposition mechanisms based on the detailed composition of the pyrolysis oils. Crucial in this work is the detailed chemical analysis of the resulting pyrolysis oils by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) and ICP-OES, among others. Different feedstocks were pyrolyzed at a temperature range of 430–490 °C and at pressures between 0.1 and 2 bar in a continuous pilot-scale pyrolysis unit. At the lowest pressure, the pyrolysis oil yield of the studied polyolefins reached up to 95 wt%. The pyrolysis oil consists of primarily α-olefins (37–42 %) and n-paraffins (32–35 %) for LDPE pyrolysis, while isoolefins (mostly C9 and C15) and diolefins accounted for 84–91 % of the PP-based pyrolysis oils. The post-consumer waste feedstocks led to significantly less pyrolysis oil yields and more char formation compared to their virgin equivalents. It was found that plastic aging, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (3 wt%), and metal contamination were the main causes of char formation during the pyrolysis of polyolefin waste (4.9 wt%).","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of waste and virgin polyolefin plastics (LDPE, PP) with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions specified."
"Comparison of the pyrolysis behavior of PC, ABS and PC/ABS Three types of plastics—polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and PC/ABS blend—were studied in this work. Kinetic analyses were performed using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) methods. The evolved volatiles during the pyrolysis of each material were analyzed, and the pyrolysis behavior was proposed using in-situ tools such as thermogravimetric analyzer-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (TG-FTIR) and gas chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry detection (Py-GC/MS). The three samples were also pyrolysed in a fixed bed reactor to elucidate the impact of secondary reaction. For PC, the activation energy increases as the reaction progresses. PC primarily generated CO2 and oxygenated compounds. For ABS, the activation energy experienced a slight decrease once the depolymerization reaction initiates, while a reversed trend can be observed at higher conversion rates. ABS pyrolysis mainly produced nitrogen-containing compounds and mono-aromatics. In the case of PC/ABS blend, a distinctive two-stage decomposition mechanism was observed. The interaction between PC and ABS in the blend promoted the formation of N/O-containing compounds. Additionally, this interaction enhanced the production of lighter phenols at the expense of bisphenol A, while ABS was not affected markedly. Stronger re-condensation and cracking reactions in the fixed bed system, facilitated the formation of poly-aromatics and lighter phenols (p-cresol and 4-ethylphenol) at the expense of bisphenol A during the pyrolysis of PC. In contrast, styrene from ABS decomposition was weakly affected by the secondary reaction. The intensified secondary reactions occurring the sample bed of the fixed bed experiments can also enhance the interaction between volatiles from ABS and PC, forming more heterocyclic N-compounds.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics PC, ABS, and PC/ABS blend with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Pyrolysis of a fraction of waste polypropylene and polyethylene for the recovery of BTX aromatics using a fluidized bed reactor Fractions of waste polypropylene and polyethylene were pyrolyzed in a pyrolysis plant under different conditions. In this study, the influence of the reaction temperature (650–750°C), the feed rate, and the kind of fluidizing medium on the product spectrum were investigated. Pyrolysis of the PP fraction produced oils up to 43wt.% of the product. With respect to the PE fraction, the maximum oil yield was above 60wt.% of the product. The target compound was BTX aromatics, whose amount in the oils reached 53wt.% for the PP fraction and 32wt.% for the PE fraction. It was shown that the PE fraction yielded a higher liquid product compared to the PP fraction, and that the concentration of aromatics in the oil increased at higher reaction temperatures for both the PP and PE fractions. A higher feed rate and the use of a gas product as the fluidizing medium were favored for the production of oils for both the PP and PE fractions. The oils that were obtained in the experiments almost had no metal and chlorine contents. The maximum heating value of the gas obtained in the experiments was about 50MJ/kg.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Discernment of synergism in co-pyrolysis of HDPE and PP waste plastics for production of pyro-oil: Mechanistic investigation with economic analysis and health risk assessment Plastic waste is a major environmental challenge globally as it can hazard the soil, groundwater, marine, and land creatures. It also emits several toxic gases in open environment when heated up. The ceaseless demands for plastic materials due to wide applications generated a high volume of plastic waste which can impact sustainability development. The present study reports synergism in co-pyrolysis of mixed waste plastic for production of value-added products with economic analysis and health risk assessment. The characterization results of mass spectroscopy and NMR revealed that the product contains different types of hydrocarbons such as paraffins, aromatic, cyclic olefins, and lower hydrocarbons. The physicochemical characterization of pyro-oil showed similar fuel properties to that of commercial diesel (CD). Blending of pyro-oil obtained from HDPE:PP (20:80) improved the fuel quality that results in high brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and reduced brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). At the maximum load condition, ∼19.17% and 29.43% enhancement in BTE were observed with 10% and 20% PO blending, respectively. Also, ∼23.4% of fuel consumption was reduced when 20% PO blend was used with CD. The results showed that the maximum CO emission of 30.93% could be reduced by blending 10% PO. The engine performance and combustion characteristics revealed that PO blended fuels emit low percentage of CO, NOx, CO2, and HC – which essentially suggest a better life style by minimizing the health risks via reduction in greenhouse gas emission that may cause cardiovascular collapse, seizures, coma, and sometimes death. Thus, the present study will help in valorization and mitigation of generated waste plastics through energy conservation and boost the circular economy. The economic analysis based on the present investigation showed that ∼₹9.73 (0.12$) profit per litter can be achieved in the first year itself, while the profit in the 2nd and 5th year could be increased up to ₹54.43 (0.68$) and ₹67.73 (0.85$), respectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste HDPE and PP plastics, reports measurable product yields and fuel performance metrics, and includes experimental characterization of pyro-oil via spectroscopy and engine testing."
"Chemical upcycling of PVC-containing plastic wastes by thermal degradation and catalysis in a chlorine-rich environment Chlorine (Cl)-containing chemicals, including hydrogen chloride, generated during thermal degradation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and corresponding mixture impede the chemical recycling of PVC-containing plastic wastes. While upgrading plastic-derived vapors, the presence of Cl-containing chemicals may deactivate the catalysts. Accordingly, herein, catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis vapor prepared from a mixture of PVC and polyolefins is performed using a fixed-bed reactor comprising zeolites. Among the H-forms of zeolites (namely, ZSM-5, Y, β, and chabazite) used in this study, a higher yield of gas products composed of hydrocarbons with lower carbon numbers is obtained using H-ZSM-5, thus indicating further decomposition of the pyrolysis vapor to C1–C4 hydrocarbons on it. Although the formation of aromatic compounds is better on H-ZSM-5, product distributions can be adjusted by further modifying the acidic properties via the alteration of the Si/Al molar ratio, and maximum yields of C1–C4 compounds (60.8%) and olefins (64.7%) are achieved using a Si/Al molar ratio of 50. Additionally, metal ion exchange on H-ZSM-5 is conducted, and upgrading of PVC-containing waste-derived vapor to aromatic chemicals and small hydrocarbon molecules was successfully performed using Co-substituted H-ZSM-5. It reveals that the highest yield of gas products on 1.74 wt% cobalt (Co)-substituted H-ZSM-5 is acquired via the selection of an appropriate metal and metal ion concentration adjustment. Nevertheless, introduction of excess Co into the H-ZSM-5 surface decreases the cracking activity, thereby implying that highly distributed Co is required to achieve excellent cracking activity. The addition of Co also adjusted the acid types of H-ZSM-5, and more Lewis acid sites compared to Brønsted acid sites selectively produced olefins and naphthenes over paraffins and aromatics. The proposed approach can be a feasible process to produce valuable petroleum-replacing chemicals from Cl-containing mixed plastic wastes, contributing to the closed loops for upcycling plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on pyrolysis of PVC-containing mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Boosting aromatic production from pine sawdust and waste plastics co-pyrolysis via acidity tuning of HZSM-5 Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes represents an appealing approach to obtain value-added aromatics and contribute to resource utilization. Herein, the boost of HZSM-5 (HZ-5) catalyst acidity on aromatics in co-pyrolysis products of pine sawdust (PW) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was investigated. HZ-5 zeolites with varying b-axis lengths (B-HZ-5) and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were hydrothermally prepared, while metal-loaded HZ-5 zeolites (X/B-HZ-5, X = Pd, Zn, Ni, Fe, Mg) were synthesized by wet impregnation method to tune the acidity of zeolites. Results showed that B-HZ-5(2.5) achieved aromatics selectivity (96.98 %) and BTEX selectivity (59.41 %) when SiO2/Al2O3 ratio was 50, temperature was 550 ℃, and catalyst-to-feedstock ratio was 2: 1. The proportion of p-xylene in xylene was improved to 94.82 %. Zn/B-HZ-5(2.5) raised BTEX selectivity (74.48 %) and reduced polyaromatics (PAHs) selectivity (19.88 %). The characterization results manifested that urea reduced external Bronsted acid (B-acid) concentration of HZ-5 by changing its crystal size along the b-axis, inhibiting BTEX alkylation and MAHs polymerization on the outer surface of HZ-5. A lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio indicated more B-acid, enhancing aromatization activity. Incorporation of ZnOH+ interacted with external B-acid of B-HZ-5 to generate new Lewis acid (L-acid), which enhanced cyclization and dehydrogenation activity, inhibiting further aromatics oligomerization and reducing PAHs selectivity.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) and biomass (pine sawdust) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis including aromatics and BTEX selectivity."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene over nickel-waste chicken eggshell/HZSM-5 The main objective of the current work is to investigate the effect of nickel–waste chicken eggshell modified Hydrogen exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (Ni-WCE/HZSM-5) on pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Ni-WCE/HZSM-5 was synthesized via the impregnation incipient wetness (IWI) method with Ni and WCE mass loading of 4 and 12 wt% respectively. HZSM-5, CaO, WCE, WCE/HZSM-5, and Ni/HZSM-5 were prepared for comparison purposes with Ni-WCE/HZSM-5. All the synthesized catalysts were characterized for phase analysis, metal loading, surface morphology, and textural properties. The impregnation of nickel and WCE had significantly affected the original framework of HZSM-5, where the crystallinity percentage and average crystal size of HZSM-5 dropped to 44.97% and increased to 47.90 nm respectively. The surface morphology of HZSM-5 has drastically changed from a cubic-like shape into a spider web-like surface after the impregnation of WCE. The BET surface area of HZSM-5 has been lowered due to the impregnation of nickel and WCE, but the total pore volume has increased greatly from 0.2291 cm3/g to 0.2621 cm3/g. The catalyst performance was investigated in the pyrolysis of HDPE via a fixed bed reactor and the pyrolysis oil was further analysed to evaluate the distribution of C6 to C9> hydrocarbons. Among the tested catalytic samples, the highest pyrolysis oil yield was achieved by WCE (80%) followed by CaO (78%), WCE/HZSM-5 (63%), HZSM-5 (61%), Ni/HZSM-5 (44%) and Ni-WCE/HZSM-5 (50%). For hydrocarbon distribution in pyrolysis oil, the Ni/HZSM-5 produced the highest of total C6 and C7 hydrocarbons at 12% and 27% respectively followed by WCE/HZSM-5 (4% and 20%), non-catalytic (5% and 13%), Ni-WCE/HZSM-5 (0% and 15%), WCE (0% and 10%), HZSM-5 (0% and 6%) and CaO (0% and 0%).",The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields and detailed analytical characterization of catalysts and pyrolysis oil composition.
"Plastics pyrolysis: The impact of pyrolysis temperature on ethylene production and direct carbon dioxide footprint An attempt to estimate the energy and emissions for chemically recycling polyethylene is presented. The workflow includes an experimental section to generate pyrolysis decomposition data, and a process model to simulate the process. Pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatographic separation with mass spectrometric and flame ionization detection (Pyr-GC–MS/FID) was carried out at different temperatures, ranging from 600 to 800 °C on both low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pellets and linear low-density (LLDPE) pellets. The hydrocarbon composition of the pyrolyzed materials was determined using the MS data, while quantification was performed using the FID data. The quantified hydrocarbon composition was then used as the input data for modeling the pyrolysis reactor and separations process in Aspen Plus. The direct CO2 emissions were estimated for downstream chemical processes, such as pyrolysis oil hydroprocessing, steam cracking, and polymerization. The process analysis included the evaluation of scenarios where the pyrolysis plant was located in a stand-alone site and integrated with surrounding chemical plants. It was shown that higher pyrolysis temperatures create the possibility for collocating a pyrolysis plant with the steam cracker process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of LDPE and LLDPE pellets at varying temperatures with measurable product yields and composition analysis via Pyr-GC–MS/FID, including quantification and temperature–yield relationships."
"Pollutant emissions during the pyrolysis and combustion of starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) biodegradable films The massive use of petroleum-based polymers and their improper waste treatment has brought on significant global environmental problems due to their non-biodegradable nature. Starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) bioplastics are suitable substitutes for conventional polymers, such as polyethylene, due to their full biodegradability and excellent mechanical properties. Knowledge of the pollutant emissions during pyrolysis and combustion of starch/PVA films is important because they can arrive at landfills mixed with conventional polymers and be thermally degraded in uncontrolled fires. On the other hand, controlled thermal treatments could result in thermal valorization of the waste. Pyrolysis and combustion experiments were carried out at 650, 750, 850 and 950 °C in a laboratory furnace. The analysis of carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, and semivolatile compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is shown. Experiments showed lower pollutant emissions than those found with conventional polymers, such as polyethylene and polyester, in the same equipment. Nevertheless, the pyrolysis run at 950 °C showed the highest light hydrocarbon yield (123013 mg kg−1), but this is considerably lower than the values found for polyethylene. The main semivolatile compounds (not PAHs) emitted, with maximum yields ranging from 1351 to 4694 mg kg−1, were benzaldehyde, phenol, indene, and acetophenone. Specifically, the total semivolatile compounds emitted after pyrolysis and combustion of starch/PVA samples represent only 38 and 50%, respectively, of those emitted with polyethylene. Further, the main PAHs were naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and phenanthrene with maximum values of 4694, 2704 and 1496 mg kg−1, respectively. The PAH yield was considerably higher in experiments with low oxygen content.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of starch/PVA biodegradable films, a type of plastic, with measured pollutant emissions and product yields at specific temperatures."
"Catalytic upcycling of waste plastics over nanocellulose derived biochar catalyst for the coupling harvest of hydrogen and liquid fuels A powerful simple biochar catalyst derived from nanocellulose was applied to the catalytic upcycling of waste plastics into H2 and liquid fuels for the first time. For the results from model low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pyrolysis, the C8-C16 aliphatics and monocyclic aromatics were dominant constitutes of the liquid product with the yields ranging from 22 to 68 wt%. At the temperature of 500 °C and biochar to LDPE ratio surpassing 3, the LDPE could be completely degraded into liquid and gas without wax production. A wax yield of 16 wt% was observed at the temperature of 450 °C and biochar to LDPE ratio of 4, which was dramatically lower than that (77 wt%) from the absence of biochar at the temperature of 500 °C. Up to 92 vol% of H2 was detected in the gaseous product with a yield of 36 wt%. The lower temperatures and higher biochar to LDPE ratios favored increasing the generation of H2 at the expense of light gas C n H m especially CH4. Moreover, this biochar catalyst was tested effectively to convert the real waste plastics including grocery bags and packaging tray into valuable liquid and H2-enriched gas.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and real plastic waste) with measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions."
"Enhancing catalytic performance for waste plastic upgrading: Simultaneous regulation of pore structure and acid sites in Ga-doped desilicated HZSM-5 catalysts Though catalytic pyrolysis through HZSM-5 has shown great potential to convert waste plastics, it is urgent to modify the catalyst to improve its catalytic performance due to the low liquid product yields and inferior selectivity to high value-added monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). During the study, two main modification methods, desilication via alkali treatment and Ga metal doping, were applied on HZSM-5 to reach simultaneous regulation of pore structure and acid site. It showed that selectivity to MAHs rose from 45.37 % to 58.45 % and 59.54 %, respectively, when 0.1 M and 0.4 M NaOH solutions were used for desilication. After Ga metal doping, selectivity to MAHs further increased to 67.43 % and 67.16 %, respectively, at A 0.1 M 5 %Ga/ZSM-5 and A 0.4 M 5 %Ga/ZSM-5, with selectivity to value-added benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) rising to 50.86 % and 46.45 % correspondingly. After three times of recycling, the catalyst still remained active with selectivity to MAHs staying above 65 %.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using modified HZSM-5 catalysts, with measurable product yields and selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbons reported."
"Production of light olefins and aromatics via catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic Co-pyrolysis of pine and LDPE over basic catalysts (calcium oxide, calcium aluminate, and calcium ferrite), acidic catalysts (ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 40, 80 and 200, commercial FCC and ZSM-5 based catalysts), and acid-base tandem catalysts were investigated by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS to improve light olefins and aromatics production. Research found that co-pyrolysis of pine and LDPE showed a positive synergistic effect and the addition of catalyst could reduce the average apparent activation energy of co-pyrolysis significantly. The optimal base and acid catalysts are calcium aluminate (CaAl) and ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 40 (Z40), respectively. The highest content of light olefins and BTX (69.45 %) can be obtained over base-acid (CaAl-Z40) tandem catalyst at 600 °C, with CaAl to Z40 ratio of 1:1. This work will serve as a relevant reference for production of light olefins and BTX from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics over base-acid tandem catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) and biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Few-walled carbon nanotubes derived from shoe waste plastics: Effect of feedstock composition on synthesis, properties and application as CO2 reduction electrodes This work investigates the chemical recycling of shoe waste plastics, i.e. polyurethane (PU) and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) using a pyrolysis-chemical vapor deposition process over Fe/MgO catalyst. Results suggested PU facilitated highly selective production of few-walled CNTs with small diameters and narrow size distribution while EVA tended to yield multi-walled CNTs. The synergistic interactions between pyrolysis gases components from PU and EVA allowed facile tailoring of CNT size distribution by using either sorted PU and EVA or mixture (EVA/PU) in appropriate ratios. CNTs derived from pure PU or EVA/PU were more suitable in designing effective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction with Faradaic efficiency of 85–95% and CO current density of >9 mA cm−2. This was because the presence of few-walled CNTs could enhance electrical conductivity and specific surface area without compromising the loading of active materials.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PU and EVA) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of resulting CNTs and their electrocatalytic properties."
"Study on the co-pyrolysis of waste tires and plastics Polymer waste has attracted worldwide attention recently due to its potential environmental risks if not disposed of properly. In this study, waste tires (WTs) and three typical kinds of waste plastics (WPs, PVC, PP, and PE) were selected to investigate the characteristics and products distribution of the co-pyrolysis process via TG-FTIR/MS. DTG curves of WTs and WPs mixture show more than one stage. In accordance with the difference in comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) and activation energy, synergy effect exists during the co-pyrolysis process of WT and WP. Among these mixture systems, WTs & PE and WPs & PVC mixture present the highest and lowest CPI values, respectively. Similarly, WTs & PVC (46.75 kJ mol−1) and WTs & PE (318.37 kJ mol−1) exhibit the minimum and maximum activation energies, respectively. Furthermore, the co-pyrolysis mechanism of WTs and WPs through the Malek method was also explored, in which both individual components and mixture followed the principle model of one-dimensional diffusion. In addition, the distribution of products has been analyzed with FTIR and MS. Consequently, the present study will give insight into the co-processing of WTs and WPs, so as to provide basic knowledge for the pyrolysis of polymer waste.","The study investigates the co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PVC) and waste tires using lab-scale thermal analysis (TG-FTIR/MS), reports measurable product distribution, activation energies, and synergy effects, and includes experimental characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Enhancing monocyclic aromatics hydrocarbons production via catalytic co-pyrolysis of cabbage biomass and low-density polyethylene with ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst This study investigates the conversion of cabbage waste (CW) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) via a dual-stage pyrolysis-reforming process using a ZnO/CZSM-5 catalyst. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is utilized to evaluate the thermal degradation patterns and assess the synergy between biomass and plastics during pyrolysis. Incorporating ZnO into the ZSM-5 catalyst significantly reduces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) production by decreasing ZSM-5 acidity. Under optimized operating conditions, which included a ZnO loading of 10 wt%, pyrolysis and reforming temperatures of 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively, and a feedstock-to-catalyst ratio of 2:1, MAHs of 68.5 % and a minimum of PAHs at 5.1 % were achieved. Characterization confirmed the structural integrity and catalytic efficacy of the ZnO/CZSM-5 catalyst. This study emphasizes the opportunities for converting biomass and plastic waste into valuable resources, thereby supporting sustainable energy initiatives and improving waste management strategies.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with cabbage biomass using a ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst, with measurable product yields (68.5% MAHs, 5.1% PAHs) and characterized reactor conditions and catalyst performance."
"Thermal degradation of polyethylene and polystyrene from the packaging industry over different catalysts into fuel-like feed stocks Thermal degradation of waste polymers was carried out as a suitable technique for converting plastic polymers into liquid hydrocarbons, which could be used as feed stock materials. The catalytic degradation of waste plastics (polyethylene and polystyrene) was investigated in a batch reactor over different catalysts (FCC, ZSM-5 and clinoptillolite). The effects of catalysts and their average grain size on the properties of main degradation products (gases, gasoline, diesel oil) are discussed. The temperature range of 410–450°C was used in the process. Both equilibrium FCC catalyst and natural clinoptilolite zeolite catalyst had good catalytic activity to produce light hydrocarbon liquids, and ZSM-5 catalyst produced the highest amount of gaseous products. Gases and liquids formed in cracking reactions were analyzed by gas chromatography. The liquid products consisted of a wide spectrum of hydrocarbons distributed within the C5–C28 carbon number range depending on the cracking parameters. The composition of hydrocarbons had linear non-branched structure in case of polyethylene, while from polystyrene more aromatics (ethyl-benzene, styrene, toluene, and benzene) were produced. The yields of volatile products increased with increasing degradation temperature. The olefin content of liquids was measured with an infrared technique and an olefin concentration of 50–60% was observed. The concentration of unsaturated compounds increased with decreasing temperature, and in the presence of catalysts. The activation energies were calculated on the basis of the composition of volatile products. The apparent activation energies were decreased by catalysts and catalyst caused both carbon-chain and double bond isomerisation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and polystyrene in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis via GC and infrared techniques."
"Enhancing light aromatics production by pre-cracking and enriching effect in catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene over encapsulated ZSM-5@SBA-15 composites The directional pyrolysis of waste plastics into chemicals is limited by the poor access of long-chain paraffin primary vapors to the acid-sites in zeolite micropores during the reaction. We propose enhancing light aromatics (BTEX) production in polypropylene catalytic pyrolysis using encapsulated ZSM-5@SBA-15 composites. The SBA-15 silica encapsulation pre-cracks the bulky paraffins into light aliphatics, enriches these intermediates, and facilitates their diffusion into the ZSM-5 core micropores via the interconnected meso-micro interface, improving the accessibility of internal acid-sites. Through this designed structure, the plastic is sequentially cracked and aromatized into BTEX. Compared to conventional ZSM-5, the composite increases BTEX yield by 49.1 %, reduces heavy hydrocarbons by 42.2 %, and doubles the light-to-heavy hydrocarbon ratio. Acidity analyses and DFT calculations confirm that the encapsulation passivates the external acid-sites of ZSM-5 core, suppressing oligomerization and hard coke formation. This integrated hierarchy combines improved acid-sites accessibility with interface passivation, efficiently catalyzing plastic waste into valuable products for sustainable recycling.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene using encapsulated ZSM-5@SBA-15 composites, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including DFT calculations and acidity analyses."
"Thermal behavior, synergistic effect and thermodynamic parameter evaluations of biomass/plastics co–pyrolysis in a concentrating photothermal TGA The heating rate would significantly impact the pyrolysis process, especially for the reactions containing synergistic effects between two different feedstocks. Co-pyrolysis of two widely available biomass (CC–corncob and PS–peanut shell) with plastic (PET–polyethylene terephthalate and PVC–polyvinyl chloride) was studied in a concentrating photothermal thermogravimetric analysis (CP-TGA) system at three heating rates (100, 500, 1000℃/min). The TG and DTG curves of CC and PS differ due to their polymeric components (holocellulose and lignin); two pronounced levels at 100 and 500 ℃/min heating rates were present in PVC. With increasing heating rate, the lateral shift towards higher temperature regions in the TG and DTG curves exceeded 100 °C. The synergistic effects on the blend samples were concentrated in the main decomposition region (250–580℃) due to rapid volatiles release, and the discrepancy values further stabilized at the final decomposition stages. The activation energy (Ea) was assessed using a comparative study of isoconversional methods, namely Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and Starink. The isoconversional methods demonstrated that the co-pyrolysis process required about 30 % less activation energy than the pyrolysis of plastic (PET/PVC) alone. Coats-Redfern's (CR) model-fitting approach was used to identify the kinetic triplet of the devolatilization stage. The CR models revealed that biomass–PET blends belong to two to four-dimensional diffusion models, whereas biomass–PVC blends are dominated by chemical reactions of 1.5 and 2 orders. The energy barrier between activation energy (Ea) and change in enthalpy (ΔH) for all the blend samples was lower (∼5–6 kJmol−1), which slightly increased at higher heating rate.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PET and PVC) mixed with biomass in a CP-TGA system, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and kinetic parameters derived from experimental data."
"Analysis of pyrolysis index and reaction mechanism in microwave-assisted ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of agro-residual and plastic wastes Catalytic and non-catalytic microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastics was performed to understand the interactions. An ex-situ configuration was adopted for performing catalytic co-pyrolysis experiments with ZSM-5 as a catalyst. Co-pyrolysis promoted cracking of vapors resulting in enhanced gas yields. ZSM-5 further enhanced the secondary cracking which resulted in low oil yields. The oil fraction collected from the pyrolysis of plastics was rich in hydrocarbons, whereas biomass pyrolysis led to the formation of oxygenated compounds in the oil. A plausible reaction mechanism scheme is proposed to understand the formation of major pyrolysis products via different pathways during different pyrolysis processes investigated. Also, a new parameter, the pyrolysis index is introduced to understand the pyrolysis intensity by utilizing the feedstock conversion, pyrolysis time, heating value, mass of feedstock, and energy consumption. The value of the pyrolysis index was found to be higher for plastics pyrolysis than biomass pyrolysis. Co-pyrolysis further increased the pyrolysis index due to the synergistic interactions.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and agro-residual biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"Pyrolysis of polystyrene using low-cost natural catalysts: Production and characterisation of styrene-rich pyro-oils This work aims to study the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) in order to obtain a styrene-rich liquid appealing for re-polymerisation processes. The process was performed in a fixed-bed reactor using low-cost materials such as ilmenite, olivine, calcium oxide (CaO) and dolomite as catalysts at 600 ºC. A non-catalytic test with sand was also conducted for comparison purposes. The resulting pyro-oil yield was between 89 and 96 wt%, and consisted mainly of styrene monomer, styrene dimer and styrene trimer, as well as other light aromatic compounds depending on the catalyst used. Olivine and CaO were capable to increase the styrene monomer concentration in the pyro-oil by about 10–12 % compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis, reaching up to 74.5 and 71.4 wt%, respectively. Furthermore, these catalysts reduced the concentration of styrene dimer and styrene trimer in the pyro-oil, which could be useful for further re-polymerisation processes. However, the presence of polyaromatics (PAHs) in the pyro-oils obtained from ilmenite, olivine and CaO was also identified, and other families such as mono-aromatics, di-aromatics, BTX, and nitrogen heterocyclic compounds were also increased in all pyro-oils obtained with catalysts compared to those obtained by non-catalytic pyrolysis. In addition, several inorganic species in the pyro-oil were reduced by the addition of the catalysts. This effect was observed after the addition of olivine and CaO, especially in the reduction of S, Mg, Ca and Fe. These results clearly demonstrate the potential of pyrolysis to convert PS waste into valuable building blocks for the production of new plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst performance data."
"Recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste through methanolic pyrolysis in a microwave reactor In this study, the methanolic pyrolysis (methanolysis) of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) taken from waste soft-drink bottles, under microwave irradiation, is proposed as a recycling method with substantial energy saving. The reaction was carried out with methanol with and without the use of zinc acetate as catalyst in a sealed microwave reactor in which the pressure and temperature were controlled and recorded. Experiments under constant temperature or microwave power were carried out at several time intervals. The main product dimethyl-terephthalate was analyzed and identified by FTIR and DSC measurements. It was found that PET depolymerization, is favored by increasing temperature, time and microwave power. High degrees of depolymerization were measured at temperatures near 180°C and at microwave power higher than 150W. Most of the degradation was found to occur during the initial 5–10min. Compared to conventional pyrolysis methods, microwave irradiation during methanolic pyrolysis of PET certainly results in shorter reaction times supporting thus the conclusion that this method is a very beneficial one for the recycling of PET wastes.","The study involves microwave-assisted methanolic pyrolysis of waste PET plastic, with measurable yields, temperature–time relationships, catalyst performance, and product analysis via FTIR and DSC."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy-printed circuit board and plastics over HZSM-5 and HY The catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy-printed circuit board (e-PCB) and thermoplastics, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), over HZSM-5 and HY was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The catalytic pyrolysis of e-PCB over both HZSM-5 and HY eliminated the brominated compounds, mainly bromo-phenols and -bisphenol As, to some extent. The co-feeding of HDPE and PP on the catalytic pyrolysis of e-PCB over both HZSM-5 and HY revealed different debromination efficiencies due to the properties of the thermoplastics and catalysts. A comparison of HY(80) and HZSM-5(80) with the same SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (80) revealed HY(80) had a better elimination efficiency of brominated compounds during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of e-PCB and HDPE or PP because of its larger pore size than HZSM-5(80). The lowest bromine content was achieved when HDPE and HY(30) were used as the co-feeding reactant and catalyst on the pyrolysis of e-PCB due to the large pore size and high acidity of HY(30), allowing the easier diffusion of large molecular brominated bisphenol A and HDPE molecules into the pores of the catalyst and efficient catalytic intermolecular reactions in the pores of the catalyst. The catalytic co-pyrolysis of e-PCB and HDPE over HY(30) also produced large amounts of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons and mono-phenol, which can be used as fuels or chemical feedstock.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP) and e-PCB, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Temperature-Dependent NiFeAl catalysts for efficient microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene into value-added hydrogen and carbon nanotubes Polyolefins, comprising the majority of disposable plastics, face challenges in catalytic upcycling due to their inert saturated C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds. This work demonstrates microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, demonstrating the direct conversion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable H2 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) over a porous ternary NiFeAl-T composite catalyst that serve as a microwave absorber. Optimizing the calcination temperature promoted metal nanoparticle dispersion, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. Specifically, lower temperatures favored metal–metal interactions, inducing porous architectures with superior microwave absorption and energy dissipation capabilities. This facilitated cleavage of C–C and C–H bonds in LDPE during microwave irradiation. An optimal NiFeAl-450 catalyst achieved a maximum H2 yield of 60.5 mmol g L D P E - 1 , with an H2 concentration of 85.1 vol% in gas products, alongside high-value MWCNTs. Moreover, successive recycling test displayed stable H2 and MWCNTs yields from LDPE. This work elucidates a promising pathway for upcycling plastic waste via microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable yields of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Evolution of products during the degradation of polyethylene in a batch reactor The thermal degradation of two polyethylene samples (LDPE and HDPE) has been carried out in a batch reactor under dynamic conditions. The evolution of products generated after regular intervals of 5min (temperature increments of approximately 25°C) has been analyzed. The behaviour of LDPE and HDPE has been compared, and no differences in the quantity and weight fraction of the gaseous products obtained have been found. For both polymers, n-paraffins are the major products at the very beginning of the process, while as the decomposition proceeds 1-olefins are more abundant. The condensed fraction is much larger than the gaseous fraction and its analysis reveals some differences between the behaviour of LDPE and HDPE at the beginning of the degradation process. These differences disappear at higher temperatures where more similar trends are observed. 1-Olefins, n-paraffins, dienes and olefins with wide carbon number distributions are the most important condensed compounds obtained in the thermal degradation of both polyethylenes. The formation of 1-olefins and n-paraffins begins at slightly lower temperatures than for dienes and olefins. On the other hand, as the temperature increases, the amount of low and high molecular weight compounds increases at the expense of intermediate molecular weight products and the former become the most important by the end of the degradation process. This behaviour could be related to the thermal cracking of waxes through secondary reactions.","The study involves lab-scale thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of waste polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) in a batch reactor with measured product evolution, yield trends, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Selective production of aromatics from waste plastic pyrolysis by using sewage sludge derived char catalyst Sewage sludge char was used as the catalyst to realize the selective production of aromatics in the pyrolysis of waste mixed plastics. The effect of catalytic temperature, residence time, and plastic compositions on the product yield and distribution were investigated. The catalytic behavior of main ash components was evaluated and discussed. It was found that the selectivity of sludge char to monocyclic aromatics was up to 75.3% when catalytic temperature was 600 °C with a residence time of 1 s. The content of styrene and xylene reached 29.1% and 12.5% in oil, respectively. The selectivity of sludge char to bicyclic aromatics was up to 64.4% when the temperature was 800 °C with the same residence time of 1 s. Naphthalenes accounted for 47.5% of the pyrolysis oil. The interaction among polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene improved the selectivity of bicyclic aromatics from 46.8% to 53.7%. It can be concluded that principal ash components in sludge char could increase the aromatization degree of chain hydrocarbons and reduce the condensation degree of already formed aromatics. Acid sites (mainly aluminum phosphate) and dehydrogenation active sites (mainly -PO, sulfides, etc.) could promote the formation of aromatics by catalyzing direct dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer reaction, and Diels-Alder reaction; while ring-opening active sites (mainly calcium oxide and iron species) could prevent the formation of excessively heavy aromatics by hydrogenation and ring-opening process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste mixed plastics using sewage sludge char catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Solvent-free upcycling of agricultural plastic waste using in situ self-assembly metal nanoparticles co-doped microporous carbocatalyst for advanced transportation fuels Plastic mulching film is ubiquitous in modern agriculture for its heat preservation and moisture retention functions. However, plastic mulching film waste accumulated on land results in microplastic pollution, posing potential hazards as these micro and nanoplastics can enter the food chain. Chemical upcycling of waste mulching film is an emerging strategy to realize sustainable development and circular economy. This study explored an innovative decomposition-catalysis pathway over in situ self-assembly metal nanoparticles (NPs) co-doped microporous carbonaceous catalyst (M/PCCs) to upcycle waste mulching film. M/PCCs with varying Zn and Ni co-additions were tested and found that Zn50-Ni20/CSB1 (ZnCl2: 50 %; NiCl2: 20 %) predominantly favored the formation of liquid hydrocarbons and high-purity H2 production. Importantly, Zn-Ni co-doped on pine sawdust-derived carbon catalyst (Zn-Ni/PSB) with the highest surface area (671 m2/g) and microporosity (76.05 %) exhibited the highest liquid yield (51.67 wt%), and the extremely high carbon selectivity of 89.38 C% for gasoline and 71.98 C% for jet fuel, respectively. Additionally, Zn-Ni/PSB on the time stream was in situ 3D visually evaluated to insightfully unveil the catalytic deconstruction and catalyst deactivation mechanisms. In brief, this study presented a promising solution to effectively upcycle agricultural waste mulching film and thereby mitigate micro and nanoplastics pollution.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of agricultural plastic mulching film using a microporous carbocatalyst, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of liquid hydrocarbon production and catalytic mechanisms."
"Catalytic effect of KF-846 on the reforming of the primary intermediates from the co-pyrolysis of pubescens and LDPE Co-pyrolysis is regarded as an effective approach to upgrade the quality of pyrolysis products. In this work the activity of KF-846 was evaluated by co-pyrolysis of pubescens and low density polyethylene under different experimental conditions including catalytic mode, pyrolytic atmosphere and temperature, etc. The results showed that the fresh KF-846 exerted strong effects of cyclization, aromatization, hydrogen transfer and vapor-catalytic reforming reactions on the primary intermediates from the co-pyrolysis. The hydrogen-rich gases indicated a synergistic effect between Ni and Mo over KF-846 on producing hydrogen. More importantly, the reforming reactions might be inhibited to some extent by H2 atmosphere, the low temperature and the decrease of acidity over catalyst. Furthermore, it was deduced that the oxygen over the lattice of catalyst or some intermediates might transfer into other intermediates, possibly resulting in more products with high oxygen content, but it was presumed that the low temperature, co-pyrolysis process and N2 atmosphere could repress the trend to a certain degree. The mass and energy balance of co-pyrolysis were analyzed, and the main reaction pathways were also proposed. The interference in pyrolysis by regulating the catalytic mode, pyrolytic atmosphere and temperature, acidity over catalyst might posses a certain guiding significance for the pyrolytic technology and the design/selection of catalysts employed.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) with pubescens under controlled conditions, reports measurable product yields and catalyst performance, and includes analytical characterization of reaction pathways and product composition."
"Co-pyrolysis of oil palm trunk and polypropylene: Pyrolysis oil composition and formation mechanism Pyrolysis oil can be used as a precursor to synthesize value-added biochemicals. Co-pyrolysis of two or more feedstocks generally improves the selectivity and yield of the target compounds. In this work, oil palm trunk (OPT) was subjected to single-feed pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis with polypropylene (PP) from 500 to 700 °C. The highest pyrolysis oil yield of 26.33 wt.% was obtained from OPT at 700 °C, which mainly contributed by the lignin decomposition in OPT. Phenolics (51.77–57.78%) and oxygenates (36.31–46.99%) were the major compounds detected in the OPT-derived pyrolysis oil. The addition of PP enhanced the formation of hydrocarbons (5.19–10.22%) and decreased the contents of phenolics (34.01–41.85%) in the co-pyrolysis oil. In the case of co-pyrolysis, the intermolecular reactions between PP and OPT-derived radicals led to the formation of ketones and alcohols, which contributed to the increase of oxygenates content. The highest oil yield of 16.17 wt.% was obtained at 600 °C from co-pyrolysis, the oil of which contained mainly phenolic compounds, oxygenated compounds (i.e., ketones and furans), and hydrocarbons. These findings highlighted the potential of oil derived from the pyrolysis of OPT (single feed) and co-pyrolysis of OPT and PP (binary feed) for the production of value-added chemicals.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) and oil palm trunk, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent results, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Reverse polymerization of waste polystyrene through microwave assisted pyrolysis Reverse polymerization of waste polystyrene (PS) was exploited to produce styrene and other aromatics through microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP), due to the benefits associated with microwave (MW) heating. MAP of PS was run by varying MW power and absorber (tire and carbonaceous char from MAP of tire). A clear and low viscosity liquid containing styrene was always collected as the major product, together with low amount of char and gas. Using a MW power of 3kW and 100g of PS together with 47.3g of carbon gave a liquid (yield 86.5%) containing higher amount of single ring aromatic compounds, as evaluated by GC–MS (aromatics C6–C10 93.9%, styrene 66.0%) a char (yield 9.8%) and a gas (yield 3.7%). Improvements in residence time, by using low MW power or a fractionating system directly inserted over the oven and before the collecting system, allowed us to obtain a liquid with low viscosity and density even if the char yield was 10.0%. Liquid was characterized through physical (density, viscosity, high heating value), and chemical tests (elemental analysis, GC–MS and FT-IR).","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste polystyrene, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and experimental characterization."
"Recycling of automobile shredder residues by means of pyrolysis Automobile shredder residues (ASR) are the rejection of the present processes of metal recovery of end-of-life vehicles. They are composed of several plastics, foams, glasses, rubbers, textiles, remaining metals, soils, etc., and have no clear recycling alternative. In the pyrolysis process (heating to moderate temperatures without oxygen), the organic volatile matter of the waste (plastics, rubber, etc.) is decomposed to gases and liquids, which can be useful as fuels and/or chemicals source. The inorganic components (fillers, metals, glasses, etc.) can be recovered and reused. Therefore, pyrolysis is especially appropriate for recycling complex wastes, such as ASR. In this paper an experimental study of pyrolysis of real ASR samples coming from an automotibile shredder plant (light and heavy ASR) have been studied. The pyrolysis experiments have been carried out in a non-stirred batch 3.5dm3 autoclave at 400, 500 and 700°C for 30min. The raw samples, as well as the solid, liquid and gaseous pyrolysis products have been thoroughly characterized. It is concluded that pyrolysis appears to be an appropriate technique for recycling the heavy ASR, since valuable solids (38–39%), liquids (20–29%) and gases (31–41%) are obtained, while this is not the case for the light ASR, which does not yield valuable products. Concerning temperature 500°C is enough to produce total decomposition of the ASR organic matter. Increasing temperature over 500°C increases gases to the detriment of liquids, but hardly varies the characteristics of the products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real automobile shredder residues (a mixed plastic waste) with measured product yields and temperature–yield relationships, using a batch reactor and comprehensive characterization."
"Preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons from fast pyrolysis of waste medical mask catalyzed by modified HZSM-5 The safe and efficient utilization of waste medical masks has attracted worldwide attention. Fast pyrolysis with the catalysis of zeolites can provide a promising route for the production of value-added aromatic hydrocarbons from waste medical masks. Herein, HZSM-5 was employed and modified by metal loading (Ga, Mo) and alkali treatment for the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of mask filters. The non-catalytic pyrolysis of mask filters only led to a low yield of aromatics. When HZSM-5 catalysts were employed, the liquid long-chain olefins, cycloalkanes, and alcohols, as well as gaseous light hydrocarbons were mainly converted into aromatics. According to the micro-scale pyrolysis experiments, the alkali treatment as well as Ga and Mo loading further promoted the generation of aromatics, with aromatic yields of 52.8 wt%, 54.1 wt%, and 46.3 wt%, respectively. For alkali treatment, the NaOH concentration of 0.3 mol/L was most effective for aromatic production, due to the moderate change in the pore size. For metal loading, Ga loading had better performance than Mo loading because the former resulted in a higher specific surface area while the two modified catalysts possessed similar acid activity. When the two modification methods were combined, the yields of aromatics increased to 56.7 wt% and 60.3 wt% under the catalysis of Mo/Na-HZSM-5 and Ga/Na-HZSM-5. Based on the lab-scale experiments, the aromatic yield could reach 63.0 wt% with the catalysis of Ga/Na-HZSM-5, accompanied by a high selectivity of 87.6% for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). In summary, both MAHs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were promoted with these catalyst modification methods by expanding the mesopore size and adjusting acid site distribution, with greater promotion on the formation of MAHs.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste medical masks, a type of plastic waste, with measurable yields of aromatic hydrocarbons and detailed experimental characterization."
"Iron-doped carbon nanotubes via microwave shock: Recyclability in polypropylene pyrolysis for ORR catalyst manufacturing The recycling and upcycling of waste plastics into high-value products by pyrolysis is a critical challenge caused by its time/energy-consuming problems, which can be overcome by employing microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis due to its rapid pyrolysis rates and high product yields. This study presents a facile method for the synthesis of catalysts for microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics, utilizing the pyrolytic products as raw materials. In this case, a microwave thermal shock strategy is developed to efficiently anchor iron nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This method recycles a portion of pyrolysis products back into the catalyst pool for plastic transformation into new CNTs, reducing the consumption for preparing additional catalysts. The precursors exposed to 50 W microwave irradiation reaches above 2000 °C within seconds, allowing Fe nanoparticles to be uniformly impregnated within the carbon nanotube matrix. The formed iron-doped CNTs shows high activity for microwave-assisted pyrolysis, generating CNTs with D/G ratios at 0.31. The recycling and reconstruction of CNTs after multiple pyrolysis form a cross-lined network structure, which facilitates electron transition and can be utilized for fabricating electrocatalysts. Nitrogen doping further improves the onset potential to 0.923 V vs. RHE, making them viable candidates for electrocatalytic applications in oxygen reduction reactions. In summary, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to reactive pyrolysis products that serve as catalysis for microwave-assisted pyrolysis, with the potential to reduce volatile organic compound emissions and capital expenditure in catalyst preparation, offering a greener and more efficient pathway for plastic waste management and catalyst production.","The study involves microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of resulting carbon nanotubes."
"H2 production by high-temperature pyrolysis of PEEK Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) as an emerging engineering plastic has shown a big potential in recent years to produce Hydrogen (H2) for clean energy through high-temperature pyrolysis. This paper investigates the H2 production capacity and mechanism due to the pyrolysis of PEEK at high temperatures. The results revealed that PEEK has two pyrolysis stages in the temperature ranges of 783–905 K and 905–1173 K respectively. In the first stage, approximately 45 % mass loss was observed with an activation energy of 210.55 kJ/mol. However, only 0.93 mg/g of H2 was produced. According to fourier transform infrared, the main source which generated that H2 is the small amount of H atoms caused by the C-H bonds cracking. The H atoms were then recombined into H2 in the gas phase. The second stage of pyrolysis predominates the productions of H2, with around 11 % mass loss and an activation energy of 411.47 kJ/mol occurred. The H2 yield reaches 9.84 mg/g at 1073 K in this stage. The H2 is mainly generated by dehydrogenation of benzene rings and a small amount of -CH3 and -OH bonds. As the temperature raised, free radicals released by the breakdown of PEEK network recombined, suggesting three potential pathways for H2 production: (1) the dehydrogenation recombination of phenoxybenzene radicals to form dibenzofuran, (2) the recombination of benzene radicals to form biphenyl and naphthalene, and (3) the reaction of phenol and benzene at high temperature to form dibenzofuran, leading to recombination of H atoms into H2. The overall experiment results indicate that the H2 production of PEEK primarily occurs during the high-temperature pyrolysis stages with low mass loss. This finding shed new light on the mechanisms of H2 production and resource utilization of plastics for the future.","The study involves lab-scale high-temperature pyrolysis of PEEK, a commercial engineering plastic, with measurable H2 yields, temperature-dependent product analysis, and detailed characterization of reaction mechanisms and pathways."
"Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and low-density polyethylene: Influence of plastic on pyrolysis product yield The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on plastic during co-pyrolysis with biomass. Pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB), low density polyethylene (LDPE), and their mixtures of different ratios was carried out in a semi-batch reactor with varying temperatures ranging from 350 to 600°C at a heating rate of 20±1°C/min. The maximum liquid product yields for the pyrolysis of SCB and LDPE obtained were 47.15% and 74.40%, respectively, whereas the maximum liquid product yield for SCB/LDPE co-pyrolysis was 52.75% at 500°C with 1:1 blend ratio. A significant improvement of the calorific value has been observed for the co-pyrolytic oil in comparison with SCB pyrolytic oil. The results of GC–MS and FTIR analysis confirmed the interaction between SCB and LDPE during co-pyrolysis, which resulted into a decreasing amount of oxygenated compounds, phenol and acidic compounds, makes the co-pyrolysis process more favorable for the production of high calorific value fuel.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, in a semi-batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR)."

"Recovery of gaseous fuels through CO2-mediated pyrolysis of thermosetting polymer waste Thermosetting polymers are used in a wide range of applications due to their robust mechanical strength and superior flame retardancy. Despite these technical benefits, recycling of thermosetting polymers has been challenging because of their crosslinking nature. Moreover, their disposal through conventional methods (landfill and combustion) poses environmental concerns, such as microplastics and air pollutants. To address these issues, this study introduces a thermo-chemical disposal platform for thermosetting polymer wastes that employs carbon dioxide (CO2) as a reactive medium. In this work, melamine-formaldehyde was used as model compound of thermosetting polymers. In single-stage pyrolysis, it was revealed that CO2 plays a crucial role in controlling in the compositional matrices of pyrolytic gases, liquid products, and wax. These compositional changes were attributed to the homogeneous reactions between CO2 and the volatile compounds released from the thermolysis of MF. To enhance the thermal cracking of the MF, a double-stage pyrolysis process was tested, which increased the production of pyrolytic gases and eliminated wax formation. However, the slow kinetics governing the reactivity of CO2 limits the occurrence of homogeneous reactions. A nickel-based catalyst was used to accelerate reaction kinetics. The catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 conditions led to substantial increases in syngas (H2 and CO) production of 880% and 460%, respectively, compared with double-stage pyrolysis. These findings demonstrate that thermosetting polymer wastes can be valorized into gaseous fuels through thermo-chemical process, and CO2 enhances the recovery of energy and chemicals. Therefore, this study presents an innovative technical platform to convert thermosetting polymer wastes and CO2 into syngas.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of thermosetting polymer waste (melamine-formaldehyde) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and compositional analysis of gases, liquids, and wax under defined reactor conditions."
"Experimental investigation of waste polyolefin composition on thermal conversion into petroleum-derived products Thermal pyrolysis of polyolefins has been proposed as one of the possible ways to obtain petroleum-derived products (fuels and chemicals) from waste plastics however, there is a lack of deep understanding of the correlation between the structure and composition of polyolefin feedstock with pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil has been obtained from polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) in a tubular reactor at 500 °C. TGA-DTG, 13C CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, and XRD were used to analyze the polyolefin (PE and PP) feedstock, while pyrolysis oil was characterized by GC–MS, FTIR, and 1H NMR techniques. The pyrolysis oil from virgin and waste PP yielded branched alphaolefins and cycloparaffins, while virgin and waste PE produce linear alpha olefins and linear paraffins. Mixed waste plastic (MWP) produces major amount of linear paraffins and linear alpha olefins, indicating the overall trend of branching in polyolefins (PE and PP) from feedstock to product oil is retained after pyrolysis. The alpha olefins can be used as chemical intermediates, while 2,4 dimethyl 1-heptene from PP can be used as a fine chemical precursor better feedstock for gasoline. Segregation of waste plastics is challenging task in real life but source segregation and selective collection of waste plastics from various sources can produce useful products like high octane gasoline range hydrocarbons and high-value chemicals.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (PE and PP) with measurable product yields, characterized by GC–MS, FTIR, and NMR, and reports clear product composition and yield relationships."
"Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and black liquor catalyzed by Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 for preparing high-quality bio-oil To solve the long-term environmental pollution caused by black liquor and waste plastics, and achieve high-value utilization, the method about co-pyrolysis of black liquid solid and waste plastics (Polypropylene, Polyethylene) catalyzed by Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 to prepare high-quality bio-oil is studied. The results found that hydrocarbons increased from 14.92% to 42.03% as Polyethylene was co-pyrolyzed with BLS, and hydrocarbons increased from 14.92% to 41.75% as Polypropylene was co-pyrolyzed with BLS, adding plastics can significantly improve the hydrocarbons yield of black liquor. Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 acts as a hydro deoxidizer in the pyrolysis of black liquid and waste plastics, the total hydrocarbons of black liquid solid, black liquid solid& Polypropylene, black liquid solid & Polyethylene increased by 6%, 78%, and 45%, respectively. An appropriate increase of pyrolysis temperature can promote the co-pyrolysis of BLS with PP, and BLS with PE, and can increase the yield of hydrocarbons. Compared with black liquor’s pyrolysis, the yield of hydrocarbons can be increased by 59.65% and 24.52% as Polyethylene or Polypropylene is adapted to pyrolysis with black liquid solid, respectively, the high-quality bio-oil is obtained because of a large number of hydrocarbons and high hydrogen content.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PE) with black liquor using Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst, with measurable product yields, hydrocarbon composition analysis, and temperature–yield relationships reported."
"Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and high-density polyethylene for improving the yield and quality of pyrolysis liquid The overall goal of this research was to study the effects of temperature and pine-to-HDPE ratios on the pyrolysis products. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of pine and HDPE was carried out in a double-column staged reactor, wherein the temperature was varied as 450 °C, 500 °C, and 550 °C for each pine/HDPE ratio of 0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 75/25, and 100/0. Thermal cracking of the feedstock is initiated at the first column, and the zeolitic-based ZSM-5 catalyst offered secondary cracking at a catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 1:1 in the second column of the reactor. Catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE produced 31 wt% pyrolysis oil (40 MJ/kg calorific value) with a selectivity of above 90% toward gasoline-range hydrocarbons at 500 °C. Comparatively, pine offered 26.3% wt.% pyrolysis liquid yield with 7.9% dark pyrolysis oil (30 MJ/kg calorific value) that has a gasoline selectivity of 69.3%. Thus, the addition of HDPE increased the gasoline selectivity by increasing the hydrogen/carbon effective (H/Ceff) ratio. At pine/HDPE ratio of 25/75, the pyrolysis oil content was 22.5% at 500 °C, which is 3 times more than that of pine pyrolysis. The optimum yield and higher gasoline selectivity were observed at 500 °C for 0/100 and 25/75 pine to HDPE ratios.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a waste plastic, with biomass in a staged reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Production of low-aromatic oil from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics-derived wax Chemical recycling of waste plastics into diesel fuel and other precursors that can be used to generate new plastics reduces reliance on conventional fossil energy sources and ensures a circular economy. In this study, we investigated the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics-derived pyrolysis wax (PW) into low-aromatic oil, focusing on naphtha (C5-C12)- and diesel (C13-C22)-range hydrocarbons, by examining the effects of commercial catalysts (i.e., Al2O3, HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3: 50, 80), and HY (SiO2/Al2O3: 60, 80)) and mixed catalysts (i.e., 1CaO/1HY (80), 1MgO/1HY (80), 1CeO2/1HY (80)) on product distribution. The use of catalysts significantly enhanced wax conversion compared to non-catalytic test by facilitating the cracking of long-chain polymers. HY (80) achieved the highest performance with 92.2 wt% wax conversion and 57.2 wt% oil yield, producing oil with the lowest aromatic content (38.6 %) and significant naphtha (45.4 %) and diesel-range (14.7 %) hydrocarbons. This can be attributed to its moderate acidity and well-developed structure among zeolite catalysts. Mixed catalysts, especially 1CeO2/1HY (80), showed improved performance by reducing aromatic selectivity to 20.4 % and increasing the diesel fraction to 23.6 %, while maintaining comparable wax conversion, oil yield, and naphtha production to HY (80). This improvement is attributed to the alkaline and redox properties of CeO2. The enhanced wax conversion and oil yield compared to the theoretical values obtained using binary catalysts, especially 1CeO2/1HY (80), confirmed the synergistic effect of combining metal oxides with HY (80) in producing low-aromatic oil. Examining of various CeO2-to-HY ratios identified 2/1 as the optimal ratio to produce low-aromatic oil. The use of inexpensive and readily available metal oxides with zeolites as mixed catalysts for PW pyrolysis to produce low-aromatic oils provides a commercially viable solution for PW management.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics-derived wax, a plastic feedstock, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of solid wastes (low-density polyethylene and lignocellulosic biomass) over microwave assisted biochar for bio-oil upgrading and hydrogen production Metal catalysts are unavoidable within the process of catalytic pyrolysis, a part of hydrogen production; as a result, the reuse and disposal of these materials are problems that need to be solved. Biochar, with its extensive sources, large specific area, and developed pores, has the potential to be developed in this catalytic area. In this study, we used microwave-assisted corn stover biochar as a catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of Douglas Fir (DF) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in order to investigate its catalytic effects. The results showed that the biochar significantly increased the selectivity of hydrogen (H2) in the syngas, and the highest selectivity that could be achieved was 72 vol% at 650 °C, with a biochar (BC)/feedstock ratio of 4. Furthermore, the application of biochar decreased the wax yield and contributed to the good selectivity of aromatics. The biochar developed in this study was also proven to show good reusability, as even after 10 times of reuses, the biochar still achieved a yield of H2 over 50 vol%.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and lignocellulosic biomass, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition, and reactor conditions reported."
"Insight into co-pyrolysis interactions of Pingshuo coal and high-density polyethylene via in-situ Py-TOF-MS and EPR In-situ detection on primary volatiles interactions and stable radical evolution behaviors during co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal (PC) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were systematically investigated via a novel in-situ pyrolysis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (in-situ Py-TOF-MS) combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. TG results demonstrated that the mixing ratio 7:3 for PC/HDPE has the better positive interaction performances. Accordingly, in-situ Py-TOF-MS results revealed that more short-chain alkenes such as butene and heptadiene are formed in co-pyrolysis, and the addition of HDPE remarkably enhances the transfer of hydrogen (H) to react with the phenoxy group from PC to form diphenol. According to the EPR analysis, HDPE has a remarkable effect on the stable radical concentration (Ng) in PC pyrolysis residue, especially for oxygen (O)-centered and C-centered radicals. Meanwhile, higher temperature is favorable to the generation of O-centered radicals in PC/HDPE (7:3) pyrolysis residue, its radical concentration increases from 3.42 × 1018 to 20.85 × 1018 spins/g. Furthermore, the peak of CO bond exists at a higher temperature, which is consistent with the changes of O-centered radical concentration, and this result can provide effective supplements for understanding the stable radical interactions.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mixed with coal, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent radical behavior, and in-situ analytical data from Py-TOF-MS and EPR."
"Correlation between the as-grown carbon nano tubes and prolonged activity toward hydrogen production over Co–Mo/MgO Novel proposal for the developed highly graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) over Co–Mo/MgO which served as a secondary support toward hydrogen production from low-density polyethylene waste (PE) was presented using two-stage system. Doping of Co3O4 with MoO3 into MgO exposed extra dispersion function through MoO3 and Co, Mo and MgO mixed oxides as well as further distribution of the active cobalt nano particles over the well graphitized thinner MWCNTs. Both of fresh and used Co/MgO and CoMo/MgO catalysts were characterized by XRD, TPR, Raman, TEM and TGA. Furthermore, the concentrations of released hydrogen through the reaction period were detected via online gas chromatography within 150 min. It was found that Mo improved the overall catalyst reducibility to be easier and distributed the active species in different forms of mixed species. Moreover, the catalytic performance toward hydrogen production from low density polyethylene waste was jumped from 51% to 81% after Mo addition within the reaction end. Also, full catalytically action was noticed for CoMo/MgO toward whole the charged hydrocarbon gases from the first decomposition stage without any deactivation. Additionally, the developed multi-walled carbon nanotubes were highly graphitized and more homogenous rather than over Co/MgO which deposited less graphitized carbon nano fibers.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene waste with measurable hydrogen yields, catalyst characterization, and product analysis using experimental methods."
"Investigation of waste-derived and low-cost calcium oxide-based catalysts in co-pyrolysis of EFB-HDPE to produce high quality bio-oil This study evaluated and compared the bio-oil yield produced from the co-pyrolysis of empty fruit bunch (EFB) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) feedstock using four calcium oxide (CaO)-based catalysts. Three catalysts were derived from waste sources, namely, clamshell (CS), eggshell (ES), and chicken bone (CB), whereas Malaysia dolomite (MD) was extracted from limestone. Pure CaO catalyst served as a control experiment for comparison purposes. Surface area (BET), particle size (PSA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) examinations were used to compare all catalysts. BET and PSA demonstrated that waste-derived catalysts (CS, CB, ES) have the properties required for co-pyrolysis to produce good yield and quality of bio-oil, whilst XRD and SEM/EDX revealed the existence of CaO compound in each of the catalysts. The co-pyrolysis of EFB-HDPE was performed under controlled conditions in a fluidized-bed reactor. All co-pyrolysis parameters such as catalyst loading, feedstock loading, gas flow, and temperature were fixed for all reactions. The study explored the effect of each catalyst on the catalytic cracking of EFB-HDPE through the bio-oil yield and hydrocarbon composition from the reaction. The chemical composition of the bio-oil samples was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, whereas the bio-oil yield was calculated using mass-balance equation. The maximum oil yield was 26.07 wt% for ES, whereas pure CaO generated a 52.39% hydrocarbon composition, the highest among all catalysts, followed by ES.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste HDPE and EFB using CaO-based catalysts, with measurable yields, catalyst characterization, and product composition analysis via GC-MS."
"Striking influence of chain structure of polyethylene on the formation of cup-stacked carbon nanotubes/carbon nanofibers under the combined catalysis of CuBr and NiO A one-pot approach was used to convert polyethylene (PE) with different chain structures into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) under the combined catalysis of CuBr and NiO at 700°C, including linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). The effect of chain structure of PE on the yield, morphology, microstructure, phase structure and thermal stability of CNMs, including cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CS-CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs), were investigated by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope (TEM), high-resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. In addition, the degradation products from different chain structures of PE under the catalysis of CuBr were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. It was demonstrated that the branched structure played an important effect in the degradation products of PE. The dehydrogenation and aromatization of LLDPE were remarkably promoted by Br radicals from the decomposition of CuBr to form a large amount of light hydrocarbons and a relatively small amount of aromatics, favoring the formation of long and straight CS-CNTs. However, the degradation of LDPE was not obviously influenced by Br radicals due to its high extent of branched structure, while the random cleavage of HDPE was accelerated with the formation of a lot of olefins with long chains, resulting in the formation of short and winding CNFs. This work will contribute to the conversion of mixed waste polyolefin into high value-added CNMs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (LLDPE, LDPE, HDPE) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of degradation products and carbon nanomaterials."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene in different reactors: Effects of operating conditions on distribution and composition of products The effects of temperature and pressure on product distribution were investigated by catalytic slow pyrolysis of polystyrene in a fixed bed. Simultaneously, the catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene was carried out in a fixed-fluidized bed to study the effects of temperature and reaction time on the product distribution. The slow and fast pyrolysis experiments of polystyrene were conducted using γ- Al2O3 (basic) as catalyst and silica sand as control group. The compositions of oil and gas products were analyzed by GC-FID, GC-MS and GC to investigate the catalytic activity of basic catalyst. The results showed that catalytic slow pyrolysis and catalytic fast pyrolysis achieved maximum oil yields of 94.6 wt% and 92.19 wt%, respectively. In slow pyrolysis, toluene, ethylbenzene, and styrene were the main products, and the introduction of catalyst led to reduced yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and α-methyl styrene. However, the main product of fast pyrolysis was only styrene, with a recycling rate nearly 80% under catalytic conditions. The presence of the catalyst increased the yield of styrene, with slow pyrolysis rising from 27.15% to 32.58%, and fast pyrolysis increasing from 82.28% to 86.56%. Longer residence time strengthened secondary reactions to generate more aromatics such as toluene and ethylbenzene. Both catalytic slow and fast pyrolysis yielded higher styrene contents than thermal pyrolysis because the basic catalyst reduced the occurrence of secondary reactions.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (a commercial plastic) in fixed-bed and fixed-fluidized-bed reactors with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis via GC-FID, GC-MS, and GC."
"Synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of macroalgae and polyvinyl chloride on bio-oil/bio-char properties and transferring regularity of chlorine The present study aimed to investigate synergistic effects on properties of bio-oil/bio-char and transferring regularity of chlorine during co-pyrolysis of macroalgae Enteromorpha clathrata (EN) mixed with different mass percentage of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, and 25 wt%) in a fixed bed reactor at 550 °C. The results showed that the experimental values of bio-oils were 0.43–2.57 wt% lower than the calculated values, while the bio-chars were 1.28–4.93 wt% higher. From the GC–MS analysis of bio-oils, the relative contents of oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds were reduced significantly while those of phenols, aromatic and aliphatic compounds were increased dramatically during co-pyrolysis of EN and PVC. Interaction during co-pyrolysis of EN and PVC decreased the H/C atomic ratio of bio-chars, enhancing the aromatic degree. In addition, the chlorine distribution in bio-chars increased whereas decreased in bio-oils and non-condensable gas with the addition content of PVC increasing. The results showed that a majority of chlorine from EN-PVC blends was trapped in bio-char products, which was favorable to the utilization of bio-oils and friendly to pyrolysis equipment and environment.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastic PVC mixed with macroalgae, with measurable product yields, GC–MS analysis of bio-oil composition, and chlorine distribution data."
"Simultaneous H2 production and dechlorination in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves pyrolysis process with catalysts derived from electroplating sludge Concentrating and extracting functional substances from bulk solid waste and applying them to clean energy conversion is in line with the environmental concept of treating waste with waste. In this study, two catalysts, Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and Nano-NiO/CaO, were prepared by extracting metal elements from electroplating sludge (ES), and the promotional effects of the two catalysts on the H2 yield and HCl removal efficiency in the pyrolysis process of polyvinyl chloride gloves (PVC-G) were investigated. The results showed that under the optimal experimental conditions, In the presence of Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and Nano-NiO/CaO, the H2 production rates were up to 35.18% and 42.18%, respectively, and the enhancement efficiencies for H2 was as high as 173.56% and 228.01%, compared to the H2 production rate without catalyst involvement. Meanwhile, the removal of HCl from pyrolysis syngas by catalysts Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and nano-NiO/CaO was maintained between 80-85%. And there was no significant decreasing trend in cycling performance test.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PVC gloves with measurable H2 yields, HCl removal efficiency, and catalyst performance data."
"Integrating chemical and biological technologies in upcycling plastic waste to medium-chain α,ω-Diacid The growing accumulation of plastic waste poses a pressing environmental challenge. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, carry considerable health and ecological risks. In response, our study presents an innovative method to repurpose mixed plastic waste into valuable α,ω-diacids utilizing chemo-biological processes. We extracted pyrolysis oil, rich in hydrocarbons spanning a broad range of chain lengths (C7 to C32), from household plastic waste and employed a genetically engineered β-oxidation-blocked Candida tropicalis strain to convert this oil into α,ω-diacids of various chain lengths. Simple distillation at 200 °C enabled the extraction of medium-chain hydrocarbons from the pyrolysis oil. However, an increased ratio of medium-chain alkenes posed a toxicity challenge to the cells. Through hydrogenation, these medium-chain alkenes were fully converted to alkanes. Remarkably, cell growth was maintained even with an 8% concentration of hydrogenates. The subsequent biotransformation yielded medium-chain diacids, with 94.3% of the produced α,ω-diacids being of medium-chain length (C7 to C14). These results offer a novel and scalable solution for converting everyday plastic waste into valuable chemicals, thus significantly contributing to the circular economy and the advancement of sustainability goals.","The study involves pyrolysis of household plastic waste to produce hydrocarbon-rich oil, followed by experimental characterization and conversion into valuable chemicals, with measurable yields and defined reactor conditions."
"Co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and spent Li-ion battery cathodes: A combined metallurgy approach to recover valuable metals Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is crucial for the sustainable usage of critical raw materials present in the cathode. The combined metallurgy process is gaining significant attention in achieving this goal. The process includes thermal reduction followed by an environmentally friendly leaching process. In this work, the technological feasibility of a co-pyrolysis method is investigated for the recovery of Li2CO3 and transition metals from Li1-xNiyMnzCo1-y-zO2 (NMC) based cathode black mass (CBM) obtained from spent LiBs. We analyze the performance of polypropylene as a reducing agent during co-pyrolysis at 500 – 650 °C to reduce NMC. During co-pyrolysis, the reductive gases (H2 and CH4) generated from polypropylene reduce NMC at 550 – 650 °C into Ni-Co, MnO, and Li2CO3. However, an additional product, NiO and spinel NMC, appeared in co-pyrolyzed CBM at 500 °C. The magnetic fraction of the co-pyrolysis product was separated by water leaching, and then the leach solution was dried to recover Li2CO3. The lithium leaching efficiency achieved from the cathode black mass of NMC batteries is 92.80 ± 3.22 wt%. A liquid fuel obtained as a by-product of co-pyrolysis has a gross calorific value of 48 MJ/kg. The process promotes sustainability by efficiently reducing NMC at lower temperatures and producing a liquid by-product for fuel applications.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with spent Li-ion battery cathodes, reporting measurable product yields, fuel calorific value, and catalyst-free reduction performance at specific temperatures."
"Acid-catalyzed conversion of chlorinated plastic waste into valuable hydrocarbons over post-use commercial FCC catalysts Plastic waste can be regarded as potentially cheap source of chemicals and energy. A mixture of post-consumer plastic waste (HDPE/LDPE/PP/PVC) was pyrolyzed over cracking catalysts using a fluidizing reaction system similar to the FCC process operating isothermally at ambient pressure. Experiments carried out with various catalysts gave good yields of valuable hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products depending on reaction conditions. A newly developed model is presented that combines kinetic and mechanistic considerations which take into account chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation in the modeling of the catalytic degradation of polymers. Though acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking reactions involve a large number of compounds, reactions and catalyst deactivation and are very complex, the model gives a good representation of experimental results from the degradation of post-consumer plastic waste. This model provides the benefits of lumping product selectivity, in each reaction step, in relation to the performance of the catalyst used and particle size selected as well as the effect of operation conditions, such as rate of fluidizing gas and reaction temperature. The results of this study are useful for the utilization of post-use commercial FCC catalysts for the production of chemicals and hydrocarbons and for determining both the product yield and product distribution from PVC-containing plastic degradation, and specifically for leading to a cheaper process with more valuable products.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste (HDPE/LDPE/PP/PVC) over commercial FCC catalysts with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data.
"Recovery, separation and production of fuel, plastic and aluminum from the Tetra PAK waste to hydrothermal and pyrolysis processes The establishment of a method of separation of materials from Tetra Pak waste to obtain products for use as raw material, fuel or other purposes was investigated in this study. First, the feasibility of hydrothermal treatment for the production of a solid fuel (hydrochar) and solid fraction formed by polyethylene and aluminum, called composite was analyzed. The results indicated that hydrothermal treatment performed at 240 °C yield the formation of hydrochar with good properties for its use as fuel and a composite of polyethylene and aluminum. The best conversion and separation of the cardboard and polyethylene/aluminum were obtained using 120 min as operating time. Then, the recovery of the aluminum fraction from the composite by using spent olive oil waste was studied. A partial separation of the composite layers (polyethylene and aluminum) was accomplished with improved aluminum purity for higher operating temperatures. Finally, the operating conditions of the pyrolysis process for the production of a solid (char) and high purity composite (aluminum) were optimized. The characterization results indicated that both char and aluminum resulting from the pyrolysis of the Tetra Pak at 400 °C still have a significant amount of polyethylene while higher purity levels of aluminum can be obtained at temperatures equal of higher than 500 °C.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of Tetra Pak waste, a mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields and characterization at specific temperatures, including char and aluminum purity results."
"Optimization of fuel recovery through the stepwise co-pyrolysis of palm shell and scrap tire This study optimized the use of biomass waste to generate fuel through co-pyrolysis. In this paper, the effects of stepwise co-pyrolysis temperature and different ratios between palm shells and scrap tires in feedstock were studied to observe any improvements in the quantity and quality of the liquid yield and its byproduct. The ratio of palm shells and scrap tires varied at 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. The experiment was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. The study was divided into two scenarios. The first scenario was performed at the optimum temperature of 500°C with a reaction time of 60min. In the second scenario, the temperature was set at 500°C for 60min before the temperature was increased to 800°C with a high heating rate. After the temperature reached 800°C, the condition was maintained for approximately 45min. Results showed that an increase in the liquid and gas yields was achieved when the temperature increased after optimum conditions. Increased yield was also obtained when the proportion of scrap tire was increased in the feedstock. Several other important findings are discussed in this paper, including the phases of pyrolysis oil, features of the liquid product, and characteristics of the byproducts. All products from both scenarios were analyzed by various methods to understand their fuel characteristics.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of scrap tire (a waste plastic) and palm shell, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Plastic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 zeolite and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst under ultra-fast heating Plastic pollution compromises the environment and human well-being, and a global transition to a circular economy of plastics is vital to address this challenge. Pyrolysis is a key technology for the end-of-life recycling of plastics, although high energy consumption limits the economic feasibility of the process. Various research has shown that the application of induction heating in biomass pyrolysis reduces energy consumption when compared to conventional heating. Nevertheless, the potential of induction heating in plastic pyrolysis is rarely explored. This paper presents an exploratory study on the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene in a fixed bed reactor through induction heating. An MFI-type HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 23) and an FAU-type spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst with distinctive Brønsted acidity and textural properties were used. A complete conversion of the plastic feedstocks was achieved within 10 min, even without a catalyst. Thermal pyrolysis produced wax (72.4–73.9 wt%) and gas products, indicating a limited degree of polymer cracking. Catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5 and FCC catalyst significantly improved polymer cracking, leading to higher gas (up to 75.2 wt%) and liquid product (up to 35.9 wt%) yields at the expense of wax yield (up to 25.4 wt%). In general, the gas products were rich in C3 and C4 compounds. The liquid product composition was highly dependent on the catalyst properties, for example, the HZSM-5 produced high aromatics, while the FCC catalyst produced high alkenes in the liquid products. The catalyst acidity and textural properties played an essential role in plastic pyrolysis within the short reaction time. This study demonstrated the feasibility of a fast, energy-efficient, and versatile plastic valorization technology based on the application of induction heating, where the plastic feed can be converted into wax, gas, and liquid products depending on the end-use applications.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP) using fixed-bed reactors with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled with nanocatalyst and pyrolysis oil produced from the solid plastic waste using screw reactor In recent years, the concerns of non-biodegradable mixed plastic waste have been growing and resulting in strengthening of technologies devoted to convert waste into energy. This study examined the technique to extract plastic oil from mixed plastic, non-biodegradable waste. Further, the mechanical characteristics of plastic pyrolysis oil were done. Pyrolysis method was used to extract the oil from plastic waste with screw reactor and the chemical compounds and the characterization of this oil was analyzed. The Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 was dispersed to enhance the quality of Waste pyrolysis oil (PO) by ultrasonication. The performance and emission characteristics of various fuels at different load conditions were analyzed by conducting a series of tests in single cylinder 4 stroke water cooled diesel engine. The benefit of the addition of 25 ppm of Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 in PO was represented graphically. A series of tests was conducted for various brake mean effective pressure of 1.3 bar, 2.6 bar, 3.9 bar and 5.2 bar for the test blends, PO (neat pyrolysis oil) and P25A (25% PO+ 75% diesel with 25 ppm of Al2O3). From the procured results, the addition of the novel nanoparticles increases the production of brake power by 35% with reduced emission of 45% and 60% of HC and CO2 respectively. On the other hand, the NOx emission was reduced by 15% and 9 % than the neat plastic oil and diesel fuel. Further, the usage of the pyrolysis oil at 25% generated the positive effects on both combustion and emission compared to neat PO.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste using a screw reactor, reports measurable product yields and fuel engine test results, and includes experimental characterization of pyrolysis oil and catalyst performance."
"Thermochemical recycling of polystyrene waste by pyrolysis using a pilot-scale auger reactor: Process demonstration in a relevant environment This study presents the pyrolysis of polystyrene waste using a single-auger pyrolysis reactor at an industrially relevant scale, i.e. within the fifth technology readiness level (TRL-5). In order to gain a better understanding of the influence of the main variables involved in this technology, a thorough experimental campaign was performed with PS feed rates of 6 and 9 kg/h, covering a temperature range of 450–600 °C. These variables influence not only the distribution of the products, but also the presence of compounds that may affect the suitability of the pyro-oil for re-polymerisation processes. In this sense, gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and simulated distillation (SimDist) of the resulting pyro-oils provided valuable insights into styrene purification.

"Carbon nanotubes production from real-world waste plastics and the pyrolysis behaviour The investigation of the pyrolysis behaviour of real-world waste plastics (RWWP) and using them as the feedstock to produce carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could serve as an effective solution to address the global waste plastics catastrophe. This research aimed to characterize the pyrolysis behaviour of RWWP via thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and fast pyrolysis-TG/mass spectrometry (Py-TG/MS) analyses. Activation energies (131.04 kJ mol−1 –171.04 kJ mol−1) for RWWP pyrolysis were calculated by three methods: Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method, and Starink method. Py-TG/MS results indicated that the RWWP could be identified as polystyrene (RWWP-1), polyethylene (RWWP-2), polyethylene terephthalate (RWWP-3, 4), and polypropylene (RWWP-5, 6). In addition, RWWP-1, 2, 5, 6 outperform RWWP-3 and 4 as sources of carbon for producing CNTs. The results showed a high carbon yield of 32.21 wt% and a high degree of CNT purity at 93.04%.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real-world waste plastics (e.g., PE, PP, PS, PET) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization including TG, Py-TG/MS, and CNT yield/purity data."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of harmful plastic waste to alleviate environmental impacts Wax is a detrimental byproduct of plastic waste pyrolysis causing challenges upon its release into the environment owing to persistence and potential toxicity. In this study, the valorization of wax materials through conversion into BTEX (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) was achieved via catalytic pyrolysis using zeolite-based catalysts. The potential of two types of waxes, spent wax (SW), derived from the pyrolysis of plastic waste, and commercial paraffin wax (PW), for BTEX generation, was investigated. Using HZSM-5, higher yields of oil (54.9 wt%) and BTEX (18.2 wt%) were produced from the pyrolysis of SW compared to PW (32.3 and 14.1 wt%, respectively). This is due to the improved accessibility of lighter hydrocarbons in SW to Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in HZSM-5 micropores, promoting cracking, isomerization, cyclization, Diels-Alder, and dehydrogenation reactions. Further, the use of HZSM-5 resulted in significantly larger yields of oil and BTEX from SW pyrolysis compared to Hbeta and HY. This phenomenon is ascribed to the well-balanced distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites and the identical geometric structure of HZSM-5 micropores and BTEX molecules. The addition of Ga to HZSM-5 further led to 2.24% and 28.30% enhancements in oil and BTEX yields, respectively, by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst through the introduction of new Lewis acid sites. The regeneration of the Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst by removing deposited coke on the spent catalyst under air partially recovered catalytic activity. This study not only offers an efficient transformation of undesirable wax into valuable fuels but also provides an environmentally promising solution, mitigating pollution, contributing to carbon capture, and promoting a healthier and more sustainable environment. It also suggests future research directions, including catalyst optimization and deactivation management, feedstock variability exploration, and techno-economic analyses for sustainable wax conversion into BTEX via catalytic pyrolysis.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste-derived wax, a byproduct of plastic pyrolysis, using zeolite-based catalysts to produce BTEX, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Microwave-assisted fast co-pyrolysis behaviors and products between microalgae and polyvinyl chloride Microwave-assisted fast co-pyrolysis of microalgae (MA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was investigated. The pyrolysis profiles, yields of three-phase, the chemical composition of liquid and the ultimate analyses of solid residues were studied. When the power increased from 800 W to 1000 W, the bio-oil yields increased significantly while the proportion of aromatics and the heating value of oil and char decreased. A remarkable synergistic effect between MA and PVC was achieved in terms of oil yield when MA to PVC ratios were 5:5 and 3:7 at 800 W and 5:5 at 1000 W, respectively. With the increase of PVC, the content of nitrogenous and oxygenous organic matter in oil decreased from 29.65% to 0.38% at 800 W. The yield of solid decreased, the HHV increased and the values of H/C had a wave change. According to the quantity and quality of liquid and solid, 30% percentage of PVC was the suitable ratio.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) mixed with microalgae, with measurable product yields, chemical composition analysis, and reactor condition effects reported."
"Pyrolysis of waste polystyrene into transportation fuel: Effect of contamination on oil yield and production at pilot scale This study investigated the pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) packaging waste for transportation fuel application of the oil product, with a specific focus on the effect of contamination and the scale-up of the process. The oil yield and calorific value were optimised at bench scale in a semi-batch reactor with temperature and heating rate as input factors. The process was then scaled up to a semi-continuous rotary kiln reactor and the oil product was characterised in terms of fuel properties. Oil yields of 89.8–93.2 wt% with higher heating values (HHV) of 42.1 ± 0.5 MJ/kg were achieved at bench scale with virgin PS. Heavy meat juice contamination (15.9 wt% dry contamination) decreased the oil yield by 6.4 wt%, but did not affect the HHV significantly. Due to more losses at pilot scale, a lower oil yield of 82.5 ± 1.4 wt% was achieved and the gross energy recovered in the oil was 88.0 ± 2.6%. Fuel characterisation indicated that the oil contained substantially less inorganic and sulphur than the waste feedstock. However, for commercial use, blending with conventional fuel would be necessary to mitigate the aromatic content of the oil.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polystyrene (PS) with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and reactor condition analysis."
"Comparative study of continuous-stirred and batch microwave pyrolysis of linear low-density polyethylene in the presence/absence of HZSM-5 A continuous-stirred microwave pyrolysis (CSMP) reactor was designed for linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) conversion. Its performance was compared with the batch microwave pyrolysis (BMP) under identical conditions. During the pyrolysis, the continuous-stirred system generated more condensate products with higher selectivity in long carbon chains (C14–C20), whereas the batch system was more selective for gas products with a higher proportion of methane. An ex-situ catalytic bed with HZSM-5 was assembled to upgrade pyrolysis vapors, corresponding to improved gasoline-range hydrocarbons and propylene production. The comparison of catalytic processes showed similar product yields for both configurations, with differences primarily on chemical species selectivity. For instance, the products from the continuous-stirred system had narrower carbon number distribution (C7–C10) and higher selectivity to mono-aromatics (72.3%). The proposed pathways for LLDPE conversion from the two systems showed slight differences in the thermal cracking process but similarities in the catalytic cracking process. During the catalytic processes, the potential net energy gain was 34.16 MJ/kg for CSMP and −38.86 MJ/kg for BMP, compared with the non-catalytic processes, when the figures were 9.85 MJ/kg and −42.86 MJ/kg, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastic LLDPE using microwave reactors with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Partial removal of Al2O3 enhanced production of aromatic hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis of waste lithium-ion battery separators A new method for the sustainable utilization of waste lithium-ion battery separators was developed, involving the hydrochloric acid washing to partially remove the Al2O3 coating, followed by catalytic pyrolysis to produce aromatic hydrocarbons with HZSM-5. The separators composed of polyethylene as base film were selected as the feedstock. The effects of acid washing pretreatment on the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis characteristics of the separators were studied. The results showed that the partial removal of Al2O3 coating not only enhanced the heat and mass transfer, improving the primary thermal decomposition of organic matter and increasing the formation of volatiles, but also promoted the contact between volatiles and Al2O3, resulting in the cracking of large molecular substances into small molecular olefins. This pretreatment process was conducive to the production of aromatic hydrocarbons during the catalytic pyrolysis over HZSM-5. The aromatic hydrocarbons yield, calculated based on the ash-free separator, reached a maximum value of 83.20 wt% under conditions of 1.5 mol/L hydrochloric acid concentration and a catalyst/separator ratio of 12 at 650℃. This yield surpassed the yields of 59.24 wt% from untreated separator and 64.39 wt% from pure polyethylene separator.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste lithium-ion battery separators composed of polyethylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields of aromatic hydrocarbons and detailed experimental conditions and product analysis."
"Low-cost activated carbon from the pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste and the application in CO2 capture Chemical recycling by pyrolysis of plastic waste has been considered a potential approach. However, little attention has been paid to the reuse of the char residue generated. The preparation of materials from char residue obtained from the pyrolysis process has become an essential task. The purpose of this work is the preparation of activated carbons from the resulting char from the pyrolysis of a dirty and wet mixture of post-consumer plastic waste. The porous materials have been applied to the adsorption of CO2. Both physical and chemical activation methods were investigated to modify the surface texture properties. The properties of the developed activated carbons were characterized by diverse techniques such as elemental and proximate analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), adsorption-desorption isotherms with N2, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Among all synthesized samples, the activated samples prepared by chemical activation with KOH (char: KOH ratio 2:1; surface area, 487.0 m2·g−1) exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption uptake (∼49 mg·g−1). The activation temperature was explored within 680–840 ºC. For physical activation, an increase in the activation temperature decreases the adsorption uptake of the samples. For chemical activation, the adsorption increased as activating temperature rise to a maximum value, subsequently decreasing with further temperature rise. Increasing the amount of the chemical activating agent significantly decreases the adsorption capacities. The best-activated carbon was chosen, and several parameters were investigated on CO2 adsorption, C: KOH mass ratio (6:1–1:4), and adsorption temperature (15–60 °C). The highest adsorption of CO2 achieved was 62.0 mg·g−1 for activated carbon operating at the lower adsorption temperature (15 ºC).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste, with measurable product yields, activation temperature effects, and detailed characterization of char-derived activated carbon."
"Fermentation-pyrolysis of fibre waste from a paper recycling mill for the production of fuel products A range of energy fuels (ethanol, char, oil/wax and gas) was produced from fibre waste contaminated with plastic through the application of a fermentation-pyrolysis route. The fibre component was first converted to ethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), achieving an ethanol concentration of 39.8 g/L. The residue, enriched in lignin and plastics, was subjected to fast pyrolysis at temperatures between 350 and 550 °C. A wax product with a higher heating value (HHV) higher than 28 MJ/kg was obtained for temperatures higher than 450 °C, while values lower than 15 MJ/kg were observed for the oils produced from the untreated waste stream. Pyrolysis at 550 °C produced a wax with an HHV as high as 32.1 MJ/kg, where 51.8% of the energy content of the fermentation residue was transferred. The attractive energy contents of the pyrolysis products were enabled by oxygen removal from the feedstock during fermentation to ethanol.","The study involves pyrolysis of plastic-contaminated fibre waste, a form of mixed plastic waste, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and fuel properties such as HHV."
"Two-stage thermal pyrolysis of plastic solid waste: Set-up and operative conditions investigation for gaseous fuel production In response to the escalating global challenge of mounting plastic waste and the imperative to adopt more sustainable practices for resource utilization, our study focuses on the utilization of plastic solid waste (PSW) through a two-stage thermal pyrolysis process. This aims to demonstrate its potential as a high-performance alternative to existing two-stage catalytic pyrolysis methods. The experimentation involved processing real scrap PSW material in a lab-scale batch set-up, emphasizing optimizing residence time in the cracking reactor to maximize gas yield and its lower heating value (LHV). The study underscores the advantages of the employed two-stage thermal pyrolysis apparatus through a comparative analysis with established set-up dedicated to maximizing gas yield. Once the operative conditions were explored, resulting pyrolysis products underwent detailed characterization to assess their suitability as a sustainable fuel source. The study also presents a practical application of the produced gaseous fuel, envisioning its combustion in an internal combustion engine (ICE), known for its flexibility regarding fuel properties. This application is demonstrated through a simulation conducted in Unisim Design©. The successful processing of real PSW material in the two-stage lab-scale experimental set-up showcased optimal gas yield achievements (>65 % w/w) with an LHV (∼41 MJ/kg), comparable to that of natural gas. This emphasizes the potential of these sustainable alternatives to replace fossil fuels, especially in the context of ICE applications. The integration of the pyrolysis plant with an ICE demonstrated promising prospects for generating electricity in the transportation sector and facilitating thermal power for heat integration in pyrolysis reactors.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real plastic solid waste with measurable product yields, gas composition, and fuel performance data, including LHV and engine simulation."
"Production of value-added liquid fuel via microwave co-pyrolysis of used frying oil and plastic waste The production of household wastes such as used frying oil (UFO) and plastic waste (PW) are increasing each year, thus representing potential feedstocks for conversion into an energy source. Microwave co-pyrolysis was investigated for its potential to transform a mixture of UFO and polyolefinic-based plastic waste into fuel product with desirable properties. The co-pyrolysis approach demonstrated positive synergistic effects in providing fast heating rate (up to 50 °C/min) and a lower reaction time (≤25 min), and generated up to 81 wt.% yield of liquid oil and 18 wt.% yield of pyrolysis gases for use as potential fuels. The liquid oil showed promising green properties comprising low oxygen content, free of nitrogen and sulphur and higher energy content (42–46 MJ/kg). The oil product also demonstrated improved stability and desirable fuel properties nearly similar to transport-grade diesel, thus indicating the great potential of microwave co-pyrolysis as an approach for transforming household wastes into value-added liquid fuel.","The study involves lab-scale microwave co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and used frying oil, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and fuel properties reported."
"Recycling of waste plastics into fuels. LDPE conversion in FCC In order to study the tertiary recycling of waste polymers in standard FCC units low density polyethylene (LDPE) was dissolved into a commercial vacuum gas oil at 2 and 6wt.% and converted over two equilibrium FCC catalysts of the octane-barrel and resid types in a CREC Riser Simulator laboratory reactor. The reaction temperatures were 500, 525 and 550°C, the mass catalyst to oil relationship was 6.35 and the contact times were from 3 to 30s. The study included the effect of the concentration of LDPE over conversion, the various product (dry gas, LPG, gasoline, LCO and coke) yields and selectivities. Results were very similar for the two concentrations. At typical conversions of 70wt.%, dry gas and gasoline yields increased about 10wt.%, LPG yields between 9 and 13wt.%, LCO yields decreased more than 15wt.% and coke yields were lower than 7.7wt.% The RON index of gasoline was improved slightly (up to one point), mainly due to significant increases in olefin concentrations, while the fuel quality of the LCO cut was not affected. LDPE is easily converted and seems to be subjected to primary reactions of catalytic cracking, thus increasing the yields of olefins in the LPG and gasoline boiling ranges. It was concluded that recycling waste LDPE by co-processing it as part of conventional feeds to the FCC would not interfere with the standard operation.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste LDPE in an FCC reactor with measurable product yields, temperature effects, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and cellulose: Synergies during devolatilization and condensation The nature and mechanisms of synergistic effects observed during the co-pyrolysis of cellulose and low density polyethylene (LDPE), two major components in municipal solid wastes, were investigated at milligram and gram-scales. Pyrolysis of a mixture of LDPE and cellulose increased the yield of the liquid product, with an 83% increase in the energy recovery, compared to a mixture of the liquid products from pyrolysis of the individual components. Further experiments distinguished the synergistic effects during devolatilization and condensation, respectively. Synergism during devolatilization was investigated by mixing cellulose char (prepared at 400°C) with LDPE, and resulted in an increase in liquid yield, indicating an interaction between char and LDPE to promote liquid production. Solid-gas and/or gas-gas interactions occurred, where in the former the char acted as a catalyst rather than a reactant. For synergistic effects during the condensation process, LDPE was pyrolysed and the hot volatiles were condensed while the liquid products of cellulose pyrolysis were present in the condensation system, which also increased the liquid yield. Gas-gas and/or gas-liquid interactions occurred during condensation which enhanced the formation of the liquid phase. Moreover, the sum of the synergisms during devolatilization and condensation was similar to the overall synergistic effects observed during co-pyrolysis of the mixture, confirming the contribution of both to the overall positive synergistic effect on the liquid yield.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of LDPE and cellulose, with measurable product yields and analysis of synergistic effects during devolatilization and condensation."
"Influence of waste plastic on pyrolysis of low-lipid microalgae: A study on thermokinetics, behaviors, evolved gas characteristics, and products distribution In this study, co-pyrolysis of low-lipid Nannochloropsis sp. (NS) and waste polystyrene (PS) was deeply investigated using TG-MS-FTIR and Fixed bed reactor to characterize their thermal behaviors, kinetics, evolved gases, and products distribution. The (D)TG investigation of the co-pyrolysis process revealed two distinct stages of thermal decomposition: the first stage (150–420 °C) was mostly caused by NS decomposition, whereas the second stage (420–550 °C) was attributed to NS-PS decomposition. The difference between experimental and theoretical mass loss (ΔW) was lower than zero when the proportion of NS was 75% and 65%. In addition, the average activation energy of the blends containing 75% and 65% of NS was less than sole NS. Thus, based on thermal behaviors and activation energies, the blends with an NS content of 75% and 65% exhibited the strongest synergistic effect. The results of TG-MS, TG-FTIR, and GC-MS analyses revealed that the co-pyrolysis considerably boosted the production of hydrocarbons, notably aromatic hydrocarbons, while concurrently restricting the production of nitrogenous and oxygenous compounds. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the utilization of low-lipid microalgae.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polystyrene (PS) with low-lipid microalgae using a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization including GC-MS, TG-MS, and TG-FTIR."
"Investigation of high-density polyethylene pyrolyzed wax for asphalt binder modification: Mechanism, thermal properties, and ageing performance The thermal pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a fixed bed reactor has been studied in the temperature range of 450–550 °C with two different nitrogen carrier gas flowrates, 2 and 4nullLnullmin−1, to study the effect of these process parameters as well as the resultant vapour residence times on the formation of wax and its chemical and thermal properties. The technology had a high selectivity to waxes, with a yield of up to 91.87% wax from high-density polyethylene at 500 °C using a nitrogen carrier gas flowrate of 4nullLnullmin−1 and subsequent 1.76 second vapour residence time, calculated using the ideal gas law. The waxes were characterised using techniques including gas-chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The process operating temperature especially and its subsequent effect on vapour residence times within the reactor had a considerable impact on both the chemical and thermal properties of the waxes. Higher operating temperatures yielded more olefinic waxes due to the promotion of degradation radical mechanisms such as β-scission. They were observed to have higher melting points and thermal stability. An investigation was conducted to assess the thermal properties and ageing performance of the waxes. Thermal conditioning in an ashing oven at 170 °C for 0–6 hours was conducted with a detailed analysis of GC-MS and FTIR at each stage of thermal exposure to further support thermal characterisation results. The changes in chemical composition were attributed mainly to oxidation and polymerization ageing reactions and were seen to be more prominent in the more unsaturated waxes produced at higher pyrolysis temperatures. The wax produced at 550 °C was determined the optimal wax for binder modification in hot-mix asphalt pavement design due to lower volatile/mass loss. A lower temperature range was suggested for optimal blending conditions to further reduce loss of volatiles with initial blending and storage.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Upgrading bio-oil production via catalytic co-pyrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunch and low-density polyethylene using clinoptilolite catalyst The cost-effective upgradation of pyrolysis oil is a significant challenge that hinders the commercial production of biomass biofuels. This research aimed to enhance bio-oil production by co-feeding low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with palm oil empty fruit bunch (EFB) waste using a natural clinoptilolite catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor. The impact of pyrolysis temperature and the catalyst-to-feedstock (C/F) ratio on the yields and chemical composition of the bio-oil were examined. Clinoptilolite significantly enhanced the yield of the bio-oil as well as its chemical composition. The maximum yield of bio-oil (72.6 %) with a yield of hydrocarbons (77.6 %) were attained at 500 °C, using a C/F mass ratio of 0.2. Liquid oil produced using clinoptilolite catalyst exhibited a high heating value (HHV) (44.2MJ/kg), which is comparable to conventional diesel.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (plastic) and biomass in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, temperature effects, and product characterization."
"Tandem pyrolysis catalytic reforming of plastic waste to high-yield monocyclic aromatics by one-step microwave catalysis The recycling and processing of plastic waste to promote resource sustainability has emerged as a global concern. Selectivily upcycling polyolefins into valuable monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) is a promising strategy to promote a circular economy but limited by low yield and selectivity. In this study, one-step microwave-triggered tandem pyrolysis coupling ZSM-5 catalytic reforming technology was explored, which is efficient for selectively transforming plastic into benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) riched oil products. Pyrolysis and catalytic processes were achieved by mixing plastic and ZSM-5 with graphite, respectively, and placing them in the bottom and top layers of the reactor. Results indicate the mass ratio of plastic or ZSM-5 to graphite and microwave irradiation power would influence the selectivity and yield of MAHs. After careful investigation, the optimum reaction conditions are deemed to be 600 W, and the mass ratio of LDPE and ZSM-5 to graphite is 3:1 and 1:1, respectively, and delightful selectivity and yield of MAHs of 82.06% and 28.12 wt% are obtained under the above conditions. More importantly, the BTEX accounted for a significant amount in the MAHs with the selectivity and yield of 70.53% and 24.17 wt%, demonstrating a strong ability to produce high-value BTEX, which is attributed to the ZSM-5 providing a sufficient active site for reforming the pyrolysis vapors and promote the formation of BTEX by cracking, aromatization and Diels-Alder reactions. Additionally, gas products are rich in C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 olefin monomers accounting for around 60% of the gas products, which also manifest high value. Besides, the ZSM-5 can be stabilized by exceeding three successive cycles, and this strategy is also suitable for the catalytic upcycling of PP and mixed plastics to produce MAHs selectively. Therefore, this one-step microwave-triggered tandem pyrolysis coupling ZSM-5 catalytic reforming technology provides a potential waste resource utilization method to convert plastic waste into high-value petrochemical products.","The study involves microwave-driven pyrolysis of LDPE and mixed plastics with ZSM-5 catalysis, achieving measurable yields and selectivity of monocyclic aromatics, with explicit reactor setup, temperature/power conditions, and product analysis."
"Processing of mixed-plastic waste to fuel oil, carbon nanotubes and hydrogen using multi–core reactor Conversion of mixed–plastic waste into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen–rich hydrocarbon gases was carried out in a multi–core reactor using Ni/Mo/MgO catalyst. The mixed plastic waste consisted of HDPE (67.2wt%), PP (11.2wt%), PS (6.2wt%), PVC (5.2wt%) and PET (10.2wt%). Optimization of process parameters such as pyrolysis temperature, CNT synthesis temperature, reaction time and recycle ratio were carried out using Box–Behnken 3–level and 4–factorial design method. The result shows that CNTs of 6.63g and hydrocarbon gases containing 78% hydrogen would yield using 60g plastic waste and 1g of catalyst. Recycle ratio and pyrolysis temperature have shown the considerable effect over the yield of CNTs and product gases. The HRTEM analysis indicates that CNTs with aligned graphene walls can be produced at 50% recycle ratio, while 70% recycle ratio produces CNTs with bamboo like structure. High recycle ratio results in an increase of CO/CO2 concentration with reduction of CNTs and hydrogen yield.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (HDPE, PP, PS, PVC, PET) using a multi-core reactor with measurable yields of CNTs, hydrogen-rich gases, and analytical characterization of products."
"Kinetic study of low-temperature conversion of plastic mixtures to value added products Batch-mode pyrolysis of 200.0g samples of polymers was studied at low temperature. The cracking reaction was carried out in a stainless-steel autoclave with reaction temperatures of 360, 380, 400 and 420°C, initial pressure of 6.325kPa (absolute pressure) and reaction times of 0–240min. Based on the experimental results, a four-lump kinetic model has been developed to describe the production distribution of the light fractions, middle distillates and heavy fraction. This model reasonably fitted the results in each reaction of operation conditions. It was also found that the pyrolysis kinetics of separated plastic, mixed plastic and mixed plastic containing additives can be described by the same kinetic model. The plastic additives have not had a great influence on the product distribution and kinetics of the mixed plastic pyrolysis. Finally, the optimum conditions of low-temperature conversion of plastic mixtures to value-added products were established. The formation of heavy fractions from HDPE was as high as 70wt% at 380°C at a reaction time of 250min. During the thermal degradation of plastic mixtures, the heavy fractions yielded up 50wt% for 30min reaction time at 400°C. The total activation energies for the conversion of HDPE and the plastic mixtures were estimated to be 217.66kJmol−1 and 178.49kJmol−1, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastic mixtures at specified temperatures and times, with measurable product yields, kinetic modeling, and analytical characterization of products and reactions."
"Analysis of liquid products and mechanism of thermal/catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene Rapid thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) were carried out using Py-GC/MS. The distribution of products of rapid pyrolysis and the influence of FCC catalyst on pyrolysate production were studied both qualitatively and quantitatively at the temperature of 500 °C. The corresponding reaction pathways were suggested based on the experimental results. The results showed that the olefin content of PP cracking products exceeded 99 wt. %, which were monoolefines with carbon number of 3n and diolefins with carbon number of 3n+1, respectively, and only a very small amount of alkanes. The catalyst promoted the formation of monolefine and decreased the content of diolefin. With the addition of catalyst, the content of small molecular weight monolefine between C9 and C21 increased by 13.6 wt. %, while the diolefin content of C15+ decreased to varying degrees. The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of PP can be reasonably explained using free radical mechanism and carbonium ion mechanism, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene using Py-GC/MS, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Flash co-pyrolysis of biomass with polylactic acid. Part 1: Influence on bio-oil yield and heating value High amounts of water present in bio-oil are one of the major drawbacks for its utilisation as a fuel. One technology that shows the potential to satisfy the demand for bio-oil with a reduced water content is the flash co-pyrolysis of biomass with polylactic acid, PLA. The influence of PLA on the pyrolysis of willow is investigated with a semi-continuous home-built pyrolysis reactor. Flash co-pyrolysis of willow/PLA blends (10:1, 3:1, 1:1 and 1:2) show synergetic interaction. A higher bio-oil yield and a lower water content as a function of the willow/PLA ratios are obtained. Among the tested blends, the 1:2 willow/PLA blend shows the most pronounced synergy: a reduction in the production of pyrolytic water of almost 28%, accompanied by an increase of more than 37% in the production of water-free bio-oil. Additionally, PLA shows to have a positive influence on the energetic value of the bio-oil produced and on the resulting energy recuperation.","The study involves lab-scale flash co-pyrolysis of polylactic acid (PLA), a commercial plastic, with biomass, including measured product yields, water content reduction, and energy value improvements, with clear experimental data and reactor operation."
"Valorization of food waste impurities by catalytic co-pyrolysis for production of pyrolysis oil with high energy potential The emerging impurities (plastic, chopsticks, eggshell and bones) in food waste (FW) due to inefficient source separation have hindered the sustainable treatment and valorization of FW. This study evaluated pyrolysis for converting FW with and without different impurities to produce pyrolysis oil (py-oil). The optimal yield of total condensable vapor (py-liquid) of 37.52 wt% from pure FW was achieved at 400 °C, 20 °C/min and 20 min. Different FW impurities demonstrated varieties of relative content of hydrocarbon (35.53 wt% − 58.03 wt%). The introduction of polypropylene, eggshells and bones improved the organic fraction of py-liquid from 6.5 wt% to 10.7 wt%. Polypropylene enhanced the selectivity of hydrocarbons, while other impurities reduced the hydrocarbon selectivity. Adding treated eggshells and activated biochar as catalysts significantly increased aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon production with higher heating values (HHV) ranging from 36 MJ/kg - 44.44 MJ/kg. The C-H and C-O ratio of py-oil indicated that py-oil has the potential to be processed and utilized like conventional liquid fuel.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of food waste containing plastic impurities (e.g., polypropylene) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and fuel properties including HHV and hydrocarbon composition."
"Weakening the strong Fe-La interaction in A-site-deficient perovskite via Ni substitution to promote the thermocatalytic synthesis of carbon nanotubes from plastics The variation of metal-support interaction (MSI) plays a key role in the synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based on chemical vapor deposition process. This work concentrates on weakening the interaction of Fe-La in an A-site-deficient perovskite (La0.8FeO3-δ) via Ni partial substitution. After reductive treatment, the catalysts were employed for thermocatalytic synthesis of CNTs from plastics. Following the structural, morphological and chemical changes, the catalytic activities of the reductive La0.8NixFe1-xO3-δ (H-LNxF1-x, x = 0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) were correlated with the degree of MSI. Compared with H-LF sample, the H-LN0.15F0.85 sample exhibited the highest catalytic activity, which was attributable to the highest surface coverage of metals as well as the synergistic effect of Fe and Ni species. The yield of CNTs produced from low density polyethylene was 1.44 g/gcatalyst over the H-LN0.15F0.85 sample, which was much higher than that over H-LF sample (0.38 g/gcatalyst).","The study involves thermocatalytic synthesis of carbon nanotubes from low density polyethylene, a waste plastic, using a catalyst in a laboratory-scale reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data."
"Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of organosolv lignin and polypropylene over in-situ red mud and ex-situ HZSM-5 in two-step catalytic micro reactor The additional use of red mud (RM) on the catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (CFCP) of organosolv lignin (OL) and polypropylene (PP) over ex-situ HZSM-5 was investigated using a tandem micro reactor system. Non-catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of OL and PP increased their decomposition efficiency owing to the effective interactions. The in-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of OL over RM led to the enhanced conversion of large molecular OL pyrolyzates with the additional production of aromatic hydrocarbons. The in-situ CFCP of OL/PP over RM resulted in a further increase in the cracking efficiency of OL/PP pyrolyzates as well as an increase in the aromatics formation efficiency owing to the effective interactions between their CFP intermediates. Furthermore, the application of RM in 1st in-situ catalytic reactor was found to be the optimal catalyst system because the in-situ CFCP of OL/PP over RM can enhance the formation of the proper hydrocarbons precursors for the production of aromatics over ex-situ HZSM-5 in 2nd reactor. Compared to the one-step CFCP of OL/PP over ex-situ HZSM-5, two-step CFCP of OL/PP over in-situ RM and ex-situ ZSM-5 maintained the higher aromatics formation during the 7 times sequential reaction due to the slow deactivation of ex-situ HZSM-5.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with organosolv lignin in a tandem micro reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and aromatic hydrocarbon formation analyzed."
"The pyrolysis and combustion of polyoxymethylene in a fluidised bed with the possibility of incorporating CO2 The recycling of polyoxymethylene (POM) was performed in a fluidised bed which was formed from cenospheres (hollow, spherical particles). Air, N2 and CO2 were used as the fluidising agents. The composition of the process products in the flue gases as a function of fluidised bed temperature is shown and discussed for each fluidising gas. A flue gases FTIR analysis together with the spectra deconvolution of multicomponent gaseous samples were used to conduct instant quantitative monitoring of the products of POM thermal degradation. At 400 °C, in atmospheres of either air or CO2, the process of POM thermal recycling was performed for the purpose of monomer recovery and obtained a near 90% efficiency of formaldehyde formation. At temperatures above 600 °C, it was found that the use of air or N2 leads to the recovery of energy or gas rich in CO, respectively. The CO-rich gas was obtained during the pyrolysis of POM when CO2 constituted the fluidising agent. The amount of CO in the flue gas was almost twice as large as the amount of carbon introduced into the process in the polymer material. This means that carbon was converted to CO from the fluidising medium, thus recycling of POM to the CO-rich feedstock was obtained with a negative CO2 emission. The main advantage of the POM pyrolysis in the nitrogen atmosphere was monomer recovery.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized-bed pyrolysis of polyoxymethylene (POM), a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent product analysis via FTIR, and quantifiable monomer recovery and gas composition data."
"Catalytic performance and debromination of Fe–Ni bimetallic MCM-41 catalyst for the two-stage pyrolysis of waste computer casing plastic A computer casing plastic waste containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs) was pyrolyzed in a two-stage vertical quartz tube reactor using iron and nickel metals modified MCM-41 catalysts. Various catalysts with different ratios of Fe and Ni were prepared and utilized to study their catalytic performance. At the presence of 20%Ni/MCM-41 catalyst, the pyrolytic yield of oil and gas reached maximum values of 49.9 wt% and 13.8 wt% respectively. The co-existence of Fe and Ni showed synergistic effect on oil composition by promoting the formation of valuable single ring hydrocarbons. With regard to the 15%Fe–5%Ni/MCM-41, 10%Fe–10%Ni/MCM-41 and 5%Fe–15%Ni/MCM-41 catalysts, the production of single ring hydrocarbons were 64.58%, 65.93% and 64.74% respectively. The bimetallic catalysts also exhibited remarkable effect on eliminating bromine from pyrolytic oil. At the presence of Fe–Ni/MCM-41, the bromine in pyrolytic oil was reduced to below 4 wt% compared with 10 wt% without catalyst. Higher amounts of Fe in the catalyst is beneficial for the debromination efficiency. The debromination process by the Fe–Ni/MCM-41 may be realized by these different mechanisms: catalytic cracking of organobromines, reaction of loaded metal oxides with HBr/SbBr3, and deposition of organobromines on the surface of catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste computer casing plastic (a commercial plastic waste) using a vertical quartz tube reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Catalytic conversion of linear low density polyethylene into carbon nanomaterials under the combined catalysis of Ni2O3 and poly(vinyl chloride) A one-pot method was used to prepare magnetic Ni/carbon (Ni/C) nanomaterials by catalytic carbonization of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) under the combined catalysis of Ni2O3 and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin. The yield of Ni/C nanomaterials was determined by the pyrolysis temperature, the type and the content of PVC resin. The yield of magnetic Ni/C nanomaterials first increased and then decreased with increasing PVC content. The obtained carbon nanomaterials mainly consisted of long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at lower PVC content but short carbon nanofibers and amorphous carbon at higher PVC content. This is attributed to chlorine radicals from the decomposition of PVC resin promoting the dehydrogenation and aromatization of LLDPE macroradical fragments. The obtained magnetic Ni/C nanomaterials were used as adsorbents for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from water and showed an adsorption capacity as high as 165.5–175.2mg/g, indicating the resultant magnetic Ni/C nanomaterials had potential application in wastewater treatment.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastic LLDPE with PVC resin under controlled conditions, demonstrating measurable product yields, catalyst effects, and product characterization."
"Novel catalyst development from waste tire pyrolysis carbon black for efficient hydrogen-rich syngas generation via polypropylene catalytic pyrolysis Waste plastics pose significant environmental challenges due to their persistent nature and resistance to degradation. Pyrolysis, as a promising chemical treatment technology, has garnered considerable attention for its dual potential in mitigating pollution and recovering high-value energy and chemical products. In this study, a novel Ni/purified carbon black catalyst was synthesized by impregnating active nickel metal onto a purified carbon black support. This catalyst was employed to facilitate the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) in the presence of water vapor, aiming to produce hydrogen-rich syngas while simultaneously achieving the valorization of purified carbon black. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were comprehensively characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, elemental analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) both before and after the reaction. Furthermore, the effects of varying nickel loading ratios on the gas yield and composition during the catalytic reforming of polypropylene were systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that nickel predominantly exists in its elemental form when supported on purified carbon black. Increasing the nickel loading ratio led to a corresponding enhancement in the specific surface area of the catalyst, which in turn significantly improved the production of hydrogen-rich syngas. Under optimal conditions with a nickel loading ratio of 15 % and a catalyst dosage of 1.2 g, the hydrogen yield reached 54.85 mmol/gPP, with a hydrogen concentration of 48.05 %. Additionally, the combined proportion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) in the syngas accounted for 60.23 %, highlighting the catalyst's high efficiency in syngas production.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene waste plastic with measurable hydrogen yield and syngas composition data, using experimental characterization and reactor conditions."
"Production of hydrogen from packaging wastes by two-stage pyrolysis Plastic waste continues to increasingly pollute the environment. Currently, a significant portion of this waste is either landfilled or incinerated to generate energy, which leads to substantial CO2 emissions. However, thermochemical processing is a potential solution to create a circular economy, with pyrolysis combined with the subsequent high-temperature treatment of the vapour-gas mixture being a method preferable to incineration. This study investigated the optimal conditions for the two-stage pyrolysis of non-recyclable plastic waste. The process involved a low-temperature treatment of feedstock, followed by high-temperature exposure of the vapour-gas mixture in the presence of a carbon matrix. The final products of the two-stage pyrolysis were: synthesis gas, mainly consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide; solid pyrolysis residue obtained in the first stage and high-carbon material during the second stage was obtained. The first stage of the two-stage pyrolysis was carried out at various temperatures, ranging from 460 to 540 °C, followed by cracking at 600 to 1000 °C, with different ratios of packaging waste to wood charcoal (1:2, 1:4, 1:6). The conditions for obtaining more than 70 vol% hydrogen in the synthesis gas from packaging waste were determined, the effect of changing the process parameters was studied. The decomposition kinetics of packaging waste showed activation energies of the first and second steps: 165 and 255 kJ/mol (Ozawa–Flynn–Wall method), 164 and 259 kJ/mol (Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose method), respectively. This work contributes to the study of efficient recycling methods for non-recyclable packaging waste and promotes advancements in sustainable waste management practices.","The study involves lab-scale two-stage pyrolysis of non-recyclable plastic packaging waste, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization of synthesis gas composition and decomposition kinetics."
"Liquid-fed waste plastic pyrolysis pilot plant: Effect of reactor volume on product yields A unique waste plastic pyrolysis pilot plant was used for fast pyrolysis (1–5 s vapor residence time) of HDPE at 600 °C. A dissolution pre-treatment step dissolved the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in recycled pyrolysis wax to create a liquid feed to the pyrolysis reactor, avoiding clogging and bridging of the plastic particles that is common in alternative feeding strategies. Three different reactor volumes were tested to determine the effect of residence time on product distribution. Pyrolysis products were cooled through a series of two condenser to separate the products into three groups: a heavy, waxy product (> C15), a lighter liquid product (C6-C15), and a gaseous product (C1-C6). GC/MS analysis was used to characterize the composition of each product. Multiphysics modeling was conducted to estimate the residence time in the reactor and compare the pilot plant results to previously published micropyrolysis research. It was found that residence time had a significant effect on product distribution, with an increase from 1 to 4.5 s of residence time causing a 9 wt% drop in wax (C20-C30) production and a 11 wt% increase in light oil (C5-C10) production. The trends for product distribution as a function of residence time were found to be consistent between both the pilot plant and micropyrolysis systems, demonstrating that the pilot plant system can be “tuned” to produce the desired pyrolysis product.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic with measurable product yields, residence time effects, and GC/MS analysis of product composition."
"Microwave-responsive SiC foam@zeolite core-shell structured catalyst for catalytic pyrolysis of plastics Catalytic pyrolysis is a promising chemical recycling technology to supplement mechanical recycling since plastics can be broken down into monomers or converted to the required fuels and chemicals. In this study, a microwave (MW) -responsive SiC foam@zeoltie core-shell structured catalyst was proposed for the catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins. Under microwave irradiation, the SiC foam core works as both microwave adsorber and catalyst support, thus concentrating the generated heat energy on the ZSM-5 zeolite shell, where the catalytic reaction takes place. SiC foam with an open cellular structure can also improve the global transport of mass and heat during plastics pyrolysis. In this work, the effects of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and alkaline treatment of ZSM-5 zeolite coated SiC foam under MW irradiation on the variations in product distribution from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pyrolysis were investigated at 450 °C. The results indicated that the appropriate acidity and pore structure were crucial to upgrading gas and liquid products. Particularly, the creation of a mesoporous structure in ZSM-5 zeolite via alkaline treatment could improve the diffusion of large molecules and products, thus significantly increasing the selectivity of high-valued light olefins and aromatics while inhibiting the formation of unwanted alkanes, which are expected in the chemical industry. Concretely, the concentration of olefins in gas increased to 51.0 vol% for ZSM-5(50)-0.25AT, and 65.6 vol% for ZSM-5 (50)-0.50AT, compared with 45.2 vol% for the parent ZSM-5(50). The relative concentration of aromatics in liquid decreased from 96.6% for ZSM-5(50) to 75.9% for ZSM-5(50)-0.25AT, and 71.1% for ZSM-5(50)-0.50AT. Given the respective yield of gas and liquid, the total selectivity of C2–C4 olefins and aromatics for mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites could reach 58.6–64.9% during LDPE pyrolysis, which were higher than that for the parent ZSM-5 zeolite.","The study involves microwave-responsive SiC foam@zeolite core-shell catalyst for catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), with measurable product yields, gas and liquid composition analysis, and catalyst performance evaluation under defined reactor conditions."
"Cascade upcycling polystyrene waste into ethylbenzene over Fe2N @ C Thermochemical conversion is one of the most effective ways to upcycle organic solid wastes into fuels and/or value-added chemicals. In this study, the tandem hydropyrolysis/hydrocracking of polystyrene (PS) to produce ethylbenzene was studied using metal nitrides as catalysts. Fe, N co-doped carbon-based catalyst (Fe2N @ C) with core-shell structure was synthesized. The experimental results showed that carbon doping significantly improved the catalytic performance of iron nitride. The yield of ethylbenzene obtained from Fe2N @ C catalysis was 81 wt%, which is much higher than that of Fe2N (63.3 wt%) and commercial iron nitride (FeN, 4.9 wt%) under the hydropyrolysis temperature of 480 ℃, hydrocracking temperature of 280 ℃, and low H2 pressure of 0.2 MPa. The high catalytic activity of Fe2N @ C is ascribed to the synergy of metal-based selective hydrogenation and acid site-mediated C-C bond activation. This work provides a flexible and efficient catalytic technology for the high-value utilization of polystyrene waste.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polystyrene waste with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical conditions."
"Exergy and energy analysis of pyrolysis of plastic wastes in rotary kiln with heat carrier Energy and exergy analysis is a practical thermodynamic method to assess the potentiality of waste-to-energy technologies. In this study, plastic wastes were pyrolyzed in a rotary kiln to recover energy products including gas, oil and char. The effects of heat carrier loading in the kiln and plastic waste types on the pyrolysis process, including carbon distribution, properties of liquid oil/gas, energy and exergy of products, were investigated. Heat carrier loading could enhance the energy and exergy efficiency of the pyrolysis process. The exergy and energy efficiencies of the plastic mixture pyrolysis are in the range of 60.9 %–67.3 % and 59.4–66.0 %, respectively. The energy consumption ratio of polyethylene pyrolysis with 15 % heat carrier loading and plastic mixture pyrolysis with 20 % heat carrier loading showed that the pyrolysis could achieve self-heating by combusting some recycled gas and char products.

"Mixtures of rubber tyre and plastic wastes pyrolysis: A kinetic study The study performed aimed at analysing possible routes for pyrolysis reaction mechanisms of polymeric materials namely RT (rubber tyre) and plastic wastes (PE (polyethylene), PP (polypropylene) and PS (polystyrene)). Consequently, and seeking sustainable transformation of waste streams into valuable chemicals and renewable liquid fuels, mixture of 30% RT, 20% PE, 30% PP and 20% PS was subjected to pyrolysis. Different kinetic models were studied using experimental data. None of the mechanisms found in literature led to a numerical adjustment and different pathways were investigated. Kinetic studies were performed aiming to evaluate direct conversions into new solid, liquid and gaseous products and if parallel reactions and/or reversible elementary steps should be included. Experiments were performed in batch system at different temperatures and reaction times. Kinetic models were evaluated and reaction pathways were proposed. Models reasonably fit experimental data, allow explaining wastes thermal degradation. Kinetic parameters were estimated for all temperatures and dependence of Ea and pre-exponential factor on temperature was evaluated. The rate constant of some reactions exhibited nonlinear temperature dependence on the logarithmic form of Arrhenius law. This fact strongly suggests that temperature has a significant effect on reaction mechanism of pyrolysis of mixtures of rubber tyre and plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS) and rubber tyres, with measured product yields, kinetic analysis, and experimental data from batch reactor tests at varying temperatures and reaction times."
"Pyrolysis of residual tyres: Exergy and kinetics of pyrogas Around 1.5 billion tyres are produced each year, with a huge percentage ending up in landfills. Residual rubber tyres have a calorific value of 39–42 MJkg−1, making them an appealing candidate for pyrolysis. The goal of this project is converting discarded tyres into pyro-energy. A single column fixed bed batch pyrolyzer was built to pyrolyzer residual tyres.The residual tyres that were left over were ground into a fine powder. An elemental analyser was used to quantify the amount of total hydrogen, sulphur, carbon and nitrogen in powdered residual tyres. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis at different rates of heating, including Thermo Gravimetric Analysis at different rates of heat, including 5 °C min−1, 10 °C min-1 and 15 °C min-1, was used to assess the thermal deterioration profile of the residual tyres.The residual tyres were thermally cracked at temperatures between 450 and 550 °C, with each increment of 50 °C. Each trail's pyro-gas was monitored separately, and the exergy was calculated using thermodynamic rules. To estimate kinetic factors such as activation energy and reaction sequence, four distinct model-free approaches were used. Friedman's activation energy on average has been determined as 127.35 kJ mol−1. At 550 °C, a high of 52.11% of Pyro-gas was detected. The maximum energy and exergy were 5.49 MJkg−1 and 4.92 MJkg−1 respectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of residual tyres (a waste plastic material) using a fixed-bed batch reactor, with measured product yields, temperature-dependent gas production, and kinetic analysis via TGA and model-free methods."
"Enhancing the combustion characteristics of plastic pyrolytic oils by doping nanocarbon additives for alternative energy This study focuses on enhancing the combustion properties of plastic pyrolytic oil blends (LDPE and PP) by incorporating nanocarbons (fullerene and graphene). Single-droplet measurements were conducted with nanocarbon concentrations of 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L, blended with or without LDPE and PP. The experimental setup included a K-type thermocouple for temperature measurement and a CCD camera to observe droplet evolution in an atmospheric chamber. The results indicate that neat LDPE exhibited a faster evaporation rate and a shorter droplet lifetime compared to neat PP. The addition of nanocarbons to pyrolytic oils enhanced evaporation performance by a factor of two. Droplet fluctuations in nanocarbon-blended fuel significantly shortened the transient heating phase of pure pyrolytic oils. Furthermore, nanocarbon loading reduced the ignition delay by more than 30 %. A higher nanocarbon concentration (5 mg/L) in LDPE reduced the ignition delay by up to 10 %, whereas a lower concentration (1 mg/L) in PP was sufficient to achieve a similar reduction. Among the tested samples, LDPE-g1 exhibited the highest combustion rate, followed by PP-f1. The study found that graphene was the most effective additive for LDPE, while fullerene performed best with PP. Lastly, LDPE-g1 demonstrated evaporation performance comparable to petrol-diesel.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and PP) to produce pyrolytic oil, followed by experimental characterization of fuel properties with measurable results on combustion performance and evaporation rates."
"A lab scale waste to energy conversion study for pyrolysis of plastic with and without catalyst: Engine emissions testing study Plastics in many forms have been regarded as one of the most polluting material in the modern world. Therefore, a study has been conducted to check the effectiveness of catalyst-fly ash and zeolite on the production of biofuel from plastics as an attempt to contribute in the reduction of plastic waste pollution to the environment. A lab scale plastic pyrolysis plant has been constructed and feed particle size of 3 ± 1.5 cm2 were used as raw materials. The samples were tested in the pyrolysis plant at about 500 ± 30 °C with and without the presence of catalyst. The catalyst loading ratio of 1:10 catalyst to feed is applied. The result shows that plastic pyrolysis (bottle) without any catalysts have the highest liquid fraction yield with an average yield of 24% while those with catalyst has lower yield (16–22%). Carry bags with zeolite catalyst yield liquid fraction of 22% at a conversion rate of 47%. The inclusion of catalyst has lowered the yield but has produce oil yield of superior quality compared with the samples without catalyst. Engine characteristics study showed that blend fuel D80PO20 (80:20 diesel: plastic pyrolytic oil) have shown similar cylinder pressure during combustion with diesel. Higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific energy consumption were also observed from the engine testing using the blend fuel. The blend fuel has lower hydrocarbon emissions while oxides of nitrogen reduces by 19% and 26% compared to pure diesel and PPO respectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic bottles and carry bags with and without catalysts, reporting measurable yields, product quality, and engine performance data."
"Self-activated pyrolytic synthesis of S, N and O co-doped porous carbon derived from discarded COVID-19 masks for lithium sulfur batteries The continuous spread of COVID-19 has produced a large number of abandoned disposable medical masks (DMMs), which have a greater negative impact on the environment and biosafety. In response to this issue, a method for rapid microwave sulfonation, nitrification and oxidation of DMMs was proposed to convert DMMs with low carbonization efficiency into aromatic carbon with good thermal stability, which not only maintained 51 wt% of initial mass at 1000 °C, but also achieved in situ co-doping of S, N and O. Subsequently, porous carbons derived from DMMs were synthesized by self-activation pyrolysis, which avoided consumption of alkali and metal salts in the traditional activation process. It was further found that low pyrolysis temperature was not enough to produce enough active material H2 and H2O to obtain high specific surface area, while increasing pyrolysis temperature could adjust the specific surface area of as-prepared carbon, ranging from 52 m2·g−1 to as high as 890 m2 g−1. Thanks to synergistic effect of S, N, and O co-doping and hierarchical porous structure, the first discharge specific capacity of sample synthesized by self-activated pyrolysis at 900 °C was 1459.8 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C, and the discharge specific capacity retention at 0.5 C after 400 cycles was 52.3%.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of discarded COVID-19 masks (a waste plastic material) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent specific surface area (52–890 m²·g⁻¹), and performance metrics for battery applications."
"Conversion of low-density polyethylene into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by catalytic pyrolysis: Comparison of HZSM-5, Hβ, HY and MCM-41 The catalytic properties of different catalytic materials on the pyrolysis of plastics have been extensively investigated. In order to better understand the relevant mechanism of catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste, the effect of different acidity and pore size of catalytic material on its pyrolysis kinetic parameters and the distribution of pyrolysis products needs to be studied to provide a stronger theoretical basis for its resource utilization. This study aims to study the effects of HZSM-5, Hβ, HY and MCM-41 on the thermodynamic properties, kinetic parameters and pyrolysis characteristics of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), analyze the relationship between the specific catalytic pyrolysis products and the properties of the catalyst. Among the four catalysts, HZSM-5 obtained the most concentrated product distribution and the highest yield of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and it was found that the cracking of LDPE mainly occurred in its pores. Due to the large pore size and low concentration of acid sites, the main product type obtained by MCM-41 was olefins. In addition, it was found that HY reduced the pyrolysis temperature of LDPE and the activation energy of the reaction to the greatest extent. The different catalytic effects were mainly caused by different pore structures and acid site concentration. Moreover, it was found that the addition of catalyst changed the cracking mechanism of LDPE. Under the comprehensive consideration with the goal of producing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, HZSM-5 is the most suitable catalyst among them.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Production of liquid fuels and chemicals from pyrolysis of Bangladeshi bicycle/rickshaw tire wastes Tire wastes in the form of used bicycle/rickshaw tires available in Bangladesh were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed fire-tube heating reactor under different pyrolysis conditions to determine the role of final temperature, sweeping gas flow rate and feed size on the product yields and liquid product composition. Final temperature range studied was between 375 and 575°C and the highest liquid product yield was obtained at 475°C. Liquid products obtained under the most suitable conditions were characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, 1H NMR and GC–MS techniques. The results show that it is possible to obtain liquid products that are comparable to petroleum fuels and valuable chemical feedstock from bicycle/rickshaw tire wastes if the pyrolysis conditions are chosen accordingly.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic tires, reports measurable product yields and composition analysis, and includes experimental characterization techniques such as GC–MS, FT-IR, and elemental analysis."
"Dehydrochlorination of polyvinyl chloride and co-pyrolysis with maize cob: Insight into product composition and thermal behaviour Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waste can be a good candidate as feedstock for co-pyrolysis with biomass. However, the high chlorine content in PVC pyrolysis products constitutes a barrier to their use. One way to eliminate chlorine from PVC is dehydrochlorination. This study explores the co-pyrolysis of maize cob with dehydrochlorinated PVC, focusing on product yields, chlorine distribution, and thermal interactions. Virgin PVC was dehydrochlorinated at 593 K, achieving 99 % chlorine removal, and its thermal behaviour was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). For the three heating rates studied: 5, 10 and 30 K/min, HCl was the main compound released up to 593 K. Lab-scale co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 873 K with varying biomass-to-PVC mass ratios. Increasing the PVC content enhanced oil yield and aromatic compound formation, slightly increased char carbon content, and redistributed chlorine predominantly into the oil phase. The gas phase was enriched with hydrocarbons such as methane, ethene, and ethane. The results indicate that dehydrochlorinated PVC alters biomass pyrolysis pathways, promoting deoxygenation reactions and reducing char formation. These findings provide insights into optimizing co-pyrolysis conditions for improved product quality, demonstrating the potential of dehydrochlorinated PVC as a carbon-rich additive for thermochemical biomass conversion.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of dehydrochlorinated PVC and its co-pyrolysis with biomass, reporting measurable product yields, chlorine distribution, and thermal behavior with analytical characterization."

Kinetic study Thermal decomposition of natural polystyrene, recycled plastics, low density polyethylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyenterophthalate of ethylene, and polypropylene has been carried out. Both isothermal and dynamic experiments at different heating rates have been performed in a thermobalance with the objective of determining the kinetic parameters. Also, a first set of experiments, performed in a cylindrical stainless-steel atmospheric pressure reactor, was designed to evaluate the products of the pyrolysis process. The effects of N2 flow rate (200–300 cm3 min−1), initial mass fed to the reactor (15–75 mg), temperature (415–490 °C), and heating rate (5–30 K min−1) were studied. By application of a first order kinetic model, the activation energy for every plastic has been determined. The values of activation energy in isothermic and dynamic regimen are the following: natural polystyrene: 136, and 168 to 286 kJ/mol. Recycled plastic: 250, and 150 to 290 kJ/mol.

"Comparison of real waste (MSW and MPW) pyrolysis in batch reactor over different catalysts. Part II: Contaminants, char and pyrolysis oil properties Pyrolysis of real wastes (MPW and MSW) has been investigated at 500°C, 550°C and 600°C using Y-zeolite, β-zeolite, equilibrium FCC, MoO3, Ni-Mo-catalyst, HZSM-5 and Al(OH)3 as catalysts. The viscosity of pyrolysis oils could be decreased by the using of catalysts, especially by β-zeolite and MoO3. Both carbon frame and double bound isomerization was found in case of thermo-catalytic pyrolysis. Char morphology and texture analysis showed more coke deposits on the catalyst surface using MSW raw material. Pyrolysis oils had K, S, P Cl, Ca, Zn, Fe, Cr, Br and Sb as contaminants; and the concentrations of K, S, P, Cl and Br could be decreased by the using of catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real waste plastics (MPW and MSW) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of pyrolysis oil and char."
"Liquid oils produced from pyrolysis of plastic wastes with heat carrier in rotary kiln The conversion of plastic waste to energy product is a promising solution to both energy shortage and environment pollution. In this study, plastic wastes were pyrolyzed in a rotary kiln to recover liquid oils that could be used as the source of valuable chemicals or fuels. The effects of filling ratio of heat carriers, and plastic wastes types on the product spectrum were investigated. The dynamic models of heat carrier in pyrolysis of plastic wastes showed that the suitable filling ratio of heat carrier for oil production is 15%. The liquid oils generated from a simulated mixture of plastic wastes pyrolysis had the most gasoline range hydrocarbons and reached to 89.1%. The simulated distillation of liquid oils showed that the gasoline fraction was between 49% and 84.5%. The NMR analysis of liquid oils obtained from polyethylene and a simulated mixture of plastic wastes pyrolysis showed that loading more heat carrier in the rotary kiln was favorable to produce olefins and paraffin. The NMR analysis and the heat carrier models revealed that the greater heat transfer enhanced the H+ transfer in radical reactions.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic waste in a rotary kiln with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of oil composition."
"Waste plastic thermal-transformed CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO for free radical activation and bacteria sterilization Pyrolysis technology has been focused on waste plastics for recycling. However, there is rare research for reusing pyrolysis products (carbon nanotubes). Based on pyrolysis technology of waste polypropylene (PP) plastic, carbon nanotube coated Fe–Mo/MgO nanomaterial (CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO) was prepared by chemical vapor deposition to remove Gram-pathogenic bacteria. The addition of Mo and MgO promoted the cracking of PP plastic and the formation of MWCNTs. The as-obtained CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO can stimulate H2O/O2 to produce abundant ·OH, ·O2 − and 1O2 radicals, which probably resulting from the synergistic effect of delocalization of CNTs and REDOX pair of Fe3O4. Consequently, the removal rate of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO composite catalyst can reach 100% within 2h, without the help of any additional energy or active oxidant. At the same time, the material is remarkable stability and reusability with complete removal of pathogens after six cycles. This study not only provides a method for the synthesis of highly effective sterilizers, but also opens up a new direction for the application of functional carbon nanocomposites prepared by pyrolysis of waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (PP) plastic to produce CNT@Fe–Mo/MgO, with measurable product formation, catalyst performance, and experimental characterization of bacterial sterilization efficacy."
"Catalytic process toward green recycling of polyvinyl chloride: A study on thermodynamic, kinetic and pyrolysis characteristics Municipal solid wastes (MSW) include a considerable amount of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). How to quickly and harmlessly dispose of the PVC-containing MSW and convert them into a valuable resource is an urgent issue at present. The application of catalysts has yet been proven to be effective in mitigating organic pollutant production. In the present study, a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) were utilized to investigate the thermodynamic properties, kinetic parameters and pyrolysis characteristics of PVC with different zeolites including HZSM-5 with the Si/Al of 80 and 280, ferrierite, HY and MCM-41 zeolite. It turned out that the introduction of different catalysts with different pore structures and acid site concentrations made different catalytic effects on the cracking mechanism of PVC. Among the five zeolites, MCM-41 decreased temperature at the 50 % conversion to 296 °C, increased weight loss mate at a maximum of 25 %/min and generated fewer PAHs (whose changing amplitude decreased by 94 % in ex-situ catalytic mode in comparison to non-catalytic mode), indicative of its higher catalytic activity in PVC polymer degradation. Under the consideration of maximizing catalytic cracking activity and minimizing secondary pollutants production, non-catalytic dechlorination at approximately 300 °C followed by catalytic degradation in ex-situ mode over mesoporous MCM-41 at higher temperatures was the best recommendation.","The study investigates pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a waste plastic, using lab-scale TGA and Py-GC/MS with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance data."
"Uncovering strategies for quantifying thermo-kinetics, reaction heat, and synergistic rates of heat transfer-degradation in the chemical upcycling of polyolefins Utilizing fluidized bed reactors for the upcycling of polyolefins (polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP)) is a promising recycling approach, while the industrialization of this emerging process is still challenging in reactor design. Herein, thermo-kinetics, reaction heat, and heat transfer-degradation synergistic rates of polyolefin pyrolysis were systematically investigated via Py-GCMS and TGA-DSC. We found that the complete pyrolysis time (3.1–14.6 s) at 550 °C is comparable to the residence time of the waste plastic catalytic cracking process (∼5 s), PP is more easily thermally decomposed than PE under the same conditions. Moreover, we present a reliable method for calculating reaction heat based on thermodynamic principles and detailed hydrocarbon composition, revealing a negative linear relationship between cracking depth and reaction heat over different heat supply rates (temperature at 500–600 °C), with reaction heat ranging from 283.3 to 494.3 kJ kg−1 for PE and 592.2–729.1 kJ kg−1 for PP, respectively. Quantitative results from the coupled heat transfer-degradation model indicate elevated heat transfer limitations at higher temperatures (>550 °C, faster heat supply and reaction rate) or larger particle sizes (>250 μm, slower heat transfer rate and higher Biot number), highlighting optimal pyrolysis efficiency for PP particles of 250 μm. We anticipate this work could guide the design and optimization of reactors for upcycling polyolefin waste.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyolefins (PE and PP) using fluidized bed reactors with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization via Py-GCMS and TGA-DSC."
"Hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis oil in a microreactor Use of a packed bed microreactor for the first stage hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of pyrolysis oil was investigated. The effects of various processing conditions such as temperature, hydrogen partial pressure, and residence time on Extent of HDO, hydrogen consumption, and space-time-consumption were investigated using reduced sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. External and internal mass transfer resistances were examined in the microreactor. High hydrogen consumption along with small oxygen removal suggests that in hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis oil hydrogenation cannot be avoided. Reactor plugging at 543K due to coke formation/polymerization shows that first stage HDO at a temperature below 543K was required to convert highly reactive compounds so that second stage HDO at higher temperature can be conducted to remove oxygen completely. Hydrogen consumption and percent oxygen removed for this first stage HDO are comparable to literature values; however, it is found that in a microreactor these values are attainable at much lower pressure and residence time.","The study involves hydrodeoxygenation of pyrolysis oil, which is derived from plastic pyrolysis, and includes lab-scale microreactor experiments with measurable conditions and product analysis."
"Effectiveness of CO2-mediated pyrolysis for the treatment of biodegradable plastics: A case study of polybutylene adipate terephthalate/polylactic acid mulch film Despite the widespread use of biodegradable mulch films, they are often unsuitable for disposal in open environments and cannot be recycled in the same manner as conventional plastics; hence, an effective disposal method needs to be suggested. Herein, pyrolysis of biodegradable mulch film made of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid (PLA) was considered. The pyrolysis of the PBAT/PLA mulch film in CO2 yielded more non-condensable gases than the pyrolysis in N2 due to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles at 800 °C. At higher than 600 °C in CO2, reverse water-gas shift reaction considerably increased CO selectivity. Using CO2 in the pyrolysis suppressed the generation of wax and char, attributed to CO2 enhancing not only thermal cleavage of pyrolytic volatiles released from the PBAT/PLA mulch film but also O–H and C–H bonds existing on the substance. The CO2 pyrolysis agent forwarded the cleavage of the polymeric bond of PBAT to produce more monomeric compounds (e.g., adipates and phthalates), while it suppressed radical reactions to produce less polycyclic compounds and phenyls. Rising temperature raised the gaseous pyrolyzate yield and lowered the char and wax yields. The use of CO2 agents in pyrolysis has a significant feature of upcycling biodegradable plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste biodegradable plastics (PBAT/PLA mulch film) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalytic effects of CO2, including detailed product composition analysis."
"Effect of zeolite catalysts on pyrolysis liquid oil The aim of this study was to determine the quality and applications of liquid oil produced by thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) plastic waste by using a small pilot scale pyrolysis reactor. Thermal pyrolysis produced maximum liquid oil (80.8%) with gases (13%) and char (6.2%), while catalytic pyrolysis using synthetic and natural zeolite decreased the liquid oil yield (52%) with an increase in gases (17.7%) and char (30.1%) production. The lower yield but improved quality of liquid oil through catalytic pyrolysis are due to catalytic features of zeolites such as microporous structure and high BET surface area. The liquid oils, both from thermal and catalytic pyrolysis consist of around 99% aromatic hydrocarbons, as further confirmed by GC-MS results. FT-IR analysis further showed chemical bonding and functional groups of mostly aromatic hydrocarbons, which is consistent with GC-MS results. The produced liquid oils can be suitable for energy generation and heating purposes after the removal of acid, solid residues and contaminants. Further upgrading of liquid oil and blending with diesel is required for its potential use as a transport fuel.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene plastic waste in a lab-scale reactor with measurable product yields, GC-MS and FT-IR analysis of liquid oil composition, and catalyst performance evaluation."
"Thermal decomposition of spent lithium-ion batteries pouch: Investigating kinetic and thermodynamic compensation effects A deeper understanding of the pyrolysis process for main and additional components in spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) could provide valuable insights for optimizing their recycling processes. This study examined the thermal behavior, kinetics, thermodynamics, and product evolution during the pyrolysis of laminate pouch primarily composed of polypropylene and polyamide. The kinetic compensation effect (KCE) and thermodynamic compensation effect (TCE) were also probed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the conversion. The degradation process was divided into three stages, with total mass loss ranging from 31.14 to 40.28 % and peak temperatures between 419 and 472 °C. The average activation energy was determined to be 118.06 kJ mol−1, with specific values of 99.25, 119.06 and 139.31 kJ mol−1 within conversion rate of 0.10–0.30, 0.35–0.75 and 0.80–0.95, respectively. The pouch conversion followed D1 diffusion mechanism. The KCE was confirmed and reconstructed f α = α 0.45316 ( 2 α 1.55 ) - 1 displayed an excellent fit. Thermodynamic analysis implied that this conversion process was endothermic and non-spontaneous. Enthalpy and entropy relationship demonstrated the existence of TEC with compensation temperature (Tcomp) and experimental temperature (Texp) of 676.20 K and 693.23 K, respectively. In addition, free energy of compensation (ΔGcomp) was found to be 164.51 kJ mol−1, in agreement with experimental binding free energy (ΔGexp) range of 166.48–170.65 kJ mol−1, further confirmed the validity of the adopted mechanism.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene and polyamide from spent lithium-ion battery pouches, with measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and analytical characterization."
"Effect of different catalyst on the co-cracking of Jatropha oil, vacuum residue and high density polyethylene Co-processing of Jatropha oil (JO), vacuum residue (VR) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were investigated to determine the behavior of the individual and blended mixture under atmospheric pressure and thermal heating conditions. A fixed bed tubular batch reactor was used for the experimental study under nitrogen atmosphere. The activity of the four catalysts CAT-A (Ni–Mo/SiAl), CAT-R (ZSM-5+SiAl), CAT-Z (ZSM-5) and FCC catalyst CAT-N on the co-cracking of binary and ternary mixture has been studied. CAT-R was the best catalyst used for JO+HDPE co-cracking as it leads to the formation of 45%, gasoline range hydrocarbons (C7–C11) and 49% diesel range hydrocarbons in the cracked liquid. CAT-Z was the best catalyst for VR+HDPE co-cracking as it lead to the formation of 33% olefins which were absent in the thermally cracked liquid. In case of JO+VR co-cracking CAT-Z was found to show increase in the liquid yield and it also lead to the formation of 37% gasoline range hydrocarbons and 35% diesel range hydrocarbons. It was also observed that the use of catalyst had a positive effect on the pH content of the catalytically cracked liquid products.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) with other feedstocks using a fixed-bed tubular batch reactor, with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data reported."
"Jet fuel production from waste plastics via catalytic pyrolysis with activated carbons With the increasing amount of waste plastics being used domestically and industrially, the disposition of those being not reusable is a challenging task. Herein, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics over seven types of commercial and home-made activated carbons was studied in a facile tube reactor. A central composite experimental design was further adapted to optimize the reaction conditions and up to 100 area% of the obtained liquid components belonged to jet fuel-ranged hydrocarbons, in which alkanes and aromatics accounted for 71.8% and 28.2%, respectively. Experiment results revealed that these activated carbons although generated via various physical and chemical activation processes could all exhibited excellent catalytic performance in converting low-density polyethylene into jet fuel and H2-enriched gases. Properties of activated carbons were also characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, nitrogen gas adsorption, and chemical adsorption. It can be concluded that the acidity was a critical factor in determining the catalyst activity, where jet fuel-ranged alkanes and aromatics were favored by using activated carbons of weak and relevant strong acidity, respectively. Rising catalytic reaction temperature could enhance the aromatization of alkanes to increase the percentage of aromatics and release more hydrogen molecules. In addition, the production of jet fuel was also achieved from daily waste plastics, which was also confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The present work offers a novel route of converting waste plastics directly into transportation jet fuel.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (low-density polyethylene and daily waste plastics) in a lab-scale tube reactor, with measurable yields of jet fuel-range hydrocarbons, catalyst characterization, and temperature–yield relationships."
"Study on H3PO4-activated carbon catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and LDPE to poly-generation syngas and aromatics at low temperature Biomass-derived carbon activated by H3PO4 was adopted to catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to produce syngas and aromatics on a fixed bed reactor. Effects of LDPE ratio in the feedstock, catalytic co-pyrolysis temperature and ratio of catalyst to feedstock on the yields and compositions of the products were investigated. The increase of LDPE ratio in liquid first improved and then reduced the relative content of aromatics, while it showed a positive effect on the yield and the H2/CO ratio of gas. 500℃ was an optimum temperature, under which the relative content of aromatics in liquid kept higher, meanwhile, avoided the undesirable polymerization reactions of monocyclic aromatics. At the same time, the content of H2 in gas reached a maximum (59.3%), which was in favor of poly-generation. H3PO4-activated carbon catalyst (H3PO4-ACC) with abundant functional groups on surface catalyzed cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, cyclization and aromatization reactions so as to facilitate the generation of aromatics. Non-condensable gas was dry reformed on P-ACC at the expense of CO2, CH4 and CO to generate char and H2. When the reaction condition was at a LDPE ratio of 50%, a catalyst/feedstock ratio of 2:1 and at 500℃, the relative content of aromatics in liqiud was 81.65% and the proportion of syngas component in gas was 79.73%. The volume ratio of H2/CO approached to 3:1 in gas under this condition. H3PO4-ACC catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo and LDPE could obtain high quality gas and liquid products at a relative low reaction temperature, which provided a new research idea on high-value application of biomass and waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) and biomass in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"High quality oil and H2-rich gas production from municipal solid wastes through pyrolysis and catalytic reforming: Comparison of differently modified waste char-based catalysts Pyrolysis, a promising method for extracting energy and value-added chemicals from municipal solid waste (MSW), encounters challenges associated with generation of inferior quality oil and low-quality char byproducts. In this context, this study proposed catalytic reforming of pyrolysis volatiles derived from MSW, using MSW char (MSWC) and modified MSWC-based catalysts to produce high-quality oil containing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAH), alkanes and alkenes, and H2-rich gas products. Three groups of modified MSWC-based catalysts are prepared through the activation of MSWC with Na2CO3, Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O and ZnCl2 for the reforming process. Experimental findings reveal that impregnating MSW with ZnCl2, specifically the ZnCl2/C-1:1 char from one-step pyrolysis, exhibits the most favorable catalytic performance, with a 47% selectivity of MAH in oil product, yielding > 25 wt% oil at 450 °C and a calorific value of 26.24 MJ/kg. Simultaneously, 44 wt% of MSW is converted into gas products with a 49 v/v% H2 concentration for ZnCl2/C-1:2 catalyst. The Na2CO3-activated MSWC catalyst corresponds to the highest oil yields and achieves an alkane selectivity of 45.95 area% in the oil product, while Zn(NO3)2-activated MSWC catalyst corresponds to the highest oxygen compounds in the oil product, thus with the lowest calorific value of 19.4 MJ/kg. These results highlight that varying catalyst modifications to MSW char can effectively improve the production of distinct oil compounds, with Zn[OH]+ species and higher Lewis-acid content in the catalyst exerting a positive influence on aromatic hydrocarbon production; and Na2CO3 facilitating alkane production. This study thus provides valuable insights for upgrading oil product quality and increasing H2 concentration in gas products, particularly at lower pyrolysis and reforming temperatures.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (a source of plastic waste) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis, including oil selectivity, gas H2 concentration, and calorific value."
"An innovative process for mass production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes by means of low-cost pyrolysis of polyolefins An innovative process for a mass production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by means of pyrolysis of virgin or recycled polyolefins is described. The technique uses solid–gas fluidised bed reactors, continuously operated under conditions which allow high heating rates of the polymers, high heat and material exchange coefficients and a reliable control of residence times in the reactor. The obtained MWCNTs have been characterized by TGA, SEM and TEM microscopy as well as X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the proposed process allows the production of MWCNTs compatible with most of the already known applications, in large quantities and at low cost. This makes extremely wider the field of possible applications of these nanostructured materials.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyolefins (plastics) in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product characterization (MWCNTs) and analytical techniques (TGA, SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman)."
"High efficiency chlorine removal from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pyrolysis with a gas–liquid fluidized bed reactor In this research a gas–liquid fluidized bed reactor was developed for removing chlorine (Cl) from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to favor its pyrolysis treatment. In order to efficiently remove Cl within a limited time before extensive generation of hydrocarbon products, the gas–liquid fluidized bed reactor was running at 280–320°C, where hot N2 was used as fluidizing gas to fluidize the molten polymer, letting the molten polymer contact well with N2 to release Cl in form of HCl. Experimental results showed that dechlorination efficiency is mainly temperature dependent and 300°C is a proper reaction temperature for efficient dechlorination within a limited time duration and for prevention of extensive pyrolysis; under this temperature 99.5% of Cl removal efficiency can be obtained within reaction time around 1min after melting is completed as the flow rate of N2 gas was set around 0.47–0.85Nm3 kg−1 for the molten PVC. Larger N2 flow rate and additives in PVC would enhance HCl release but did not change the final dechlorination efficiency; and excessive N2 flow rate should be avoided for prevention of polymer entrainment. HCl is emitted from PVC granules or scraps at the mean time they started to melt and the melting stage should be taken into consideration when design the gas–liquid fluidized bed reactor for dechlorination.","The study involves pyrolysis of PVC waste in a gas–liquid fluidized bed reactor with measurable dechlorination efficiency, temperature-dependent results, and defined reactor conditions and product (HCl) yields."
"Enhanced syngas production via plastic rubber chemical looping gasification: Role of iron–nickel oxide oxygen carriers To meet the growing demand for efficient waste management solutions, a novel method called Plastic Rubber Chemical Loop Gasification (PRCLG) offers an innovative and effective approach to the thermal treatment of rubber and plastic waste, producing high-purity fuel and hydrogen-rich syngas. In this study, iron-nickel oxide was synthesized and used as an oxygen carrier to facilitate the PRCLG process. The impact of these oxygen carriers on syngas production was thoroughly investigated, and the evolution of the oxygen carrier's activity was analyzed through changes in the microenvironment during the gasification process. Experimental results showed that under pyrolysis conditions at 750 °C, the syngas yield was 1142 mL/g. After introducing a controlled atmosphere with 1.5 mL/h of water vapor, the syngas yield increased to 2150 mL/g. Further enhancement of the syngas yield using a catalyst resulted in a yield of 3562 mL/g, with a carbon conversion rate of 94%. The study confirmed that optimal syngas yields were achieved at 750 °C, highlighting the importance of precise temperature control. Over ten cycles spanning 600 min, the iron-nickel oxide oxygen carrier exhibited stable performance, demonstrating its durability and effectiveness. This innovative PRCLG method not only provides a solution for the disposal of rubber and plastic waste but also contributes to the production of valuable energy resources, aligning with sustainable development goals and advancing waste-to-energy technologies.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic and rubber waste with measurable syngas yields, temperature-dependent performance, and catalyst effects, confirming experimental data and plastic pyrolysis."
"The role of the Pt-group dehydrogenation catalyst in alkane metathesis for polyolefin deconstruction Recent proposed approaches in the depolymerization of waste plastics employ an olefin intermediate to produce alkanes or alkenes using olefin metathesis in tandem chemistry. Here we investigated the role of the dehydrogenation catalyst on reaction rate, kinetics, and product distribution in heterogeneous tandem dehydrogenation and olefin metathesis (alkane metathesis) of three different alkane reactants, including polyethylene. We found that many properties to which alkane dehydrogenation rates were sensitive—including metal composition, nanoparticle size, and surface doping of Re species also controlled activity in Tandem D/OM. When comparing Pd, Pt, and Pt3Sn1, supported Pd in tandem with a Re2O7 olefin metathesis catalyst showed four-fold higher activity (surface area basis) compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 catalysts on the same support, mainly due to differences in the rate of hydrogenation. Catalyst preparation resulted in metal nanoparticles partially covered by ReOx, as seen from elemental mapping. Co-location of Re2O7 and Pd correlated with increased rates of hydrogenation (i.e., an increase in the rate of alkane formation and simultaneous lowering of the rate of alkene formation), with a reaction order in catalyst study that further supported this conclusion. The Pd and Re2O7 system displayed marked improvement compared to Pt or Pt3Sn1 with Re2O7, and previous work, in the depolymerization rate of a linear polyethylene feedstock, with over 94 % reduction in polymer molecular weight in 15 h at 190 °C using less catalyst and increased reactant loadings, while keeping solvent to polymer consumption below 2.5.","The study involves the depolymerization of polyethylene via catalytic alkane metathesis, which is a form of plastic pyrolysis, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and reaction kinetics reported."
"Pyrolysis of bulk molding compound: Mechanisms, products characterization, and recovery potential Thermosetting composite materials pose challenges for recycling due to their complex composition and crosslinked structure. Moreover, energy recovery is hindered by the low calorific value of highly filled and flame-retarded composites. This study focuses on Bulk Molding Compound (BMC), a thermosetting composite based on Unsaturated Polyester Resin, reinforced with glass fibers, and using Aluminum Hydroxide as a flame retardant. Thermal degradation mechanisms of BMC were investigated using Thermogravimetric Analysis coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. A lab-scale pyrolysis test was also conducted to explore the recovery and potential applications of pyrolysis products. The pyrolysis process yielded oil (31 % by weight), gas (10 %), and solid residue (59 %). The oil phase contained a notable concentration of styrene (more than 40 %). Analysis of the pyrolysis gas revealed a composition primarily consisting of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and lower hydrocarbons, with a Gross Calorific Value of 7.5 MJ/m3. Additionally, the solid residue obtained from pyrolysis presented opportunities for closed-loop recycling as filler in BMC, and as aggregate in the construction sector. The findings underscore pyrolysis as a promising approach for BMC waste management, offering opportunities for resource recovery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste Bulk Molding Compound, a thermosetting composite containing plastic components, with measurable product yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Production of liquid fuels from co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and spent coffee grounds: Comparison of microwave energy and liquified petroleum gas as heat source on the fuel properties High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is one of the most widely used plastic materials. However, its non-degradable nature makes it a persistent pollutant that requires proper management. Pyrolysis has been recognized as a promising technology for converting HDPE waste into value-added products. The efficiency of HDPE pyrolysis can be enhanced through the addition of spent coffee grounds (SCG), a process known as co-pyrolysis. This study aims to evaluate the co-pyrolysis of HDPE and SCG by investigating the impact of heat sources on liquid fuel production. In this research, co-pyrolysis was conducted using microwave and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) heating, with variations in SCG:HDPE ratios, reaction temperatures, and microwave power. The results indicate that these parameters significantly influence the liquid fuel yield. The highest yield was obtained with an SCG:HDPE ratio of 1:3, for both microwave and LPG heating modes. GC–MS analysis revealed the composition of the liquid fuels, showing that hydrocarbons were the dominant components in both heating methods. The produced liquid fuels comprised organic compounds ranging from C9 to C18. Furthermore, fuel properties were assessed, demonstrating that the microwave-assisted process yielded a higher calorific value (42.11 MJ/kg), thereby validating its effectiveness over LPG heating. This study highlights the advantages of microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis in producing liquid fuels from SCG and HDPE. Further investigations are required to optimize reaction parameters, assess environmental impacts, and evaluate the economic feasibility of scaling up this technology for waste-based biofuel production.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) and spent coffee grounds using microwave and LPG heating, with measurable yields, GC–MS analysis of hydrocarbon composition, and fuel properties including calorific value."
"Co-pyrolysis characteristics of forestry and agricultural residues and waste plastics: Thermal decomposition and products distribution Co-pyrolysis technology is an important realizable pathway for efficient resource utilization of different kinds of organic solid wastes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and pyrolyze coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) were used to examine the thermal decomposition behavior, pyrolysis performance, and products distribution from different kinds of solid wastes. Results are presented using agricultural and forestry residues (poplar biomass and rape straw), waste plastics (polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene) and their mixtures in 1:1 mass ratio. The TGA results showed a low comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) for the examined agricultural and forestry residues as compared to their mixtures with waste plastics that showed improved pyrolysis performance during their co-pyrolysis. The FTIR data of forestry and agricultural residues and waste plastics showed that they have a similar functional group (-CH3, -CH2, -CH and -C-). The possible occurrence of the products in the pyrolysis was further predicted by these functional groups. The results of Py-GC/MS analysis showed that the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons in co-pyrolysis of agricultural and forestry residues and waste plastics improved compared to solo pyrolysis of agricultural and forestry residues. The study provides efficient synergistic conversion of biomass and plastics for their treatment with favorable products distribution and yields.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVC, PS) with agricultural and forestry residues, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis via Py-GC/MS, and thermal characterization using TGA and FTIR."
"Catalytic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate in hot compressed water Zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2) catalyzed depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in hot compressed water (HCW) was carried out in a batch autoclave reactor, as a potential method for chemical recycling of waste PET. The effects of the ratio of Zn(Ac)2 to PET (0–3%), temperature (220–300°C), and reaction time (5–60min) were investigated. The optimal conditions for complete catalytic depolymerization of PET were temperature 240°C, pressure 3.2MPa, reaction time 30min, and Zn(Ac)2/PET ratio 1.5%. The main products of catalytic depolymerization were identified and quantified as terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography. The maximum yield of terephthalic acid reached 90.5%. The phase behavior of PET with or without a catalyst in water during heating and cooling was studied in a fused-silica capillary reactor. According to the phase change data, the temperature of PET dissolution in HCW to form a homogeneous aqueous solution was decreased by adding Zn(Ac)2.","The study involves catalytic depolymerization of waste PET plastic in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Recycling of polystyrene-based external thermal insulation composite systems – Application of combined mechanical and chemical recycling The material recycling of complex waste streams such as external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS) is challenging, which is why their recycling in the sense of a circular economy is currently hardly established. Therefore, the combined mechanical and thermochemical recycling of ETICS based on expanded polystyrene (EPS) is investigated experimentally and by simulating full process chains in order to evaluate circular economy opportunities. Model ETICS as example for building and construction waste is pretreated mechanically, followed by either pyrolysis and / or gasification steps, and full mass and energy balances are derived. By the combined recycling, inorganic compounds can be separated to a large extent allowing a pre-concentrate generation. The plastic-rich pre-concentrate is converted into either pyrolysis oil with a high styrene monomer content of 51 wt% or to synthesis gas in the subsequent thermochemical conversions. The holistic approach enables a high carbon recycling rate between 53 and 68 wt%. In addition, the investigation reveals technology limitations and opportunities to be further developed and optimized.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of expanded polystyrene from ETICS, with measurable product yields and composition analysis, including a high styrene monomer content of 51 wt% in the pyrolysis oil."
"On deconvolution for understanding synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polypropylene The synergistic effects on syngas observed in co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polypropylene (PP) were systematically investigated on a fixed bed reactor with tailored feedstock configurations in this paper. The synergistic effects focused on evolutionary and cumulative behaviors of evolved syngas were quantified by juxtaposing the results from co-pyrolysis of pinewood-PP mixtures with weighted results from the pyrolysis of pinewood and PP as individual components. Examination of different feedstock configurations revealed quantified contributions on volatile interactions and catalytic effect of char to the overall synergy. Results showed that syngas yield, H2 yield and CO yield with co-pyrolysis were promoted by 27%, 80% and 63%, respectively, as compared to the weighted aggregates from individual pyrolysis. Reduced char residue and improved energy yield in co-pyrolysis contributed to a remarkable enhancement in apparent thermal efficiency from 69.93% to 80.67%. Interactions between volatiles evolved from pinewood and PP suppressed C n H m formation while significantly enhancing H2 and CO yields. Mutual interactions between the volatiles accelerated the evolution of each gas component during co-pyrolysis. Pinewood char showed a negligible catalytic effect in evenly mixed configuration, but this effect was pronounced in separated PP and pinewood char. The porous structure of pinewood char can be easily blocked by the fused PP during co-pyrolysis, which was responsible for the delayed C n H m and syngas evolution. This paper provides results that help assist to elucidate the detailed synergistic mechanism during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) and pinewood, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of syngas and char."
"Waxy polyethylenes from solution thermolysis of high density polyethylene: inert and H-donor solvent dilution effect High density polyethylene batch thermolysis has been performed in dilute solutions to obtain waxy products with number-average molar masses in the range of 2000 to 6000gmol−1. In relation to a classical bulk thermolysis (390°C, 6h) which affords branched waxy polymers, dilution with phenylether permits controlled diffusion reactions modifying the product characteristics: low molar masses, narrow distribution, high crystallinity, rich in α-olefins and few long branching formation. A hydrogen donor solvent (tetralin), acting on the free radical degradation pathway, affords a lower fragmentation level of the main chains and short chains branching. In addition, a high level of tetralyl radicals grafting on the α-olefin is observed. Adjustment of the process conditions might give tailor-made waxy polymers to use just as they are or after chemical modifications of the olefinic functions.","The study involves lab-scale batch thermolysis of high-density polyethylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable product characteristics, solvent effects, and product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis of municipal plastic wastes: Influence of raw material composition The objective of this work is the study of pyrolysis as a feedstock recycling process, for valorizing the rejected streams that come from industrial plants, where packing and packaging wastes are classified and separated for their subsequent mechanical recycling. Four real samples collected from an industrial plant at four different times of the year, have been pyrolysed under nitrogen in a 3.5dm3 autoclave at 500°C for 30min. Pyrolysis liquids are a complex mixture of organic compounds containing valuable chemicals as styrene, ethyl-benzene, toluene, etc. Pyrolysis solids are composed of the inorganic material contained in the raw materials, as well as of some char formed in the pyrolysis process, and pyrolysis gases are mainly composed of hydrocarbons together with some CO and CO2, and have very high gross calorific values (GCV). It has been proved by the authors that the composition of the raw material (paper, film, and metals contents) plays a significant role in the characteristics of pyrolysis products. High paper content yields water in the pyrolysis liquids, and CO and CO2 in the gases, high PE film content gives rise to high viscosity liquids, and high metals content yields more aromatics in the liquid products, which may be attributed to the metals catalytic effect.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real municipal plastic waste samples at 500°C with measurable product yields and compositional analysis of oil, gas, and char, including catalyst-like effects of metals."
"Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood and polypropylene for hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil based on multilayer MFI nanosheets catalysis This research examined the microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood (EW) and polypropylene (PP) to obtain hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil utilizing hydrogen-type multilayer MFI nanosheets (HMMN) catalysts. Firstly, the catalytic properties of HMMN and HZSM-5 in microwave field were compared. Compared with HZSM-5, the proportion of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in products catalyzed by HMMN increased by 5.5 times, and the proportion of oxygenates reduced by 67 %. Secondly, the influence of catalytic temperature and catalyst dosage on the yields and composition of bio-oil was investigated under the catalysis of HMMN. At a catalytic temperature of 550 °C, the greatest yields of bio-oil (25.82 wt%) and MAHs in bio-oil products (24.17 %) were obtained. Furthermore, when HMMN was added at a dosage of 150 wt%, the relative yield of MAHs reached its peak (26.16 %). Finally, the mechanism of microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of EW and PP based on HMMN catalysis was analyzed. Due to its elevated B/L value and abundant mesoporous volume, HMMN exhibited exceptional aromatization and deoxidation properties in the microwave field. Microwave field activation of free radicals generated by pyrolysis of EW and PP promotes the generation of benzene ring derivatives. HMMN catalysis in microwave field further enhances the selectivity of MAHs.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) and eucalyptus wood with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Fast pyrolysis in a novel wire-mesh reactor: Design and initial results Pyrolysis is known to occur by decomposition processes followed by vapour phase reactions. The goal of this research is to develop a novel device to study the initial decomposition processes. For this, a novel wire-mesh reactor was constructed. A small sample (<0.1g) was clamped between two meshes that were heated fast (up to 10000°C/s, ΔT mesh ±35°C) by an electrical current. The mesh/feedstock was placed inside a vacumized (P <0.3mbar), liquid nitrogen cooled vessel (T wall <−80°C). These two last features were proven to result in a low vapour life time (<15–25ms versus ∼2s in typical pyrolysis). The vapour residence time and temperature could be increased by increasing the pressure inside the reactor and by removing of the liquid nitrogen cooling. Reproducible results concerning yields (mass balance closures 90–110wt%) and analysis were obtained (oil by SEC and NMR, gas by GC, char by FTIR). The yields and oil composition were changing with loading from 0.05g to 0.1g, despite the small sample amounts. Compared to more “conventional” pyrolysis processes, high oil yields (84wt%), very low char yields (5wt%) and low gas yields (8wt%) were obtained. Using a high speed camera, movies were made and together with accompanying pressure profiles, it was possible to estimate the conversion rate. At 500°C the conversion process was finished within 0.8s which is faster than previously reported in the literature. Especially an increase in gas yield (+14wt%, mainly CO) was observed in absence of cooling (P vac/No Cooling), while both the gas (+4wt%) and char yield (+3wt%) increased under atmospheric pressure (P atm/Cooling), all at the expense of oil yield. Compared to more “conventional” pyrolysis oil, the oil did contain: (i) heavier molecules and (ii) a sugar fraction.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic waste using a novel wire-mesh reactor with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and varying reactor conditions."
"Co-pyrolysis of beech wood and polyamide-6: Impact of plastic concentration and wood/plastic synergistic effects Biomass residues and waste can be converted into bioliquids by pyrolysis, which can contribute to both the production of renewable fuels and the recycling of waste. In this paper, the catalytic co-pyrolysis of mixtures of beech wood (BW) and polyamide-6 (PA6) in different ratios was investigated to assess the effect of PA6 concentration on the properties of bio-oils and on the catalyst performances in upgrading the bio-oils. The catalytic treatment was applied to the pyrolysis vapors that were driven across a H-ZSM-5 catalyst bed before their condensation into liquid products. Increasing the PA6 concentration in the BW+PA6 blends led to an increase in the average molar mass of bio-oils and to an increase in their N-content. Caprolactam and 5-cyano-1-pentene were the main products derived from PA6 pyrolysis, and their ratio also changed with the PA6 concentration. The production of fully deoxygenated compounds was strongly reduced in the presence of PA6, as the result of catalyst deactivation, also evidenced by the increase in sugars and decrease in furans concentrations. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst decreased as the PA6 concentration increased, but this coke contained more nitrogen. Synergistic effects in the BW+PA6 pyrolysis were evidenced by the positive or negative deviation of different parameters (mass of gas, liquid, solid products, mass of coke on the catalyst, C, N, O composition of bio-oils) from a simple arithmetic combination of the same parameters for pure BW or pure PA6 weighted by their concentrations, in particular the N-content in the bio-oils was much higher than expected.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste polyamide-6 and beech wood, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and compositional analysis of bio-oils."
"Catalytical and thermal pyrolysis of polyolefins Polyolefins have a high potential for alternative oil production since they contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms. By pyrolysis of these materials up to 95% can be obtained as oil and gas. Upgrading the products by catalytic cracking of polyolefins is a subject of growing interest in the last years as less energy is needed for the pyrolysis and more valuable products are formed. Numerous studies have been reported in which a variety of catalysts such as zeolites, silica-alumina, mesoporous MCM-41, solid acids and reaction conditions have been investigated. In our studies we used Lewis acids and mixtures of Ziegler–Natta catalyst such as TiCl4, AlCl3 to pyrolyse polypropylene. Experiments were carried out in a batch reactor as well as in a fluidized bed process. The pyrolysis temperature can be decreased by 100°C compared to runs without catalysts. A drastic increase in the amount of low boiling compounds (C4 hydrocarbons) can be observed by the use of the catalysts instead of longer chained hydrocarbons.","The study involves catalytic and thermal pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, in lab-scale reactors with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships."
"Coupling carbon dioxide and magnetite for the enhanced thermolysis of polyvinyl chloride To valorize plastic wastes, pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was conducted as a case study. In an effort to build the more sustainable pyrolysis platform for PVC, CO2 was particularly employed as a reactive gas medium, and magnetite (Fe3O4) was used to explore the feasibility of enhancing CO2-assisted PVC pyrolysis. The favorable effect of Fe3O4 on syngas generation from pyrolysis of PVC was apparent to yield highest concentration of H2 (0.28 mol% at 590 °C) and CO (4.34 mol% at 800 °C) in the presence of 0.1 g Fe3O4/1 g PVC. The GC-TOF analysis of tar generated from thermal decomposition of PVC evidenced more breakdown of PVC hydrocarbons in the presence of Fe3O4, which led to the enhanced production of syngas. In the presence of 0.01 g Fe3O4, the evolution of CO was observed at lower temperature (7.1 mol% at 680 °C) than the case without Fe3O4, and further addition of Fe3O4 up to 0.5 g gradually increased the CO level in the latter stage of pyrolysis (up to 4.5 mol% at 900 °C), which is attributed to the enhanced Boudouard reaction. Good adsorption ability of biochar products was also demonstrated in the removal of methylene blue. Collectively, the use of Fe3O4 in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of plastics could open the possibility of utilizing waste plastics in thermo-chemical process for energy recovery and environmental application.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waste using a reactive gas medium (CO2) and magnetite catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent syngas production, and analytical characterization via GC-TOF."
"Sustainable production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes/nanofibers from plastic waste through microwave degradation Plastic waste pyrolysis to clean energy (H2) and valuable carbon nanotubes or nanofibers (CNTs/CNFs) is the most promising waste management and energy regeneration process. In this study, microwave-mediated single-step pyrolysis is used to produce COx-free hydrogen and CNTs/CNFs from real-world plastic films. Nickel, iron, and cobalt-based catalysts were prepared by the incipient wet-impregnation method and tested for real-world polyethylene plastic film degradation. In addition, the quality of CNTs produced and hydrogen yield were also compared for these catalysts. Various characterization tools were used to characterize the calcined catalysts, spent catalysts, and CNTs. Further, the effect of temperature ramp rate on hydrogen yield and CNTs properties was also analyzed. The results show that the iron-based catalyst produces a high yield of hydrogen and low-diameter and uniform-quality CNTs compared to other catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of real-world polyethylene plastic film with measurable yields of hydrogen and CNTs, catalyst performance comparison, and detailed characterization of products and catalysts."
"Single step microwaves assisted catalytic conversion of plastic waste into valuable fuel and carbon nanotubes The deconstruction of plastic waste into hydrogen, carbonaceous materials and hydrocarbons is an attractive way of meeting the global energy demand. This paper presents single-step microwave pyrolysis of high-density plastic waste using different catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For catalytic pyrolysis, NiFe2O4, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 catalysts were prepared through a facile sol-gel method. The highest hydrogen yield was recorded with NiFe2O4 catalyst, which is about 57 mmol.g−1. The hydrogen production efficiency was about 93 wt.%. In comparison to polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), the polystyrenes (PS) produced the highest yield of solid carbon (73 wt.%) with NiFe2O4 catalyst. The produced CNTs were characterized through XRD, TEM, SEM, TGA and RAMAN spectroscopy. The NiFe2O4 catalyst produced relatively pure and well-structured CNTs as compared to Al2O3 and Fe2O3 catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of HDPE and PS waste plastics with measurable yields of hydrogen and solid carbon, including catalytic performance and product characterization."
"Pyrolysis of waste printed circuit board fragments: Response surface methodology optimization and effect of temperature on product characteristics The direct pyrolysis of waste printed circuit board (WPCB) produces metal-enriched char, while its polymer fraction converts to valuable gas and liquid fractions. However, the low amount of organic fraction produces less liquid yield. Thus, the current study is focused on optimizing the pyrolysis parameters (temperature, heating rate, and hold time) towards maximum liquid and minimum solid (char) yields using response surface methodology (RSM). The purpose of the objective functions is to completely remove the organic material and convert most of it to liquid fraction while producing metal-enriched char. The RSM study was employed using a face-centered central composite design (CCD). The responses were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the quadratic model was found to be the best-fit model. The ‘temperature’ was found to be the most significant parameter. Hence, further experiments were conducted by varying the temperature, keeping the heating rate and hold time constant, and the obtained products were subjected to detailed characterization. The obtained liquid samples were rich in aromatics with high calorific value (∼35 MJ/kg) and produced gases like H2 and CH4. This study provides a comprehensive approach, integrating both qualitative and quantitative analyses, to optimize WPCB pyrolysis for enhanced resource recovery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste printed circuit board fragments, a type of mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed characterization of liquid products."
"In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste in the rotary kiln with solid heat carrier coupled with Ni/ZSM-5: Selectivity of BTX enriched oil and energetic evaluation Catalytic pyrolysis offers an efficient pathway for transforming plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or chemicals through directional regulation, mitigating plastic pollution, and achieving high-value utilization of plastic. This study introduces a novel in-situ catalytic pyrolysis approach utilizing a rotary kiln system integrated with a solid heat carrier and Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, aimed at improving benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) yields while simultaneously generating hydrogen as a by-product. The effects of Ni loading (0–20 wt%) on ZSM-5 and catalyst-to-plastic mass ratios (Cat:MP = 0.5–2) on product distribution were systematically investigated. Additionally, thermodynamic efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the process were comprehensively evaluated through integrated exergy analysis and exergoeconomic assessment. The results demonstrated that Ni modification significantly improved BTX selectivity, with 10Ni/ZSM-5 achieving a peak BTX content of 52.4 % in pyrolysis oil, while 20Ni/ZSM-5 enhanced hydrogen yield to 45.1 vol%. Reducing Cat:MPratios from 2 to 0.5 increased monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) content from 63.5 % to 79.0 %, suppressing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation. Exergy analysis revealed a total process efficiency of 83.0–83.7 %, with pyrolysis oil contributing 22.4–23.7 MJ/kg of exergy. Exergoeconomic evaluation highlighted the dominance of catalyst costs, where unitary exergoeconomic costs surged from 279.1 to 1082.2 USD/GJ as Cat:MPincreased. Optimal performance was achieved at Cat:MP = 1, balancing oil yield (57.8 wt%) and economic feasibility (Cpo = 22.4 USD/kg). This work provides a sustainable pathway for plastic waste valorization by integrating efficient BTX enrichment, hydrogen co-production, and energy self-sufficiency, offering critical insights into catalyst design and process optimization for industrial-scale applications.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste in a rotary kiln with measurable yields, product composition, catalyst performance, and reactor conditions."
"Study of the deactivation process of HZSM5 zeolite during polyethylene pyrolysis The deactivation process of HZSM5 zeolite during the catalytic degradation of LDPE and HDPE has been studied by repeated batch operation using the same sample of catalyst in consecutive cycles until almost a total loss in the activity of the catalyst was observed. The gaseous and condensed products generated in each cycle were analysed as well as the coked catalyst obtained. They were characterized by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77K, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and thermogravimetric analysis. The deactivation process of HZSM5 depends on the type of polyethylene used. With LDPE the zeolite showed a slow deactivation. In the first four consecutive cycles the coke deposit increased, significantly changing the properties of the catalyst although the yield of gaseous and condensed products remained nearly constant throughout. From the fifth cycle on no more coke was deposited on the catalyst but the composition of products changed progressively, tending to that obtained in a thermal process. This behaviour could be related to the change in coke composition because of the effect of the temperature and the time. On the other hand, with HDPE, a clear relationship of the coke content, acidity, activity and textural properties of the catalyst with the products generated was observed.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and HDPE) in a lab-scale batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst characterization, and analysis of deactivation over consecutive cycles."
"Perspective on the disposal of PVC artificial leather via pyrolysis: Thermodynamics, kinetics, synergistic effects and reaction mechanism With the massive production and discard of PVC artificial leather, it is urgently needed to find an efficient and environment-friendly method to dispose of this material made from PVC and blended cloth (BC). As a widely accepted way to dispose of municipal solid waste, pyrolysis was chosen for this study. The pyrolysis experiments of PVC, BC, and their mixture were conducted to characterize PVC artificial leather’s pyrolysis behavior and product characteristics. TG-FTIR and kinetics analysis showed the strong synergistic effect between PVC and cellulose in BC occurred at 240 °C – 314 °C, resulting in cellulose dehydration and aromatization. An exceptionally high tar yield of 54.96 wt% was obtained by fast pyrolysis of the mixture at 500 °C. GC–MS analysis of tar proved BC consisted of cellulose, PET, and PA. The high tar yield of co-pyrolysis came from the synergistic effects of PVC on cellulose and PET, both of which formed terephthalic acid, di(2-chloroethyl) ester (TADE). At 500 °C, the tar of the mixture mainly contained TADE (18.72 wt%), terephthalic acid (18.56 wt%), and aromatics (19.04 wt%). The co-pyrolysis interaction mechanism at 500 °C was deduced. Our study could provide theoretical guidance for recycling PVC artificial leather waste.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PVC artificial leather, a waste plastic material, with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and reactor conditions explicitly reported."
"Production of hydrogen-rich gaseous product from pyrolysis of polypropylene wastes using bauxite ore catalyst: yield analysis of various products The article investigates the extraction of superior-quality pyrolytic oil (PO) with considerable yield and hydrogen-rich gaseous mixtures from the pyrolysis of polypropylene waste (PPW) with and without a catalyst. Considering the presence of a mixture of metal oxides in low-cost bauxite ore, its catalytic activity towards the quality and quantity of PO and the composition of syngas has been explored experimentally. A positive selectivity towards the reduced temperature (about 10 °C) degradation of PPW with catalysts has been identified during the thermogravimetric (TGA) study. A batch reactor study was conducted with PPW with varied proportions of catalyst, temperatures (525 °C–600 °C), and heating rates (5, 10, and 15 °C/min) to quantify the effects of process conditions on end products’ characteristics and to identify the optimal process parameters. The pyrolysis temperature of 575 °C at 15 °C/min with 10 % catalyst produced the superior quality PO. The corresponding yields of PO and gaseous products were 75.14 % and 17.16 %, respectively. The analysis of PO by FTIR and GC-MS showed higher concentrations of lighter hydrocarbons suitable for gasoline range fuel, namely 2, 4-dimethyl heptane, 2, 6-dimethyl-nonane, and 2, 4-dimethyl-1-heptene, in addition to aromatics. The GC test of gaseous products showed that the presence of bauxite ore significantly enhanced the hydrogen recovery in gaseous products compared to thermal pyrolysis alone. Under optimum conditions, the hydrogen content in the gaseous product reached up to 9.8 %, fulfilling the primary aim of the study. Bauxite ore has a promising catalytic activity, making the process sustainable for hydrogen-rich gaseous products and gasoline range PO from PPW. The study backs circular economy activities by promoting the scientific use of plastic garbage for converting it into value-added clean fuels.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene waste using a batch reactor with measurable yields, catalyst effects, and product characterization via GC-MS, FTIR, and TGA."
"Morphological characteristics of waste polyethylene/polypropylene plastics during pyrolysis and representative morphological signal characterizing pyrolysis stages In this work, the morphological characteristics of waste polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) plastics during their pyrolysis process were investigated, and based on their basic image changing patterns representative morphological signals describing the pyrolysis stages were obtained. PE and PP granules and films were used as typical plastics for testing, and influence of impurities was also investigated. During pyrolysis experiments, photographs of the testing samples were taken sequentially with a high-speed infrared camera, and the quantitative parameters that describe the morphological characteristics of these photographs were explored using the “Image Pro Plus (v6.3)” digital image processing software. The experimental results showed that plastics pyrolysis involved four stages: melting, two stages of decomposition which are characterized with bubble formation caused by volatile evaporating, and ash deposition; and each stage was characterized with its own phase changing behaviors and morphological features. Two stages of decomposition are the key step of pyrolysis since they took up half or more of the reaction time; melting step consumed another half of reaction time in experiments when raw materials were heated up from ambient temperatures; and coke-like deposition appeared as a result of decomposition completion. Two morphological signals defined from digital image processing, namely, pixel area of the interested reaction region and bubble ratio (BR) caused by volatile evaporating were found to change regularly with pyrolysis stages. In particular, for all experimental scenarios with plastics films and granules, the BR curves always exhibited a slowly drop as melting started and then a sharp increase followed by a deep decrease corresponding to the first stage of intense decomposition, afterwards a second increase – drop section corresponding to the second stage of decomposition appeared. As ash deposition happened, the BR dropped to zero or very low values. When impurities were involved, the shape of BR curves showed that intense decomposition started earlier but morphological characteristics remained the same. In addition, compared to parameters such as pressure, the BR reflects reaction stages better and its change with pyrolysis process of PE/PP plastics with or without impurities was more intrinsically process correlated; therefore it can be adopted as a signal for pyrolysis process characterization, as well as offering guide to process improvement and reactor design.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and polypropylene plastics with measurable morphological data, temperature-dependent stage characterization, and quantitative analysis using image processing."
"Effect of pre-devulcanization and temperature on physical and chemical properties of waste tire pyrolytic oil residue The effect of pre-devulcanization and temperature in waste tire pyrolysis are investigated on pyrolysis time, yield and properties of residual Heavy Fraction Pyrolytic Oil (HFPO). A comparative pyrolysis of usual Ground Tire Rubber (GTR) and a commercial devulcanized ground tire rubber, (known as Reclaim Rubber-RR) is performed in a static-bed batch reactor at 400–600°C and the oil is distillated to light and heavy fractions. Chemical composition studies show higher amounts of aromatics in HFPO than light fraction. As a novel approach, a relationship between isotherm at max temperature and pyrolysis temperature is presented in this work. Pyrolysis time for RR is approximately half of GTR at same temperatures due to RR devulcanized nature. The solid yield is larger for GTR than RR and decreases by temperature. The liquid yield for RR is larger than GTR. Pyrolysis time and liquid yields of GTR and RR approach to each other at higher temperatures. Kinematic viscosity and flash point are larger for GTR oils in comparison with RR. FTIR shows by increasing temperature the ratio of alkanes/aromatic (I 2952/I 1456) decreased for HR and increased for HG. So it can be said that both oil contain similar functional groups at different concentrations depending on temperature. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra shows oils are a mixture of aromatics, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes and ethers or alcohols, which exist in different concentrations. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) shows that pyrolysis of GTR produces oil which is heavier and broader in Mw distribution in comparison with pre-devulcanized sample (RR). Elemental analysis shows similar elemental composition of HFPOs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tire rubber (a plastic waste material) in a batch reactor with measurable yields, temperature-dependent product properties, and detailed analytical characterization including FTIR, NMR, GPC, and elemental analysis."
"A novelty catalytic reforming of tire pyrolysis oil for hydrogen-rich syngas Pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis char from waste tires have been reported with poor quality but could be a source and catalyst for generating hydrogen-rich syngas, respectively. In this study, the influence of two-layer catalysts on the catalytic reforming syngas distribution derived from side wall rubber pyrolysis oil (SWRPO) was explored. The side wall rubber pyrolysis char (SWRC), as a catalyst and carrier support of nickel, was used as the first-layer catalyst, and the calcined bottom ash (CBA) from oil sludge combustion was used as the secondary catalyst. Steam was used as an activator to activate SWRC and improve the concentration of CO and H2 in catalytic reforming syngas. Different analysis methods (BET, XRD, SEM, and Raman) were employed to characterize the properties of catalysts. Consequently, the yield and LHV of syngas increased from 0.05 g·goil −1 and 2.03 kJ·g−1 to 0.42 g·goil −1 and 11.32 kJ·g−1, respectively. The H2 concentration increased from 20.38 vol% to 44.68 vol% in syngas with two-layer catalysts, and the H2 selectivity reached 0.16. The yield of carbon deposit increased to 0.57 g·goil −1 with the SWRPO total conversion of 95.55 %. The lifetime of two-layer catalysts reached 17 h with a stability conversion process of SWRPO.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tires to produce oil and char, followed by catalytic reforming of the pyrolysis oil to generate hydrogen-rich syngas, with measurable yields, product composition, and catalyst performance data."
"A kinetic approach to the temperature-programmed pyrolysis of low- and high-density polyethylene in a fixed bed reactor: determination of kinetic parameters for the evolution of n-paraffins and 1-olefins The thermal degradation of both low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) have been investigated under non-isothermal conditions. The weight loss data have been analyzed by Flynn and Wall methods. The activation energies for overall degradation of LDPE and HDPE were determined. In addition, the recovery of carbon as 1-olefins and n-paraffins was determined by temperature-programmed pyrolysis of polyethylene. A fixed bed reactor under argon flow was used to pyrolyze small samples of LDPE and HDPE. A special gas-phase sampling technique was used to determine the composition of products eluted from the reactor as a function of temperature and time. Hydrocarbon evolution data have been analyzed by Coats–Redfern and Chen–Nuttall combinations. It must be emphasized that the evaluation of temperature-programmed pyrolysis data by combined use of Coats–Redfern and Chen–Nuttall methods provide satisfactory mathematical approaches to obtain kinetic parameters for 1-olefin and n-paraffins formation from degradation of polyethylene. Using this method, it is possible to identify every stage of pyrolysis and derive values for kinetic parameters.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE with measured product yields, temperature-dependent hydrocarbon evolution, and kinetic parameter determination through experimental data analysis."
"High temperature flash pyrolysis characteristics of waste plastics (SRF) in a bubbling fluidized bed: Effect of temperature and pelletizing Utilization of municipal solid waste (MSW) non-recyclable combustible fractions abundant in mixed plastics such as solid recovered fuel (SRF) is becoming increasingly widespread due to its sustainability. This study investigates utilization of pelletized mixed plastic SRF using fluidized bed (FB) flash pyrolysis at high temperature, unlike previous studies that focused on low temperature pyrolysis. The effect of temperature on the pyrolysis of SRF was investigated using an externally heated bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor having an internal diameter of 0.114 m and a height of 1 m. Experiments were conducted with an inert fluidizing agent (N2) in the temperature range of 600–900 °C. The pyrolysis products such as gas, char, and tar were analyzed, and the mass balance was determined. High temperature flash pyrolysis favors production of high LHV product gas unlike previous studies which were mostly focusing on liquids production. The gas yield increases from 0.285 g/gfuel to 0.680 g/gfuel with increasing temperature from 600 °C to 900 °C. GC–MS analysis of the tar revealed that increasing the temperature intensifies the cracking of naphthenes, alcohols, and olefins, and increases the relative percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons up to 85.1 % at 900 °C. When fluffy SRF was pyrolyzed, gas yield was slightly higher than the pelletized SRF at 800 °C suggesting that low temperature gradient increases gas yield and decreases char yield. Fluffy SRF pyrolysis tar also mainly consists of aromatics and esters. The process produces high calorific gas and reveals the reaction mechanisms relevant to gasification processes.","The study involves lab-scale high-temperature flash pyrolysis of waste plastic SRF in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of tar via GC–MS."
"High-temperature pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene for hydrogen production and carbon capture Utilizing low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as a feedstock, non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis represents a promising technology for large-scale hydrogen generation and carbon capture. Furthermore, the use of the solid carbon byproduct generated during the process, enhances the operation’s economic feasibility. This work uses the model compound to reveal the potential of LDPE pyrolysis for producing hydrogen and capturing carbon. A laboratory-scale high-temperature fixed bed reactor is operated in the temperature ranging from 700 °C to 1600 °C, with LDPE pellets of 5 mm in diameter. Despite a decrease in gas yield to 13.7 wt% as the temperature increases, the hydrogen yield significantly increased up to 11.0 wt% from 900 °C to 1600 °C. Approximately two-thirds of the hydrogen present in the polymer was identified as molecular hydrogen in the product gas. At 1600 °C, a purity of 98.5 mol% was achieved for the hydrogen produced, while the product gas at temperatures ranging from 700 °C to 900 °C predominantly contained methane and ethylene. The analysis of the influence of temperature on the condensable product phase demonstrated an increase in the yields of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) species up to a temperature of 1000 °C. The decrease in yield of Aliphatic and PAHs from 1000 °C onwards could be attributed to the gradual decarbonization of the gas phase through the formation of solid carbon. Additionally, the produced solid carbon was analyzed using various techniques, including TEM, SEM, DLS, TGA, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrated its potential as a sustainable industrial carbon material.","The study involves lab-scale high-temperature pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization of products and solid carbon byproduct."
"Pyrolysis of automotive shredder residue in a bench scale rotary kiln Automotive shredder residue (ASR) can create difficulties when managing, with its production increasing. It is made of different type of plastics, foams, elastomers, wood, glasses and textiles. For this reason, it is complicated to dispose of in a cost effective way, while also respecting the stringent environmental restrictions. Among thermal treatments, pyrolysis seems to offer an environmentally attractive method for the treatment of ASR; it also allows for the recovery of valuable secondary materials/fuels such as pyrolysis oils, chars, and gas. While, there is a great deal of significant research on ASR pyrolysis, the literature on higher scale pyrolysis experiments is limited. To improve current literature, the aim of the study was to investigate the pyrolysis of ASR in a bench scale rotary kiln. The Italian ASR was separated by dry-sieving into two particle size fractions: d30mm. Both the streams were grounded, pelletized and then pyrolyzed in a continuous bench scale rotary kiln at 450, 550 and 650°C. The mass flow rate of the ASR pellets was 200–350g/h and each test ran for about 4–5h. The produced char, pyrolysis oil and syngas were quantified to determine product distribution. They were thoroughly analyzed with regard to their chemical and physical properties. The results show how higher temperatures increase the pyrolysis gas yield (44wt% at 650°C) as well as its heating value. The low heating value (LHV) of syngas ranges between 18 and 26MJ/Nm3 dry. The highest pyrolysis oil yield (33wt.%) was observed at 550°C and its LHV ranges between 12.5 and 14.5MJ/kg. Furthermore, only two out of the six produced chars respect the LHV limit set by the Italian environmental regulations for landfilling. The obtained results in terms of product distribution and their chemical-physical analyses provide useful information for plant scale-up.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of automotive shredder residue, a waste plastic mixture, using a bench-scale rotary kiln with measured product yields and detailed chemical-physical analysis of oil, gas, and char."
"Fluidised bed pyrolysis of polypropylene over cracking catalysts for producing hydrocarbons Polypropylene (PP) was pyrolysed over various catalysts using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolite catalysts (HZSM-5>HUSY≈HMOR) was higher than that for non-zeolite catalysts (SAHA≈MCM-41). Product distributions with HZSM-5 contained more olefinic materials with about 60wt% in the range of C3–C5. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffin streams with large amounts of isobutane (i-C4) and both catalysts were deactivated during the course of the degradation. SAHA and MCM-41 showed the lowest conversion and generated an olefin-rich product with a rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. Experiments carried out with various catalysts gave good yields of volatile hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reactor conditions; in particular, olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times. It is demonstrated that under appropriate reaction conditions suitable catalysts can have the ability to control both the product yield and product distribution from polymer degradation, potentially leading to a cheaper process with more valuable products.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized-bed pyrolysis of polypropylene, a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Valorization of plastics and paper mill sludge into carbon composite and its catalytic performance for acarbon material consisted of the multi-layerzo dye oxidation In this work, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and paper mill sludge (PMS) were co-pyrolyzed under two environments of N2 and CO2. The pyrolysis process was assessed by conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and monitoring the evolution of gaseous products. The resulting solid composites were characterized using XRD, XPS, BET, and Raman analyzers, and their ability to catalytically activate persulfate (S2O8 2−) was tested by conducting methyl orange (MO) degradation experiments. Co-pyrolysis of PVC and PMS at the same mass ratio (1:1) in CO2 resulted in the highest production of H2 and CO (0.36 mol % H2 at 480 °C & 1.53 mol % CO at 700 °C). The characterization results revealed that the composite consisted of Fe3O4, highly graphitic carbon, and mesoporous structure. In MO oxidation experiments, the co-pyrolyzed composite actively generated OH and SO4 − by activating S2O8 2− to achieve complete removal of 5 mg L-1 of MO during 100 min at acidic-neutral pH condition. The composite was also able to complete 3 successive cycles of MO oxidation without deactivation. Consequently, the feasibility of achieving the simultaneous production of energy resources and catalyst via industrial wastes utilization in pyrolytic process was demonstrated.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVC) and paper mill sludge, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"Co-pyrolysis of waste polyester enameled wires and polyvinyl chloride: Evolved products and pyrolysis mechanism analysis Waste enameled copper wire is an important secondary source of copper and often recovered by removing their organic paint layer through pyrolysis. This research focused on studying co-pyrolysis behaviors of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) paint of waste enameled wires, mixed with a small amount of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is part of electric wires or cables. The results indicated that mixing PVC with a mass fraction of 10% into enameled PET wire paint (EPET) would significantly affect pyrolysis products, especially the chlorinated compounds, as well as increase energy consumption of the pyrolysis process. TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS analyses showed that the chlorinated organics were mainly generated in the second stage of pyrolysis. Chloroesters such as terephthalic acid, di(2-chloroethyl) ester were dominant over other chloroorganic compounds, and their formations were attributed to the addition reaction of aromatic vinyl esters with HCl which formed from PVC pyrolysis. It is also worth mentioning that the chemically active acid chlorides including propanoyl chloride and benzoyl chloride were detected in the products, and they were proposed to be formed from the HCl acidolysis of esters that produced from pyrolytic EPET. Besides pyrolysis products, energy consumption of pyrolysis process also was closely correlated to the interactions between pyrolytic PVC and EPET. The average co-pyrolysis activation energy was calculated by Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and was about 15 kJ/mol higher than that of EPET. These should be consequences of reactions between HCl and EPET. Since PVC is the minority component in the pyrolysis mixture that HCl eliminated from the few PVC was mostly consumed by EPET to form chloroorganic compounds, which negatively influences EPET degradation.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PET and PVC) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization using TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS."
"Vacuum pyrolysis of commingled plastics containing PVC II. Product analysis Vacuum pyrolysis of individual plastics including high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) has been performed at a final temperature of 500°C and under a total pressure of 2 kPa. A PVC sample and a commingled plastic sample composed of HDPE/LDPE/PP/PS/PVC have been pyrolyzed in two consecutive steps at 360 and 520°C in order to separately trap HCl. A pyrolysis set-up consisting of a bench scale batch reactor with a condensation train was used to collect the pyrolysis products. The main gaseous and liquid products, including the chlorinated hydrocarbons, were identified by chromatography. Global and chlorine mass balances were performed. The yields and pyrolysis product composition from each single polymer were compared with those from the commingled plastics. At 520°C, 99.55 wt.% of the total chlorine was trapped as HCl corresponding to 4.6 wt.% in yield, on an original feedstock basis, followed by 62.0 wt.% wax, 31.1 wt.% oil, 1.0 wt.% gas and 1.2 wt.% solid char residue (loss was 0.1 wt.%). The pyrolysis oil contained 12 ppm Cl on a pyrolysis oil basis. This value was less than what was expected (153 ppm) from the theoretical values which were calculated when the individual polymers were pyrolysed. The chlorinated hydrocarbons formed during the pyrolysis of commingled plastics were different from those obtained during the thermal decomposition of pure PVC. However, the hydrocarbons produced in the oil fraction were similar to those identified during the pyrolysis of the single plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PVC) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and reactor conditions specified."
"Conversion of refuse derived fuel from municipal solid waste into valuable chemicals using advanced thermo-chemical process In this study, thermo-chemical decomposition of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) from municipal solid waste pre-treatment plant has been conducted in pyrolytic conditions. Due to high heterogeneity, individual RDF samples are not necessarily representative of the full variety of different components present. To overcome this, five different samples of RDF with varying compositions were treated in a rotary kiln reactor. RDF feed has been characterized based on the amount of biomass and plastic content. Product (oil & char) composition and quality were analysed using different characterization techniques. It was observed that the quality of pyrolysis products varied with the feed composition and operating temperature. Maximum oil yield of oil ∼43% was obtained from RDF containing ∼77% of plastics at 500 °C. This study showed that the interaction of RDF components has a major role in the pyrolysis oil composition. The oil phase mainly consisted of n-aliphatic, branched aliphatic compounds and primary alcohols while, the aqueous phase consisted of organic acids, furans, methanol, phenols, and their derivatives along with ketones. At higher temperatures, the phenolic compounds decreased and the alcohol content was found to increase. Using solvent extraction, phenolic compounds were extracted with hexane while, ketones and acids were extracted using acetone. With high plastic content (∼85%), the char yield reduced from 55% to 30% with increase in temperature. Char samples consisted of different functional groups such as –OH and –COOH along with the micronutrients such as K, Mg and P, with pH in the range of 7.8–9.5 making it suitable for soil applications. Detailed chemical composition analysis of pyrolysis oil and char is the key to design pyrolysis process and evaluating its importance for producing the value-added chemicals.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic-rich refuse derived fuel (RDF) in a rotary kiln reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed chemical characterization of oil and char."
"Sustainable synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes from waste polystyrene using alumina-supported single and bimetallic catalyst In this work, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are synthesised from waste polymer (polystyrene) using alumina-supported single and bimetallic catalysts in a two-stage reactor. Waste polystyrene was efficiently converted into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a two-step pyrolysis-decomposition method. The sol-gel method was used to synthesize a series of single metallic (Ni, Fe, and Co) and bimetallic catalysts, Fe:Ni, Co:Ni, and Fe:Co, with active metals in the ratios 1:3, 3:1, and 1:1. Mo served as the promoter, and Al2O3 as the catalyst support. Catalyst characterization techniques such as BET analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed. The catalytic activity of each synthesised catalyst was evaluated based on the yield and quality of the resulting MWCNTs. With better graphitization and fewer structural flaws, Ni/Mo/Al₂O₃ showed the highest quality of MWCNTs produced among all catalysts. Due to its high surface area, mesoporosity, and efficient metal dispersion, the Ni/Mo/Al₂O₃ catalyst demonstrated the highest performance, generating uniform, fine-diameter MWCNTs (20–40 nm) with high yield (65 %), outstanding graphitization (lowest ID/IG ratio of 0.55), and superior crystallinity. The crystalline nature of the CNTs was validated by structural investigation using XRD, with diffraction peaks corresponding to graphite (002) and (100) reflections. Lower ID/IG ratios in MWCNTs using single-metal catalysts, Ni and Fe based catalysts, suggested greater graphitization and fewer defects, but bimetallic catalysts showed larger defect density, according to Raman spectroscopy, which shed light on structural quality. Polycrystalline structures with well-ordered graphene layers were revealed by Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns, confirming the synthesised CNTs' are graphitic origin. Because of the synergistic effect of Ni's strong graphitization ability and Fe's high carbon solubility, Fe:Ni (1:3)/Mo/Al₂O₃ produced the highest CNT yield, with a maximum MWCNT yield of 69 %.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste polystyrene (a commercial plastic) in a lab-scale two-stage reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Tunable product selectivity in co-pyrolysis of mixed plastics: Enhancing olefin selectivity and optimizing oil yield via synergistic effects The co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) offers a novel strategy for the selective conversion of waste plastics into high-value olefins.This study investigates the pyrolysis characteristics, kinetic parameter calculations, synergistic interactions, and product distributions of HDPE/LDPE mixtures at ratios of 1:1 (HL11), 1:3 (HL13), and 3:1 (HL31), and reveals the underlying mechanism by which synergistic effects govern product selectivity during co-pyrolysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the HDPE/LDPE mixture with a 3:1 ratio (HL31) exhibits the most significant synergistic enhancement. The co-pyrolysis of HL31 shows the lowest activation energy (212.44 kJ mol−1), consistent with the random nucleation and growth model (A 3/2 ). Product analysis further reveals that the HL31 pyrolysis achieves an oil yield as high as 85 %. The interaction between free radicals generated from HDPE and LDPE decomposition suppresses alkane formation while promoting the retention of olefins, thereby enhancing the overall yield of olefins such as 2,4-dimethyl-1-decene and 1-decene. This study elucidates the ratio-dependent synergistic mechanism in HDPE/LDPE co-pyrolysis, providing a theoretical basis for the selective conversion of mixed plastic waste. By tuning the component ratio, simultaneous optimization of pyrolysis oil yield and olefin selectivity can be achieved, advancing the industrial application of plastic recycling technologies.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics HDPE and LDPE, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent kinetics, and analytical characterization of oil and olefin composition."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin waste into valuable hydrocarbons over reused catalyst from refinery FCC units A commingled polyethylene/polypropylene (PE/PP) mixture was pyrolysed over used fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) commercial equilibrium catalyst (RCat-c1) using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The conversion at 390°C for RCat-c1 catalyst (81.5wt%) gave much higher yield than silicate (only 18.3wt%). Greater product selectivity was observed with RCat-c1 as a post-use catalyst with about 53wt% olefins products in the C3–C6 range. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reaction conditions. Valuable hydrocarbons of olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times used in this study. It is demonstrated that the use of spent FCC commercial catalyst and under appropriate reaction conditions can have the ability to control both the product yield and product distribution from polymer degradation, potentially leading to a cheaper process with more valuable products.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste PE/PP plastics using a fluidized-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"A comparative assessment of single cylinder diesel engine characteristics with plasto-oils derived from municipal mixed plastic waste Recycling of municipal mixed plastic waste (MPW) is an emerging technology for conversion of waste to wealth. In the current study, MPW was processed to produce plasto-oils (PO1 and PO2) by thermochemical depolymerization in a batch production of 0.5 ton/batch. These oils were used in a 3.7 kW rated power single cylinder direct injection compression ignition (CI) engine to assess performance, combustion and emission behavior of the engine. The experimental results with plasto-oils were compared with base diesel fuel operation at different brake mean effective pressures (BMEPs) of 1.8, 3.8, 5.8, 7.8 and 10.8 bar. It is explored that brake thermal efficiency of the test engine with plasto-oils was almost comparable with the diesel fuel at all engine loads. Carbon based emissions such as unburnt hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke emissions from the engine at 3.8–10.8 bar BMEPs were slightly higher with plasto-oils than diesel fuel. Nitrogen oxides emission decreased faintly with the use of plasto-oils at medium and high BMEPs (5.8–10.8 bar). However, at lower BMEPs (1.8–3.8 bar), emission behavior of the engine (HC, CO, smoke and NOx emissions) was same with all kinds of fuels (diesel, PO1 and PO2). Overall, it is ascertained from the study that the plasto-oils exhibited a comparable performance with the conventional diesel fuel, which further promises its viability to use as a fuel candidate for CI engines.","The study involves pyrolysis of municipal mixed plastic waste to produce plasto-oils, with measurable product yields and engine performance data from lab-scale experiments."
"The effects of pore structures and functional groups on the catalytic performance of activated carbon catalysts for the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic into aromatics and hydrogen-rich syngas The catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir and low-density polyethylene over different activated carbons (AC) was conducted using a fixed bed reactor, and the roles of AC pore structures and active functional groups in product yields and compositions was explored. While the liquid yield varied in the range of 36.7%–50.0%, the maximum yield was obtained using an H3PO4 activated AC catalyst. The AC catalysts activated by steam had well-developed micro-mesoporous structures dominated by micropores, which displayed high selectivity towards mono-aromatics. Whereas, the AC catalysts activated by H3PO4 exhibited additional mesoporous properties and P-containing functional groups, providing adequate space and reactive sites for converting bulky co-pyrolytic intermediates into double-ring aromatics, which were accompanied by the release of hydrogen (up to 80.6 vol%). A synergistic catalytic effect during co-pyrolysis promoted gas production at the expense of liquid. All the AC catalysts enhanced aromatics formation and reduced the yield of oxygenates and > C16 aliphatic hydrocarbons. In contrast to H3PO4 activated AC catalysts, steam activated AC catalysts exhibited a negative effect on hydrogen production, indicating different synergistic pathways during co-pyrolysis. These findings provide a reference for improving the catalytic activity of AC catalysts by regulating the pore structure and functional groups.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (plastic) and biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Chemical recycling of multi-materials from glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) Multi-materials, such as payment or access cards commonly in circulation, are non-recyclable. We show that the adoption of glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET-G) as an alternative thermoplastic enables a transition from the current linear economy to a sustainable circular economy for these multi-materials. For the first time, we demonstrate the chemical recycling of PET-G. The system promotes effective depolymerization of both pure PET-G streams and PET-G multi-materials. Higher catalyst loading enables fast depolymerization kinetics and exceptional selectivity for mixed plastics under mild conditions, with up to 93% BHET conversion. Extending this process to multi-materials, less expensive and large-scale depolymerization is enabled with a low catalyst loading at higher temperature.

The readily polymerizable isolated monomers confirmed the feasibility of the proposed circular economy.","The study involves chemical recycling of glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET-G), a commercial plastic, through depolymerization under controlled conditions with measurable yields and catalyst performance, indicating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"Applications of H2-Enriched syngas and slag products from plastic wastes via novel plasma dual-stage-arc pyrolysis Sustainable plastic waste management in the prevailing ‘new-normal’ post-pandemic scenario calls for calorific waste plastic up-cycling into high-end product recovery pathways. The present work employed a novel dual-stage arc plasma pyrolysis reactor to recover syngas and slag products from mixed plastics and Low-Density Polyethylene and Polyethylene Terephthalate (LDPE-PET) plastic waste feeds. Syngas product yield decreased while the solid slag yield increased with rising arc current, attaining 75% and 25% for mixed plastic waste feed and 59% and 41% for LDPE-PET wastes, respectively, at 200A arc current. The resultant syngas composition showed 83% and 77% H2 while 1.7% and 2.7% CO for mixed plastic waste-feed and LDPE-PET wastes, respectively, with no significant presence of CO2. Slag characterization studies revealed the presence of scattered pores on the slag surface, graphitic nanostructures due to scraped carbon depositions from electrode tips and the absence of aromatic groups due to complete conversion. High carbon content was observed in the slag due to the dissociation of lighter hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide on dual-arc exposure in two stages, underscoring the higher efficiency. For holistic integrated circular onsite ‘plastic waste-to-resource’ recovery-cum-application, electricity was generated from the resultant syngas and the slag was used for the manufacture of tiles in the community platform. Techno-economic evaluation of an up-scaled plasma pyrolysis facility shows the power recovery of 3.5 kWh/kg of waste plastic, with a net annual profit of $2800 and a payback period of 1.7 years. The findings of the present work suggest that the proposed integrated dual-arc plasma pyrolysis based plastic waste-to-resource recovery in circular-economy model has a viable outcome.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste and LDPE-PET using a dual-stage arc plasma reactor, with measurable product yields, syngas composition, slag characterization, and reactor condition data."
"Analytical and experimental study of switchgrass and agricultural plastic co-pyrolysis in a microwave reactor This work describes initial results from microwave co-pyrolysis of switchgrass and agricultural plastic waste in the form of polyethylene (PE) hay bale covers. Analytical pyrolysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to better understand the volatile composition and thermal decomposition behavior during co-pyrolysis. Experimental microwave pyrolysis was carried out in a 1.2 kW multimode microwave cavity to pyrolyze 100 g of feedstock mixed with activated carbon absorber at different temperatures (350, 400, 500, 550, and 600 °C) and the product compositions were analyzed. The liquid and wax product compositions were found to have an additive effect, where switchgrass mainly contributed to the liquid fraction and PE mainly contributed to the hydrocarbon fraction. The greatest recovery of condensable organics was obtained at 400 °C with a greater proportion of organic liquids and 600 °C with a greater proportion of waxes. Further, the waxy fraction was converted into pitch to investigate a potential high value application for this fraction that is difficult to thermally decompose.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of waste plastic (PE) and biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Gaseous products from primary reactions of fast plastic pyrolysis This study aimed to establish primary reactions and identify gaseous products during fast pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). Fast pyrolysis was performed by using Py-GC/MS/FID at 574 ± 22 °C for 5 s. Gaseous fractions formed during pyrolysis of LDPE, PP and PS were 14 ± 1 wt%, 31 ± 3 wt% and 103 ± 12 wt%, respectively. The main gaseous compounds from LDPE were butane, 1-pentane and 1-hexene. PP pyrolysis gave propene, pentane and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene as the main gaseous compounds. Styrene monomer was the dominant gas from PS. The results showed that polyolefin (PP and PE) produced aliphatic hydrocarbons, while PS formed aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism suggests that both inter- and intra-molecular hydrogen transfer occur during PP and PE pyrolysis. PS pyrolysis involves a C-C cleavage at the aliphatic side chain. This work is important to understand the mechanism of gas formation of primary reactions from pyrolysis of common plastics.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, PP, PS) with measurable gaseous product yields, identified compounds, and reactor conditions."
"Thermal degradation of waste plastics under non-sweeping atmosphere: Part 1: Effect of temperature, product optimization, and degradation mechanism Continuous generation of plastic waste has prompted substantial research efforts in its utilization as a feedstock for energy generation. Pyrolysis has emerged as one of the best waste management technique for energy extraction from the plastic waste. The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of operating temperature on the liquid product yields in the pyrolysis process by non-isothermal heating. Non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) [high density polyethylene (HDPE)], waste polypropene (PP), waste polystyrene (PS), waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and mixed plastic waste (MPW) was carried out in a non-sweeping atmosphere in a semi-batch reactor at four different temperatures 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C. The minimum degradation temperature of the mixed and individual plastics was obtained using a thermogravimetric apparatus (TGA) at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The TGA results show that all plastics degrade in a single step and the degradation temperatures of PS > PET > PP > HDPE, while mixed plastic degradation indicates two distinct degradation steps. Further, a waste polymer shows a lower degradation temperature than the virgin polymer. The degradation of HDPE is found to produce the maximum oil yield with minimum solid residue. The degradation of PET results in the highest amount of solid and benzoic acid as crystals and gas with no oil. Degradation of mixed plastic causes oil yield in the intermediate range of pyrolysis of individual plastic wastes. Overall, 500 °C is observed to be an optimum temperature for the recovery of low-density pyrolytic oil with the highest liquid yield. The degradation of PE and PP is found to be caused by random chain scission followed by inter and intramolecular hydrogen transfer. The degradation of PS occurs by side elimination or end chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The degradation of mix plastics results from random chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The effect of temperature on oil and gas recovery as well as recovery time was also assessed.","The study involves non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PS, PET, and mixed plastic waste) in a semi-batch reactor with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of degradation mechanisms."
"Catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste battery separators with limited removal of the Al2O3 layer for selective aromatic hydrocarbons production over HZSM-5 catalyst Waste battery separators typically feature a ""sandwich"" structure made of plastic substrates and Al2O3 layers, which are stable and difficult to degrade or recycle. To address this, a novel method was developed for the directional degradation and high-value conversion of waste plastics, combining alkaline pretreatment with catalytic pyrolysis, promoting the efficient and valuable recycling of waste battery separators. Specifically, alkaline washing was applied for the pretreatment of the Al2O3-layered separators to control the limited removal of the Al2O3 layer. Aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) were subsequently produced by pyrolysis using a HZSM-5 catalyst. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for the systematical evaluation of the effects of pretreatment and pyrolysis conditions on AHs production. The findings demonstrated the limited removal of the compact Al2O3 layer through alkaline pretreatment enhanced the synergistic catalytic effect of Al2O3 and HZSM-5. This not only promoted the release of volatile components and their decomposition into more light olefins catalyzed by Al2O3, but also enhanced the subsequent conversion of light olefins into AHs catalyzed by HZSM-5. Optimal conditions included a 0.050 mol/L NaOH concentration, a 650°C-pyrolysis temperature and a catalyst/sample ratio of 12, achieving an AHs yield of 89.89 wt% (on dry ash-free basis). This yield was considerably higher than the 60.40 wt% achieved from untreated separators and the 65.61 wt% from pure polyethylene separators. This study laid a solid foundation for the efficient and high-value recycling of waste battery separators.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste battery separators containing plastic substrates, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of aromatic hydrocarbons."
"Effect of catalyst contact mode and gas atmosphere during catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics In the present study, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were pyrolyzed using HZSM-5 zeolite in a tandem micro-pyrolyzer to investigate the effects of plastic type, catalyst and feedstock contact mode, as well as the type of carrier gas on product distribution. Among the four plastics, PS produced highest aromatic yields up to 85% whereas PE and PP mainly produced aliphatic hydrocarbons. In comparison to ex-situ pyrolysis, in-situ pyrolysis of the plastics produced more solid residue but also promoted the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons, except PS. For PS, ex-situ pyrolysis produced a higher yield of aromatics than in-situ pyrolysis, mostly contributed by high styrene yield. During in-situ pyrolysis, the catalyst reduced the decomposition temperatures of the plastics in the order of PE, PP, PS and PET from high to low. Hydrogen carrier gas reduced solid residue and also increased the selectivity of single ring aromatics in comparison to inert pyrolysis. Hydrogen was more beneficial to PS and PET than PE and PP in terms of reducing coke yield and increasing hydrocarbon yield. The present study also showed that catalytically co-pyrolyzing PS and PE, or PET and PE increases the yield of aromatics and reduces the yield of solid residue due to hydrogen transfer from PE to PS or PET and alkylation reactions among the plastic-derivatives.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization under varying reactor conditions and gas atmospheres."
"Insight into the joint valorization of CO2 and waste plastics by pyrolysis and in line dry reforming for syngas production This paper assesses the potential of plastics valorization by pyrolysis and in line catalytic dry reforming for syngas production. Previous studies showed the suitability of a continuous process made up of a conical spouted bed reactor for fast pyrolysis and a fluidized bed reactor for catalytic steam reforming. In order to step further in the application of this technology under dry reforming conditions, equilibrium simulation was approached to analyze process performance, as the development and optimization of this technology for the production of high-quality syngas requires understanding in detail the complex influence of process parameters. Thus, this study deals with the influence of main process parameters, namely, temperature, CO2/C ratio and the type of plastic, on the process performance. Furthermore, the role played by steam co-feeding in the dry reforming in order to adjust syngas H2/CO ratio was evaluated by varying the steam/carbon ratio. The obtained results clearly show that a strict control of process conditions is required to ensure high conversion to syngas and avoid undesired reactions, such as reverse WGS. Among the plastics studied, polyolefins are those of highest potential for syngas production, but polystyrene allows producing a high quality syngas through a combined reforming strategy.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (polyolefins, polystyrene) in a conical spouted bed reactor, with measurable process parameters and product analysis for syngas production."
"Catalytic conversion of waste plastics for recovery of high-quality gasoline range hydrocarbons over nano Cu/CuO/Cu2O @Y zeolite Catalytic pyrolysis of municipal polymer waste can serve as a practical and beneficial solution to prevent the burial of plastic waste in landfills by converting them into gasoline. In this study, the key properties of gasoline, including density, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, flash point, octane number, and aniline point, were determined and compared with the standards set for gasoline. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of the produced fuel, silica-alumina in amorphous and semi-crystalline states, and zeolite Y, were used as catalysts. Additionally, a mixture of copper metal and its one and two valence oxides obtained from an organic metal framework was deposited onto a support. Ultimately, the operational temperature of the fixed-bed catalytic reactor increased from 400 to 500 °C, and for each temperature, all properties of the produced gasoline were measured and compared with standard values to determine which catalyst and at what temperature can produce gasoline capable of meeting transportation industry standards and replacing petroleum-derived gasoline. The maximum octane number for gasoline produced using a fully crystalline catalyst was measured to be 97, indicating its high quality as the most critical factor in determining gasoline quality.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of municipal polymer waste in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent gasoline properties, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Synergistic co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride and corn stalk for improved products and dechlorination behavior Efficient strategies for the environmentally safe utilization of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are crucial to minimizing its environmental impact. This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of PVC and corn stalk in an infrared heating reactor to enhance product quality and mitigate hydrochloric acid (HCl) formation. The process exhibited significant synergy, improving oil yield and chlorine retention in char. At 700 °C with 25 % PVC, oil yield increased by 12.66 %, while GC-MS analysis revealed a 17.51 % rise in aromatic compounds, accompanied by reductions of 29.30 % in aliphatic compounds, 10.43 % in nitrogen-containing compounds, and 2.17 % in chlorine-containing compounds. Co-pyrolysis promoted the cyclization of olefins from corn stalk, enhancing aromatic production. Chlorine distribution analysis showed that up to 72 % of chlorine was retained in the char at 500 °C, while HCl emissions were significantly reduced by 84 % at 700 °C. XPS and XRD results confirmed that K2O in corn stalk reacted with HCl to form KCl, effectively trapping chlorine in the char. These findings demonstrate that co-pyrolysis offers a promising approach for sustainable PVC recycling with reduced HCl emissions and enhanced oil quality.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) combined with biomass (corn stalk), with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and reactor conditions reported."
"A strategy for industrial waste mitigation—thermal treatment of non-woven polyester fabric debris on ultrahigh-porosity MgO under CO2 atmosphere Unproperly treated industrial waste creates serious environmental pollution that requires immediate remediation strategies. Non-woven polyester fabrics are widely used in a variety of industrial applications; thus, their debris becomes a major portion of industrial waste. To contribute to advanced industrial waste treatment processes, this study investigated catalytic thermal treatment of non-woven polyester fabric debris on a novel ultrahigh-porosity MgO material under a CO2 environment. The ultrahigh-porosity MgO was synthesized from hydromagnesite via a series of thermal reactions, having a surface area of 208.8 m2 g−1, total pore volume of 0.34 cm3 g−1, and average pore diameter of 2.37 nm. Using the MgO as the catalyst for thermolysis of non-woven polyester fabric debris in CO2 promoted thermal cracking of volatilized species evolved from the non-woven polyester fabric debris thermolysis, thereby increasing the gas product yield and decreasing the liquid product and wax yields. In addition, dehydrogenation and reverse water gas reaction was promoted by the MgO catalyst, leading to more than higher syngas production (up to 16.1 wt% syngas yield) compared to non-catalytic thermolysis (up to 8 wt% syngas yield). The selectivity toward esters was increased, while the selectivities toward benzoic and phthalic acids were decreased, most likely due to the MgO promoting decarboxylation and esterification reactions during the thermolysis. Moreover, the ultrahigh-porosity MgO catalyst was reusable for at least two consecutive cycles. It is hoped that the applicability of the novel material as a catalyst is widened for advanced treatment processes to minimize negative effects of industrial wastes on the environment.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of non-woven polyester fabric debris, a waste plastic, using a novel MgO catalyst under CO2 atmosphere, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Upcycling of EVA resin from photovoltaics into supercapacitor material and combustible gas by autogenic pressure pyrolysis In response to the growing challenge of photovoltaic waste management, developing sustainable and value-added treatment strategies is imperative. In this study, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) resins sourced from waste photovoltaic modules and virgin materials were utilized for the production of hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) and methane-rich combustible gas via autogenic pressure pyrolysis coupled with KOH activation. Temperature-dependent pyrolysis revealed that 700 °C was the optimal condition, yielding pyrolysis gas with a high methane content (43.39 vol%) and producing graphitized carbon spheres. Subsequent KOH activation generated HPC with a large specific surface area of 765.4 m2/g. When applied as a supercapacitor electrode in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte, the HPC exhibited a high specific capacitance of 152 F/g at 0.2 A/g. Additionally, EVA resins with higher vinyl acetate content and melt index (MI) produced greater amounts of methane and pyrolytic carbon, while the resins with lower MI values showed enhanced reactivity toward chemical activation. This work offers a green and efficient route for the high-value recycling of EVA in PV waste and contributes to the sustainable synthesis of advanced HPC materials for energy storage applications.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste EVA resin (a commercial plastic) under controlled conditions, with measurable yields of methane-rich gas and graphitized carbon, and provides detailed product characterization and performance data."
"Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste LDPE: Unveiling the role of induced gas-solid thermal gradients on pyrolysis oil product distribution Microwave-assisted heating plays an important role in minimizing the high energy consumption of traditional thermochemical recycling processes. Its application to plastic waste recycling routes enables a more efficient production of new renewable feedstocks for the petrochemical industry. This work presents the experimental assessment of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste recycling in a microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) fixed bed reactor and the in-depth evaluation of the obtained pyrolysis oils in comparison with conventional plastic waste pyrolysis oils. The role of main process variables (temperature, nitrogen flow rate and susceptor-to-LDPE ratio) on the pyrolysis oil yield and composition was addressed. The maximum attained oil and wax yields were of 60–75 wt%. As a general trend, the microwave-assisted process led to a distinct chemo-selectivity compared to that of traditional LDPE pyrolysis, shifting the products distribution from saturated paraffins to olefinic species and longer molecular chains. Olefins content rose from 28 % under conventional pyrolysis to 75 % under MAP. The negligible content of aromatic compounds in MAP oils offers great potential to serve as a recycled feedstock for steam crackers. These findings are ascribed to gas-phase reactions quenching due to the microwave-induced thermal gradient between the selectively heated bed and the comparatively colder surrounding atmosphere. A statistical parametric analysis and regression model have been implemented to further evaluate the impact of each variable, and mechanistic considerations were considered on the experimental microwave-induced thermal gradients and fixed bed mass and heat transfer properties. By integrating real polyolefin waste streams as feedstocks for chemical building blocks through microwave-assisted pyrolysis, this study helps paving the way for a transition to circularity in petrochemical industries.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste LDPE with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Synthesis of green fluorescent carbon quantum dots using waste polyolefins residue for Cu2+ ion sensing and live cell imaging The residue obtained from the pyrolysis of waste polyolefins, has been used for preparation of highly green-visual fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) by a simple one step hydrothermal approach consisting of ultrasonic-assisted chemical oxidation. These CQDs were characterized by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, and FTIR. The CQDs possessed high stability in aqueous solution and exhibited strong fluorescence with quantum yield of 4.84%. The use of these CQDs as a fluorescent sensor for Cu2+ ions detection has been explored. The synthesized CQDs have excellent selectivity and sensitivity towards Cu2+ ions with a limit of detection (LOD) 6.33nM and linear detection range of 1–8.0μM. These CQDs have also shown their utility for analysis of real water samples and have the potential to use for triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 468 cells) imaging.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste polyolefins, a commercial plastic, to produce residue used for synthesizing carbon quantum dots, with experimental characterization and measurable product yields."
"Classification of volatile products from the temperature-programmed pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), atactic-polypropylene (APP) and thermogravimetrically derived kinetics of pyrolysis A fixed bed reactor under argon flow was used to pyrolyse small samples of polypropylene (PP) and atactic polypropylene (APP). A special gas-phase sampling technique was used to determine the composition of products eluted from the reactor as a function of temperature and time. Capillary gas chromatography was used to determine the total volatile product evolution rate. The maximum volatile product evolution temperature was 420°C for APP and 425°C for PP. The recovery of carbon as an organic volatile product was determined and pyrolysis products were classified as a carbon number. The pyrolysis products were also identified with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Polypropylene (PP) and atactic polypropylene (APP) decomposed into a large number of aliphatic compounds without a residue. The variety of products was more complex than from polyethylene degradation. Due to the branched structure of PP and APP, also branched isomers are formed. 96 wt.% of carbon in PP and 97 wt.% of carbon in APP was converted to volatile organic compounds such as dienes, alkanes, and alkenes. Major compounds are for instance C9 compounds, like 2-methyl-4-octene, 2-methyl-2-octene, 2,6-dimethyl -2,4-heptadiene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene, 2-methyl-1-octene. The thermal degradation of both PP and APP were investigated under non-isothermal conditions. The weight loss data have been analyzed by Flynn and Wall methods. The activation energies for overall degradation of PP and APP were determined.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) and atactic-polypropylene (APP) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent volatile evolution, GC/MS analysis of products, and kinetic parameters derived from experimental data."
"Deactivation and regeneration of a Ni supported hierarchical Beta zeolite catalyst used in the hydroreforming of the oil produced by LDPE thermal cracking The deactivation and regeneration of Ni supported over hierarchical Beta zeolite catalyst was investigated. Ni/h-Beta was deactivated by coke deposition during the hydroreforming of the product from LDPE thermal cracking, being this coke mostly located inside the micropores (71% coverage). Its regeneration by calcination in stagnant air at 550°C followed by reduction under H2 up to 550°C removed largely the coke and retrieved its activity. During the cycle of reaction–regeneration, the nickel particles fractured and moved out to the external surface forming larger size polynanocrystalline aggregates. NH3 TPD proved that the total acidity of the catalyst increased slightly after the regeneration treatment. No collapse of the structure of the Beta structure was appreciated although some changes of the textural properties of the catalyst were observed after the regeneration treatment. The hydroreforming tests pointed out that, after the regeneration, the hydrocracking augmented originating lighter products (gases and gasolines), due to the stronger acidity. The olefins were largely hydrogenated (>90%) while the amount of aromatics and isoparaffins decreased, likely because of the worse hydrogen transfer provoked by nickel sintering or to steric hindrances caused by the lower pore volumes detected. The main changes were observed after the first cycle, so a rather stable catalyst was obtained afterwards.","The study involves pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) followed by hydroreforming of the resulting oil, with measurable experimental data on catalyst deactivation, regeneration, product yields, and catalytic performance."
"Comparison between emissions from the pyrolysis and combustion of different wastes A comparison between different emission rates of various pollutants obtained from various wastes is presented. The studied wastes were the following: polyethylene (PE), tyres, sewage sludges, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cotton textiles, polyester textiles, meat and bone meals (MBMs), varnish wastes, olive oil solid waste (pomace), waste lube oils and paper waste. The decomposition of these wastes was studied in a horizontal laboratory scale reactor under fuel-rich conditions, and the analysis of the pollutants evolved comprised several compounds such as light hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). From the studied wastes, a general behaviour was deduced regarding the evolution of semi-volatile compounds with the increase of temperature, both in pyrolysis and combustion. The results showed that the emissions of some compounds decreased with increasing oxygen ratio. Compounds with this behaviour were mainly volatile hydrocarbons, which were consumed in presence of oxygen. In addition, compounds with oxidized structure were present a maximum with oxygen ratio. Intermediate compounds with very high resistance to the oxygen under the working conditions increased continuously in concentration when the oxygen ratio increased. With reference to behaviour versus temperature there were compounds whose yields decreased with increasing temperature, such as volatile hydrocarbons and semi-volatile compounds. Also some pollutants are promoted at intermediate temperatures, e.g. light hydrocarbons, semi-volatile compounds, many monoaromatic compounds and many polyaromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PVC) and other plastic-containing wastes in a horizontal reactor, with measured emissions and pollutant yields analyzed at varying temperatures and oxygen ratios."
"Influence of particle characteristics, heating temperature and time on the pyrolysis product distributions of polystyrene micro- and nano-plastics Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) has been widely used for the detection of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in the environment. However, there is a lack of thorough investigation on the effects of pyrolysis temperature and time, as well as the particle source, size and mass of MNPs on the pyrolysis efficiency and pyrolysis product distribution of MNPs. Herein, taking the common plastics polystyrene (PS) as a model, we systematically evaluated the influences of the above factors on the pyrolysis of PS MNPs. Results showed that pyrolysis temperature and time significantly affect the pyrolysis efficiency. By measuring the relative response values of the indicator compound styrene trimers to styrene monomer, the optimum condition was determined as the temperature of 510 ℃ and pyrolysis time longer than 18 s. Meanwhile, the mass of MNPs also affected the distribution of PS pyrolysis products. The proportions of styrene dimers and trimers increased slightly with PS MNP mass, while the source, particle size of MNPs have little effect on the pyrolysis product distribution. This work proposed a suitable pyrolysis temperature and time for the determination of PS by Py-GC/MS, which would contribute to the accurate analysis of PS MNPs in the environment.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polystyrene micro- and nano-plastics under varying temperatures, times, and particle characteristics, with measurable product distributions and optimized conditions determined via Py-GC/MS analysis."
"The co-pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene and polyolefins The co-pyrolysis of brominated high impact polystyrene (Br-HIPS) with polyolefins using a fixed bed reactor has been investigated, in particular, the effect that different types of brominated aryl compounds and antimony trioxide have on the pyrolysis products. The pyrolysis products were analysed using FT-IR, GC–FID, GC–MS, and GC–ECD. Liquid chromatography was used to separate the oils/waxes so that a more detailed analysis of the aliphatic, aromatic, and polar fractions could be carried out. It was found that interaction occurs between Br-HIPS and polyolefins during co-pyrolysis and that the presence of antimony trioxide influences the pyrolysis mass balance. Analysis of the Br-HIPS+polyolefin co-pyrolysis products showed that the presence of polyolefins led to an increase in the concentration of alkyl and vinyl mono-substituted benzene rings in the pyrolysis oil/wax resulting from Br-HIPS pyrolysis. The presence of Br-HIPS also had an impact on the oil/wax products of polyolefin pyrolysis, particularly on the polyethylene oil/wax composition which converted from being a mixture of 1-alkenes and n-alkanes to mostly n-alkanes. Antimony trioxide had very little impact on the polyolefin wax/oil composition but it did suppress the formation of styrene and alpha-methyl styrene and increase the formation of ethylbenzene and cumene during the pyrolysis of the Br-HIPS.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (Br-HIPS and polyolefins) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and detailed experimental data on product composition and catalyst effects."
"Recycling polyamide 6 fishing nets and carbon fibers for the development of novel sustainable composites: Properties and LCA process analysis Fishing nets and related gear account for approximately 20% of the total plastic waste in the ocean, amounting to around 640,000 tons per year. Efforts are underway to develop circular economy strategies for the reuse and recycling of marine plastics. In this context, the present study introduces an innovative approach for developing advanced composite materials, employing recycled polyamide 6 (rPA6) derived from fishing nets and reinforced with recycled carbon fibers (rCF) recovered from epoxy resins through a novel thermo-oxidative process. The process involves pyrolysis at 510 °C in nitrogen to degrade the epoxy matrix, followed by gasification in air to produce clean rCF with enhanced adhesion to rPA6, eliminating the need for new sizing. This treatment increases the presence of polar groups on the surface of rCF compared to virgin carbon fibers (vCF), improving the O/C ratio (from 0.021 to 0.054 wt%) while maintaining their dimensions (7–8 μm) and surface smoothness, resulting in similar mechanical properties (293 ± 20 versus 282 ± 35 GPa). The improved compatibility of rCF with rPA6, compared to vCF, is demonstrated by the enhanced tensile modulus (11.1 and 13.1 GPa) and impact toughness (25.9 and 28.4 kJ/m2) observed in vCF/rPA6 and rCF/rPA6 composites, respectively, at the highest fiber loading of 15 wt%, in contrast to pure rPA6 (3.2 GPa and 11.8 kJ/m2). A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the CF-polyamide 6 composites. Three production scenarios were compared: Scenario 0 (virgin PA6 and vCF), Scenario 1 (rPA6 and vCF), and Scenario 2 (rPA6 and rCF). Scenario 2 showed the highest reduction in emissions, saving 5.74E+03 kg of CO2 equivalents. While off-site wastewater treatment increased some emissions, the use of recycled materials consistently reduced the overall environmental impact, highlighting the benefits of sustainable waste recovery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of epoxy resin-bound carbon fibers at 510 °C in nitrogen to recover recycled carbon fibers, with measurable reactor conditions, product characterization, and yield-related data."
"Plasma catalytic hydrogenolysis of polyethylene to gasoline-range fuels over Sm/USY catalysts Plasma catalysis, as a highly promising technology for plastic upcycling, enables the efficient conversion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into oil fuels under mild conditions. For the plasma-catalytic LDPE hydrogenolysis process at an input power of ca. 56 W without external heating, the optimized 5Sm/USY catalyst exhibited the highest yield of oil fuels (83 %), with C4-C13 gasoline-range fractions accounting for up to 98 %. Compared to pure plasma condition, the incorporation of catalyst improved the discharge power and the discharge mode was transformed to surface discharge, which promoted the LDPE conversion. Notably, the plasma-catalytic system exhibited a 1.51-fold increase in C-C bond cleavage rate compared to thermal catalysis, with energy consumption being less than one-fifth of thermal catalytic processes, demonstrating its superior bond-breaking efficiency and energy-saving advantage. Mechanistic studies revealed that the plasma effectively activates LDPE molecular chains, synergizing with the shape-selective effect of porous USY zeolite. The addition of Sm2O3 species increased the content of Lewis acid sites and further promoted hydrogen ion abstraction to form carbocations. This method demonstrated excellent performance in converting other polyolefin wastes and real plastic wastes, particularly achieving 88 % liquid yield from real plastics, fully confirming the exceptional performance of the 5Sm/USY catalyst in plasma-assisted plastic waste conversion.","The study involves plasma catalytic hydrogenolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and experimental characterization."
"Experimental investigation of products from thermal treatment of real-world mixed single-use and multi-layered waste plastics The usage and disposal of highly abundant single-use and multilayered plastics contribute to significant ecological problems. The thermochemical recovery of these plastics to useful products and chemicals provides opportunity for positive economic and environmental impacts. Most previous research use idealised and unrepresentative feedstocks. To address this, various mixed waste plastics collected from the rejected fraction of a municipal waste recovery facility in Ghana were pyrolyzed at varying temperatures of 450, 500 and 550 °C and their yields compared. The obtained chemical products were analysed using several different techniques. Energy and carbon balances of the processes were produced using the CHNS and energy content of the oil fraction and the compositional results of the pyrolysis gas fraction, the latter of which was measured by Gas Chromatography Thermal Conductivity Detection (GC-TCD). The oils were further assessed via Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the available valuable compounds. The formed oil contained approximately 40% light hydrocarbons (C6 – C11), 18% middle hydrocarbons (C11 – C16) and 42% heavy hydrocarbon compounds (C16+). The optimal oil yield of 65.9 ± 0.5% and low heating value of 44.7 ± 0.1 MJ/kg for single-use plastics were recorded at highest heating temperatures of 550 and 500 °C, respectively. The findings provide indication that pyrolysis is a fitting solution for energy recovery from waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real-world mixed waste plastics with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions, including GC-MS and GC-TCD characterization."
"Comparative study on synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of tobacco stalk with polymer wastes: Thermal behavior, gas formation, and kinetics Co-pyrolysis of tobacco stalk (TS) with different types of polymer wastes such as scrap tire (ST), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was investigated. Thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was carried out to examine the thermochemical properties, kinetics, and gas generation. The results of the co-pyrolysis showed a synergistic effect compared to the pyrolysis of the individual components. When using TS/ST co-pyrolysis, the reduction in char residue was about 6% (dry wt. basis) and the increase in organic gases exceeded 20%. It indicates that the addition of ST can increase both carbon conversion efficiency and volatiles yield. HCl from PVC underwent a complex physicochemical reaction with TS, increasing coke yield by 11–12% and inhibiting the gas release. In the main pyrolysis temperature range of ST, the activation energy is reduced by 40–80% by blending with TS; for PP this value is reduced by about 22%.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PVC) and tobacco stalk in a thermogravimetric analyzer, with measurable product yields, kinetic data, and gas formation analysis."
"Microwave pyrolysis valorization of used baby diaper Used baby diaper consists of a combination of decomposable cellulose, non-biodegradable plastic materials (e.g. polyolefins) and super-absorbent polymer materials, thus making it difficult to be sorted and separated for recycling. Microwave pyrolysis was examined for its potential as an approach to transform used baby diapers into value-added products. Influence of the key operating parameters comprising process temperature and microwave power were investigated. The pyrolysis showed a rapid heating process (up to 43 °C/min of heating rate) and quick reaction time (20–40 min) in valorizing the used diapers to generate pyrolysis products comprising up to 43 wt% production of liquid oil, 29 wt% gases and 28 wt% char product. Microwave power and operating temperature were observed to have impacts on the heating rate, process time, production and characteristics of the liquid oil and solid char. The liquid oil contained alkanes, alkenes and esters that can potentially be used as chemical additives, cosmetic products and fuel. The solid char contained high carbon, low nitrogen and free of sulphur, thus showing potential for use as adsorbents and soil additives. These observations demonstrate that microwave pyrolysis has great prospect in transforming used baby diaper into liquid oil and char products that can be utilised in several applications.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of waste plastic-containing used baby diapers, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of oil and char."
"Influence of pyrolysis temperature on carbon deposition from the perspective of volatile evolution during the ex-situ pyrolysis-catalysis of plastic To better understand the mechanism of carbon deposition, the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) was explored over a FeNi/Al2O3 catalyst, and the evolution of volatiles as well as the yield and structure of carbon products at different temperatures were analyzed in depth by an in-situ atmospheric pressure photoionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (APPI HRMS) combined with a fixed-bed reactor. The results show that raising the pyrolysis temperature (from 500 to 800 °C) reduces carbon product yield and H2 production, and the proportion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the carbon products decreases. The source of carbon products gradually shifts from liquid-phase carbon sources to gaseous-phase carbon sources. Below 700 °C, both the outer diameter and carbon interlayer spacing of CNTs decrease, while above 700 °C, they both increase along with increased distortion of carbon layers. It is also observed that the carbon layers are connected to the catalyst lattice stripes, and the interlayer spacing of carbon layers is greater than the catalyst lattice spacing. In situ mass spectrometry reveals a significant increase in the carbon number and double bond equivalent (DBE) values of volatiles with increasing pyrolysis temperature, but the rate of increase slows down after 700 °C. Volatiles from lower pyrolysis temperatures undergo severe polymerization, upon entering the catalytic zone at higher temperatures, minimizing temperature-induced distinctions. Nevertheless, it remains evident that volatiles from lower pyrolysis temperatures exhibit less pronounced polymerization when exposed to higher catalytic temperatures.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on polyethylene pyrolysis with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent carbon deposition, and detailed analytical characterization of volatiles and carbon products."
"Conversion of lignin with polystyrene into high-value aromatics through co-pyrolysis and post-plasma refining Lignin was co-pyrolyzed with polystyrene to subject volatiles to post-plasma refining for potential aromatic production, mainly focusing on effects of blend ratio and plasma parameters. Firstly, the co-pyrolysis at equal mass ratio was beneficial for reducing residual char and reaction energy barrier. Secondly, elevating polystyrene blend ratio could improve oil yield, fuel-grade, and aromatic selectivity, but the improvement was compromised, showing volatiles synergy and plasma excitation were more favorable at a balanced ratio, because the H-donation of polystyrene and the bond-cleavage ability of lignin-derived oxyradicals were fully utilized. Thirdly, increasing plasma current enhanced plasma emission spectra, meaning more energetic reactive species, while extending discharge length had a little effect on the spectra, but doubling the discharge length had a more obvious refining effect than increasing the discharge current by equal steps. Fourthly, increased plasma parameters contributed to the breakage of bridged bonds between benzene rings and the loss of aliphatic side-chains, deepening deoxygenation, lowing molecular weight, and raising aromatic proton ratio. However, higher plasma current mainly weakened the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics, and higher discharge length severely decreased the aromatic yield. Therefore, this study suggested the possibility of using non-catalytic methods to recover high-value aromatics from lignin and polystyrene.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) with lignin, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of aromatic selectivity and refining effects."
"Resource recovery via catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene using zeolites This study focuses on selective production of valuable chemicals from polystyrene (PS) via catalytic fast pyrolysis using micropyrolyzer–GC/MS set-up. Catalytic fast pyrolysis of PS was performed using eight different zeolites belonging to ZSM-5, zeolite-β, and zeolite-Y families. The catalysts were characterized for the strength of Brønsted acid sites and pore size distribution. The composition of PS:catalyst was optimized at 1:2.3±0.2wt./wt. to enhance the yield of benzene, at the same time reduce the yield of condensed ring fragments like indene and indane derivatives. The yields of various products correlated well with specific properties of zeolites like relative strength of Brønsted acid sites, specific surface area, and pore volume. Importantly, the yield of benzene increased, while that of styrene, α-methyl styrene, and dimers decreased with Brønsted acidity. Zeolite-β hydrogen and zeolite-Y ammonia catalysts resulted in the formation of up to 50wt.% of benzene. High temperatures led to a reduction in benzene yield and promoted the formation of styrene, α-methyl styrene, and ethyl benzene. The observed product distribution with different zeolites and at different temperatures was corroborated using the relative importance of the primary protonation pathways involved in catalytic fast pyrolysis of PS.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) using zeolites, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of coffee-grounds and waste polystyrene foam by calcium oxide in bubbling fluidized bed reactor The high concentration of oxygenated components in biomass pyrolysis oil challenges the conversion of biomass to bio-fuels via fast pyrolysis. Herein, calcium oxide was prepared to convert the oxygenated compounds in the pyrolytic products of coffee-grounds to valuable hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, waste polystyrene foam was co-pyrolyzed with coffee-grounds to promote hydrogen transfer reactions, resulting from scission of the polystyrene radicals. The results show that calcium oxide could effectively reduce the concentration of undesired oxygenated compounds like phenols and fatty acids in pyrolytic products. The effects of calcium oxide and polystyrene were mainly reflected in the production of a deoxygenated organic fraction, rich in aromatics and with a considerable calorific value. An organic fraction with an oxygen content of 13.38 wt% was obtained at a catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 1:8 and an amount of polystyrene foam of 20 wt%. This fraction, due to its properties and its compositions, is considered for use as potential feedstock in the energy market.

"Determination of activation energy of pyrolysis of carton packaging wastes and its pure components using thermogravimetry Many processes have been used for recycling of carton packaging wastes. The pyrolysis highlights as a promising technology to be used for recovering the aluminum from polyethylene and generating products with high heating value. In this paper, a study on pyrolysis reactions of carton packaging wastes and its pure components was performed in order to estimate the kinetic parameters of these reactions. For this, dynamic thermogravimetric analyses were carried out and two different kinds of kinetic models were used: the isoconversional and Independent Parallel Reactions. Isoconversional models allowed to calculate the overall activation energy of the pyrolysis reaction, in according to their conversions. The IPR model, in turn, allowed the calculation of kinetic parameters of each one of the carton packaging and paperboard subcomponents. The carton packaging pyrolysis follows three separated stages of devolatilization. The first step is moisture loss. The second stage is perfectly correlated to devolatilization of cardboard. The third step is correlated to devolatilization of polyethylene.","The study involves lab-scale thermogravimetric analysis of carton packaging waste, a mixture of plastic (polyethylene) and paper, to determine pyrolysis kinetics and activation energy, with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships."
"A study on the characteristics and kinetic of co-catalytic pyrolysis with rape straw and ABS waste plastics TG analysis, kinetic model and fixed-bed experiments were applied in this study to explore the synergistic effect of rape straw (RS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) in the co-catalytic pyrolysis. The results showed that the preferential pyrolysis of RS was favorable for the formation of some active radicals and decreased the pyrolysis temperature of ABS from about 400 °C to 350 °C. As the mixing ratio of ABS rose, the temperature range of co-pyrolysis decreased gradually. The interaction between the free radicals generated by RS and ABS was effectively promoted with the addition of HZSM-5, and also the aromatization was accelerated. The temperature range of co-pyrolysis was decreased from 350 °C to 400 °C–340 °C–380 °C. The Flynn-Wall Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) were used to build the kinetics model, and revealed that the activation energy of co-pyrolysis system reached the bottom with the mixing ratio was 1:1, indicating the strongest synergistic effect at this point. The synergistic action was revealed from the kinetic analysis. In the fixed-bed test, the yield of liquid phase (54.15 %) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) (32.87 %) peaked at the mixing ratio of 1:1, at which the synergistic effect inhibited the conversion to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of ABS waste plastic with rape straw, reports measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance with analytical data."
"Selective recovery of caprolactam from the thermo-catalytic conversion of textile waste over γ-Al2O3 supported metal catalysts The massive generation of synthetic textile waste has drawn considerable attention. Landfilling/incineration of textile waste has been widely made. To abate the environmental burdensome from the conventional management processes, a thermo-catalytic conversion was used for rapid volume reduction of textile waste and simultaneous valorization by recovering textile monomer in this study. Stockings were chosen as a model feedstock. Because stockings consisted of nylon with other contents, different products (caprolactam (nylon monomer), imines, cyclic dimers, and azepines) were recovered. The yield of caprolactam from the thermal conversion at 500 °C was 53.6 wt%. To selectively enhance the caprolactam yield, catalytic pyrolysis was done using γ-Al2O3 supported metal catalysts (Ni, Cu, Fe, or Co). γ-Al2O3 itself increased the caprolactam yield up to 69.0 wt% via a based-catalyzed reaction of nylon depolymerization and intramolecular cyclization. Under the presence of metal catalysts, the caprolactam yield increased up to 73.3 wt%. To offer desired feature of green chemistry, CO2 was adopted as reactive gas. Under the CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis, caprolactam yield was enhanced up to 77.1 wt% over Cu/Al2O3 (basis: stocking mass). Based on the net content of nylon in the stockings, the yield of caprolactam was deemed 95.3 wt%. This study proves that textile waste (stocking) and CO2 are useful resources for recovery of nylon monomer, which can reduce the waste generation with simultaneous recovery of value-added product.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of nylon-containing textile waste, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, reactor conditions, and product composition analysis."
"Microwave assisted pyrolysis of halogenated plastics recovered from waste computers Microwave Assisted Pyrolysis (MAP) of the plastic fraction of Waste from Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) from end-life computers was run with different absorbers and set-ups in a multimode batch reactor. A large amount of various different liquid fractions (up to 76.6wt%) were formed together with a remarkable reduction of the solid residue (up to 14.2wt%). The liquid fractions were characterized using the following different techniques: FT-IR ATR, 1H NMR and a quantitative GC–MS analysis. The liquid fractions showed low density and viscosity, together with a high concentration of useful chemicals such as styrene (up to 117.7mg/mL), xylenes (up to 25.6mg/mL for p-xylene) whereas halogenated compounds were absent or present in a very low amounts.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of halogenated plastics from WEEE, with measurable yields, product characterization via GC–MS, FT-IR, and NMR, and explicit quantification of valuable chemicals."
"Investigation of EPET, EPEI, and EPU pyrolysis characteristics: Thermal decomposition behaviours, pyrolysis products and mechanism Pyrolysis is a promising technology in recycling copper from enamelled wires. Nevertheless, due to the unclear pyrolysis characteristics, the sorting of enamelled wires is deficient in the pyrolysis process. This work systematically investigated the pyrolysis characteristics of polyester enamelled wire (EPET), polyester imine enamelled wire (EPEI) and polyurethane enamelled wire (EPU). The decomposition behaviours showed that the mass loss for EPEI and EPET was around 1.9%, while it was about 1.5% for EPU. The pyrolysis temperature intervals and peaks for both EPEI and EPET appeared in the range of 320 ∼ 500 ℃ and around 420 ℃, while it was in a larger range of 228 ∼ 657 ℃ for EPU, and the peak was about 280 ℃. The average activation energies (E) calculated with Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) model demonstrated that EPEI and EPET were respectively 275.8 kJ/mol and 296.9 kJ/mol, while it was 194.2 kJ/mol for EPU. TG-FTIR results proved that the -CH, -CO, -CH2, and -OH were the main functional groups in the pyrolysis process for the three enamelled wires. Moreover, Py-GC/MS results indicated that the main pyrolysis product was benzoic acid for EPET and EPEI, while it was not observed for EPU. The pyrolysis mechanism displayed that the kinds of pyrolysis products were directly related to the connected aromatic functional group. The complicated pyrolysis products for EPU were mainly caused by the generation of isocyanate. Accordingly, EPU could be separately pyrolyzed, while EPET and EPEI were suitable for co-pyrolyzed. In consideration of improving pyrolysis efficiency and reducing energy consumption, the classification treatment by this method could be extended.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of waste plastic-based enamelled wires (EPET, EPEI, EPU) using experimental methods including TG-FTIR, Py-GC/MS, and activation energy calculations, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"A novel method for industrial production of clean hydrogen (H2) from mixed plastic waste This study describes a novel Hybrid Microwave Plasma Enhanced Gasification (HMPEG) method for converting plastic waste into hydrogen (H2). Thermal processing of plastic waste is a low-cost method of producing H2. Current methods, however, such as pyrolysis and gasification, are limited by inefficient heating and contaminants in syngas, resulting in a low H2 yield. Our approach consists of a novel rotary pyrolysis reactor that employs an external microwave heater and an electrodeless microwave torch reformer, thereby addressing issues with current methods. In this study, pyrolysis of mixed plastic produces pyro-gas which is reformed at a temperature above 1500 °C by the steam plasma torch powered by microwave. The result is a 150 g/kg H2 yield with a 67 vol.% higher production rate, an H2/CO ratio of 7, and a conversion efficiency of 97.4%. Tar and dioxin concentrations in the syngas were found to be 0.078 g/Nm3 and 0.024 ng-TEQ/Nm3, respectively, much less than the legal limit. A novel microwave pyrolyzer cuts electrical power consumption by half, and the pure H2 produced is suitable for direct use in hydrogen cars, power generation, and other applications. Once implemented, the energy-efficient HMPEG could aid in expanding H2 commercial plants that use plastic waste as a raw input fuel.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste using a novel rotary pyrolysis reactor with microwave heating, reporting measurable yields, product composition, and reactor conditions."
"Robust downstream technologies in polystyrene waste pyrolysis: Design and prospective life-cycle assessment of pyrolysis oil reintegration pathways Chemical recycling of polystyrene waste to virgin styrene by fluidized bed pyrolysis and purification of pyrolysis oil in a distillation sequence is investigated. It is shown experimentally that pre-treatment of expanded polystyrene (EPS) waste by hot washing does not improve styrene yields and thus styrene content in the pyrolysis oil, suggesting that no elaborate waste pre-treatment is necessary for polystyrene chemical recycling. Based on experimental results, pyrolysis oils with styrene content from 30 wt.-% to 80 wt.-% are considered in an Aspen Plus® downstream simulation. Process robustness is evaluated in terms of operating parameter sensitivity such as reflux and distillate-to-feed ratio. It is shown that for the purification of highly variable feed compositions trade-offs such as more columns or higher RR must be made. Prospective LCA reveals that chemical recycling is preferable to incineration of polystyrene waste, although to varying degrees depending on critical impurities present in the pyrolysis oil.","The study involves experimental pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a fluidized bed reactor with measured product yields and composition, including styrene content in pyrolysis oil."
"Upcycling of epoxy resin from waste wind turbine blades: Pyrolysis-methylation tandem reaction to methylated phenols and hexamethylbenzene The pyrolysis products of epoxy resin consist of mixed phenolic compounds, which can be transformed into methylated phenolic compounds, pentamethylbenzene, hexamethylbenzene, and other high-value chemicals through methylation. However, the mechanism of methylation for pyrolysis products of epoxy resin remains unclear. In this study, using thermosetting epoxy resin and waste wind turbine blades as feedstocks, we investigated the methylation performance of different solid acid catalysts (γ-Al2O3, α-Al2O3, ZSM-5, MCM-41) through a pyrolysis-methylation cascade reactor. The study unveils the impact of reaction temperature and reaction time on the pyrolysis reaction and the product distribution. The optimal reaction parameters are determined to be 500 °C and a reaction time of 20 min. Under these conditions, the reforming products exhibited the highest selectivity for methylated phenolic compounds and hexamethylbenzene (42.57 wt%). The proposed methyl substitution reaction pathway for isopropenylphenol was supported by a13C methanol isotope experiment. On nanoscale γ-Al2O3 catalyst, the methylation reaction displays a non-position-selective methylation pattern. Methyl substitution occurs by directly replacing the methylating agent on the isopropyl/isopropenyl group, leading to the breaking of the Carom-Caliph bond. Additionally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations reveal that methyl serves as an intermediate in the methylation substitution reaction. The study also conducted a material flow assessment for the recycling of epoxy resin waste through the pyrolysis-methylation pathway.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste wind turbine blades (epoxy resin, a thermosetting plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under defined reaction conditions."
"Co-cracking of jatropha oil, vacuum residue and HDPE and characterization of liquid, gaseous and char products obtained Co-processing of jatropha oil (JO), vacuum residue (VR) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were investigated to determine the behavior of the individual and blended mixture under atmospheric pressure and thermal heating conditions. A fixed bed tubular batch reactor was used for the experimental study under nitrogen atmosphere with a nitrogen flow of 120ml/h. Higher conversion of the reactant mixture was observed with the formation of liquid, gases and residual char. The co-cracking/co-processing of the JO, VR and HDPE showed synergism in their co-cracking reaction. The liquid products obtained from the co-cracking of JO, VR and HDPE were mostly aliphatic in nature. The cracked liquid obtained from the co-cracking reactions showed the presence of mainly diesel range hydrocarbons, though cracked liquid of VR+HDPE and JO+VR+HDPE showed the presence of about 22% gasoline range hydrocarbons. The gaseous products obtained consisted of methane, n-pentane, n-butane, iso-butane, 2-methyl butane and certain uncondensed components. The chars obtained indicated the presence of metals such as Ni, Fe, V, Mg and K. The overall results indicate the existence of interactive reactions between the reactive moieties generated, when JO, VR and HDPE were co-cracked together.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of HDPE, jatropha oil, and vacuum residue in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields and detailed characterization of liquid, gas, and char products."
"Influence of time and temperature on pyrolysis of plastic wastes in a semi-batch reactor The objective of this work is the study of the influence of temperature and time in the products obtained in the pyrolysis of plastic wastes. The thermal behaviour of a mixture, which resembles municipal plastic wastes has been studied both in a thermogravimetric analyser and in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor at atmospheric pressure in order to establish the most appropriate time–temperature combination for plastic waste pyrolysis. It has been proved by the authors that temperature has a strong effect in the characteristics of pyrolysis liquids and to a lesser extent in gas and solid properties. At the lowest temperature tested (460°C), a great proportion of extremely viscous liquids with high content of long hydrocarbon chains are obtained, while at the highest temperature tested (600°C) low proportion of liquids with a high content of aromatics is produced. The effect of time is not as strong as that of temperature except for very short reaction times (0–15min). 15–30min was established as the optimum reaction time range, since total conversion is achieved and longer reaction times do not produce any effect neither in conversion nor in products characteristics. 500°C has been found to be the most appropriate temperature for the pyrolysis of such plastic waste in terms of both conversion and quality of the products.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic waste in a semi-batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate: Online monitoring of gas production and quantitative analysis of waxy products The slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated over a range of final temperatures from 410 °C to 480 °C yielding a wide variety of species. The objective of the current study was to provide thermal dependent evolution profile for mass loss and pyrolysis gas, in addition to the partial quantification of the waxy products. The polymer degradation was first characterized by thermogravimetric analysis. Many parameters were studied such as final temperature, heating rate, flow rate and the presence or not of a lid on the crucible. The slow pyrolysis of PET was then performed in a horizontal tubular reactor at 5 °C/min. The pyrolysis products were analysed, focusing especially on gaseous and waxy fractions. The gas emitted was monitored online by μ-GC which allowed establishing their real time evolution profile. Carbonyl species were analyzed using HPLC. As a result, the gas contained mainly acetaldehyde, CO and CO2, and to a smaller extent ethylene and benzene. Benzene profile exhibited two peaks, indicating that there may be two steps or two main reactions in the release of this compound. The waxy products were characterized by GC/MS-FID and FTIR techniques. FTIR showed that the main chemical moieties of the waxy products were carboxylic acids and esters. GC/MS-FID confirmed that these pyrolysates contained mainly benzoic acid and its derivatives and monovinyl terephthalate. The quantitative analysis showed that the highest production of benzoic acid was obtained at 430 °C. Its yield is 11% of initial PET mass.","The study investigates slow pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in a lab-scale horizontal tubular reactor, reports measurable product yields (including 11% benzoic acid at 430 °C), and includes experimental characterization via GC/MS-FID, FTIR, and online μ-GC analysis."

The products were analyzed with GC-MS/FID to quantify phenolic compounds, alkanes and alkenes. The synergistic effect between plastics and lignin was studied by comparing the carbon yield of compounds from co-pyrolysis with that from individual pyrolysis.

"Fuel production based on catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires as an optimized model Recently, the pyrolysis of wastes has been considered as a promising alternative for dealing with this issue. In this study, pyrolysis of waste tire was conducted using MgCl2 as catalyst in a batch reactor under atmosphere of argon. The experiments of pyrolysis were designed by response surface modeling of process parameters, including particle size of waste tire slices, flow rate of argon gas, amount of catalyst, and time and temperature of pyrolysis, related to the corresponding yields of oil, gas, and char. As objectives of this work, influences of parameters and their interactions were examined to maximize oil, and minimize gas and char. The oil product was maximized using the conditions, including pyrolysis temperature of 407.3°C, pyrolysis time of 1800s, flow rate of 133.7mLmin−1, particle size of 12.5mm, and 11.5wt% of catalyst. Additionally, the highest gaseous product was also obtained when the temperature of pyrolysis, feed size, flow rate of argon, amount of catalyst, and pyrolysis time were 475.0°C, 5.0mm, 250.0mLmin−1, 0.1wt%, and 5009 s, respectively. Moreover, the pyrolytic char was converted to activated one with the specific surface area and activating yield of 1296m2 g−1 and 16.3 wt%, respectively, using steam activation unit. Furthermore, the physical properties of the final oil product, including cetane number, density, viscosity, and flash point were compared with other commercial diesel fuels. These quality factors were obtained 47, 847kgm−3, 2.4mm2 s−1, and 48°C, respectively. At last, using of MgCl2 declined the sulfur content of final oil to 0.38wt%.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires (a form of plastic waste) in a batch reactor with measurable yields, optimized conditions, and detailed product characterization including fuel properties and sulfur content."
"Principal component analysis for kinetic scheme proposal in the thermal pyrolysis of waste HDPE plastics Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to process the data obtained from the batch pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in order to recognize trends in the formation rates of the large number of components in the product stream. Two different criteria for component grouping have been compared, i.e., according to molecular size, and the nature of CC bond. The choice of the suitable criterion is crucial in order to establish the kinetic scheme, and PCA has proven to be a very helpful tool. The multivariate analysis applied to the lumps obtained according to the molecular size of the components provides very useful information, which allows proposing similar kinetic schemes to those in the literature, but with significant details involved in the definition of the lumps and their distribution between primary and secondary reactions. Furthermore, although there are substantial differences in the formation rate of single-ring aromatics (which are particularly affected by temperature), PCA carried out by grouping the products according to the nature of their CC bond does not provide relevant information concerning differences in the performance of the main products (aliphatic hydrocarbons).",The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste HDPE plastic with measurable product formation rates and multivariate analysis of experimental data to propose a kinetic scheme.
"Characterization and inventory of PBDD/F emissions from deca-BDE, polyethylene (PE) and metal blends during the pyrolysis process The thermal treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is regarded as the largest potential contributor to the environmental release of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Herein, the pyrolysis of decabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE), polyethylene (PE) and metal blends was conducted to investigate the emission characteristics of PBDD/Fs at different thermal treatment conditions. The total yield of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) was less than that of polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDFs) during the pyrolysis of the PE matrix and metal blends. 2,3,7,8-TBDF and 1,2,3,7,8-PBDF were the dominant congeners emitted from the pyrolysis. Temperature, presence of oxygen and type of added metal were the critical influencing factors for the PBDD/F formation rates and speciation in the pyrolysis process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (polyethylene) and metal blends, with measurable product yields and characterization of PBDD/F emissions under varying temperature and metal conditions."
"Unveiling the conditioning correlation in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins towards designated conversion into valuable products The ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefin plastics holds promise for producing aromatics and light olefins, with potential integrations in the low-carbon olefin processing industry for producing ethylene, propylene, butadiene, or aromatic hydrocarbons. Employing ZSM-5(50) zeolite, selected for its substantial specific surface area and total pore volume, facilitated the catalytic pyrolysis of household plastic waste through an ex-situ pyrolysis-catalysis approach. This study explored the impact of operating parameters, T1-T2- C/P mass ratio, namely pyrolysis temperature, catalytic vapor upgrading temperature, and the catalyst/plastic mass ratio, on pyrolysis product yields and distributions. Higher T2 benefited gas production, accompanied by a notable decrease in C4 content in gaseous products. A larger C/P mass ratio provided more active sites for pyrolysis reactions, but higher T2 induced coke formation on the catalyst, leading to ZSM-5(50) deactivation and inhibiting further gas production. Positive effects of T2 and the C/P mass ratio were observed for the concentration of BTX in the produced oil. The quadratic fitting was engaged in characterising the reaction conditions. Specifically, the 500–550–0.25 run achieved the maximum C2 yield of 30.3 wt%, the 500–350–0.4 run obtained the highest yield of C3 and C4 of 75.4 wt%, and the run of 575–450–0.25 yielded the highest amount of BTX of 17.2 wt%. These findings provide valuable insights into the designated conditioning of catalytic pyrolysis for plastic waste valorisation.","The study involves lab-scale ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefin plastics with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Improving hydrocarbons production via catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied-biomass with plastics and dual catalytic pyrolysis To increase the low yield and selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons during the biomass pyrolysis process, we torrefied the biomass and then co-pyrolyzing with plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) and polypropylene (PP) and also single and dual catalyst layouts were investigated by Py-GC/MS. The results showed that non-catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of raw bagasse (RBG) generated no aromatics. After torrefaction non-CFP of torrefied bagasse (TBG) generated low aromatic yield. Indicating that torrefaction would enhance the proportion of aromatics during the pyrolysis process. The CFP of TBG200°C and TBG240°C over ZSM-5 produced the total aromatic yield of 1.96 and 1.88 times higher, respectively, compared to non-CFP of TBG. Furthermore, the addition of plastic could increase H/Ceff ratio of the mixture, consequently, increase the yield of aromatic compounds. Among the various torrefied-bagasse/plastic mixtures, the CFP of TBG/EVA (7:3 ratio) mixture generated the highest the total aromatic yield of 7.7 times more than the CFP of TBG alone. The dual catalyst layout could enhance the yield of aromatics hydrocarbons. The dual-catalytic co-pyrolysis of TBG200°C/plastic (1:1) ratio over USY (ultra-stable Y zeolite)/ZSM-5, improved the total aromatics yield by 4.33 times more than the catalytic pyrolysis of TBG200oC alone over ZSM-5 catalyst. The above results showed that the yield and selectivities of light aromatic hydrocarbons can be improved via catalytic co-pyrolysis and dual catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied-biomass with plastics.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PS, EVA, PP) with torrefied biomass in a lab-scale reactor, with measurable yields of aromatic hydrocarbons and catalyst performance data reported."
"Oxy-hydrogen, solar and wind assisted hydrogen ( H 2 ) recovery from municipal plastic waste (MPW) and saltwater electrolysis for better environmental systems and ocean cleanup The pyrolysis of plastic waste and the electrolysis of saltwater is a promising route to carbon neutrality in ocean cleanup and plastic waste management. Therefore, a solar and wind assisted H 2 -fuelled fast pyrolysis of MPW (municipal plastic waste) and electrolysis of desalinated saline were developed. The combined system uses an oxy-hydrogen furnace for thermal decomposition of MPW feed, C O 2 as an inert reaction medium and both solar and wind energy systems to operate the electrical units. The deionised H 2 O feed to the electrolyser cell was produced from saltwater using the recovered heat from the fast pyrolyser unit. The process C O 2 was captured and reused for soil improvement as current waste-to-energy routes of MPW recycling emit 695,850 tonnes of C O 2 . 2.65 k g / h r H 2 fuel in an O 2 environment was utilised to meet the decomposer operating temperature and heat duty which is approximately 29 % of the produced H 2 . Instability associated with bio-oil was prevented by using fast pyrolysis which release more volatiles. Compared to the related studies, this investigated work achieved the highest gas and carbon yields. Thermal N O < 0.1 ppm was recorded. The developed system is expected to reach ≥70 % energy efficiency and a sales price of < $3.89/ k g H 2 .","The abstract describes lab-scale fast pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste with measurable yields, reactor conditions, and product analysis, including gas and carbon yields, thermal NO levels, and energy efficiency metrics."
"Catalytic hydrocracking of heavy wax from pyrolysis of plastic wastes using Pd/Hβ for naphtha-ranged hydrocarbon production The catalytic hydrocracking of heavy wax derived from the pyrolysis of waste plastics was conducted for valuable naphtha production on the bifunctional catalyst. As the result of the support screening to prepare the bifunctional catalyst, the acidic Hβ was chosen, which exhibited the reasonable wax conversion (64%) and the highest saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon content (98%) in naphtha fraction at 380 ̊C. Then, Pd was impregnated on the Hβ as an active metal, and ≥ 0.6% Pd could dramatically improve the cracking and hydrogenation activities of the Hβ even at 360 ̊C from 47.9% to >97.5% conversion. Also, the liquid product mainly composed of saturated hydrocarbons (88% paraffins), which is quite suitable for naphtha. Especially, Pd[0.6]/Hβ, having 0.012 of the metal/acids ratio, exhibited the highest hydrocracking activity (99.2% conversion and 97.8% naphtha fraction in liquid), and that of >0.012 led catalyst’s isomerization activity increased.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastics to produce heavy wax, followed by catalytic hydrocracking experiments with measurable yields, conversion rates, and product composition analysis."
"Chemical recycling of EPDM waste through pyrolysis: Exploring the feasibility of a circular economy model Ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) is widely used in many industrial sectors. EPDM’s physical and chemical properties make it highly durable, flexible and resistant, while posing significant recycling challenges. The development of a circular economy for rubber compounds is a remarkable challenge for the sustainability of this industry, and pyrolysis offers interesting characteristics for the recovery of value-added raw materials from waste EPDM. This process converts EPDM rubber into raw recovered carbon black (RRCB), pyrolysis gas (PyG) and pyrolysis oil (PyO). This work studies the pyrolysis of EPDM in a lab-scale plant with two reactors in series in order to tune the yield and properties of the products to potentiate their value. While the first reactor controls the temperature effect for high quality RRCB production, the second reactor serves to thermally crack the volatiles released. The results show that the RRCB produced has a potential use as substitute for virgin carbon black (CB). Likewise, the PyO can be cracked from linear, cyclic, and heterocyclic hydrocarbon compounds to aromatic ones. In addition, PyG with high C2 and C3 gas content is highly promoted at higher cracking temperatures. This composition of PyG is seen as very promising in promoting circularity within the EPDM industry, as ethylene and propylene are the main basic chemicals for EPDM production. The developed process may serve as a promising approach to sustainable chemical recycling, balancing cost-efficiency with environmental responsibility, notably by reducing the carbon footprint through the use of RRCB as a replacement of conventional CB.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste EPDM rubber, a commercial plastic-like polymer, with measurable product yields and compositional analysis of pyrolysis oil, gas, and recovered carbon black."
"Polymer waste recycling over “used” catalysts Catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was carried out under nitrogen using a laboratory fluidised bed reactor operating at 360°C with catalyst to polymer feed ratio of 2:1 and at 450°C with catalyst to polymer feed ratio of 6:1 under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts used in this study were ZSM-5, US-Y, ASA, fresh FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) commercial catalyst (Cat-A) and equilibrium FCC catalysts with different levels of metal poisoning were studied. The initial results for polymer degradation at 360°C (catalyst to polymer ratio of 2:1) in a fluidised bed reactor in terms of the yield of volatile hydrocarbon products were: model catalysts>commercial FCC catalyst>E-Cats. However, when the process conditions more closely resembled to FCC conditions, the fresh commercial FCC catalyst was more favourable in terms of the yield of volatile hydrocarbon products. The degradation of HDPE over E-Cats although reduced was similar to ASA in product selectivity and yield, and the level of metal contamination did not affect the product stream generated. A simple economic evaluation of polymer recycling process is reported showing that a catalytic system based on E-Cats appears comparable in costs to a commercial thermal cracking plant.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Semivolatile and volatile compounds from the pyrolysis and combustion of polyvinyl chloride Emissions evolved from the pyrolysis and combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied at four different temperatures (500, 700, 850 and 1000°C) in a horizontal laboratory tubular quartz reactor in order to analyse the influence of both temperature and reaction atmosphere on the final products from thermal and oxidative reactions. It was observed that the CO2/CO ratio increased with temperature. Methane was the only light hydrocarbon whose yield increased with temperature up to 1000°C. Benzene was rather stable at high temperatures, but in general, combustion at temperatures above 500°C was enough to destroy light hydrocarbons. Semivolatile hydrocarbons were collected in XAD-2 resin and more than 160 compounds were detected. Trends on polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) yields showed that most had a maximum at 850°C in pyrolysis, but naphthalene at 700°C. Formation of chlorinated aromatics was detected. A detailed analysis of all isomers of chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols was performed. Both of them reached higher total yields in combustion runs, the first ones having a maximum at 700°C and the latter at 500°C. Pyrolysis and combustion runs at 850°C were conducted to study the formation of polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs). There was more than 20-fold increase in total yields from pyrolysis to combustion, and PCDF yields represented in each case about 10 times PCDD yields.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PVC waste plastic at specified temperatures in a quartz reactor, with measurable product yields and detailed analytical characterization of volatile and semivolatile compounds, including PAHs, chlorinated aromatics, PCDDs, and PCDFs."
"Continuous-distribution kinetics for degradation of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) in supercritical methanol The depolymerization of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) in supercritical methanol was investigated by using a batch autoclave reactor. Continuous kinetics analysis was applied to experimental data. It was observed that PBT could dissolve into supercritical methanol quickly and decompose completely in a homogeneous phase. PBT with average molecular weight of about 29 700 was converted to oligomer with that of 4200 within 10 min and with that of 2700 in 15 min at 513 K and converted into monomer completely within 22 min. The main reaction products decomposed of PBT were dimethylterephthalate (DMT) and 1, 4-butanediol (BG) by methanolysis. The yields of monomer components of the decomposition products, including byproducts were measured. The yields of DMT and BG could reach 94.5% and 70.1%, respectively, at 563 K for 75 min. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the products, a depolymerization-reaction scheme was proposed to explain the reaction mechanism, i.e. the degradation of PBT in supercritical methanol mainly includes random scission and chain-end scission reactions and side reactions for monomer components. With the process of degradation, some oligomers could be decomposed into small molecular products by side reactions. Continuous-distribution kinetics theory was developed to analyze the decomposition behavior. The energy of activation for the random scissions of PBT in the supercritical methanol was 86.53 kJ/mol.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), a commercial plastic, in a batch autoclave reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Enhanced biofuel production by co-pyrolysis of distiller's grains and waste plastics: A quantitative appraisal of kinetic behaviors and product characteristics Pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks can produce valuable biofuel, however, the final products may present excessive corrosion and poor stability due to the lack of hydrogen content. Co-pyrolysis with hydrogen-rich substances such as waste plastics may compensate for these shortcomings. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of a common biomass, i.e. distiller's grains (DG), and waste polypropylene plastic (PP) were investigated towards increasing the quantity and quality of the production of biofuel. Results from the thermogravimetric analyses showed that the reaction interval of individual pyrolysis of DG and PP was 124–471 °C and 260–461 °C, respectively. Conversely, an interaction effect between DG and PP was observed during co-pyrolysis, resulting in a slower rate of weight loss, a longer temperature range for the pyrolysis reaction, and an increase in the temperature difference between the evolution of products. Likewise, the Coats-Redfern model showed that the activation energies of DG, PP and an equal mixture of both were 42.90, 130.27 and 47.74 kJ mol−1, respectively. It thus follows that co-pyrolysis of DG and PP can effectively reduce the activation energy of the reaction system and promote the degree of pyrolysis. Synergistic effects essentially promoted the free radical reaction of the PP during co-pyrolysis, thereby reducing the activation energy of the process. Moreover, due to this synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis of DG and PP, the ratio of elements was effectively optimized, especially the content of oxygen-containing species was reduced, and the hydrocarbon content of products was increased. These results will not only advance our understanding of the characteristics of co-pyrolysis of DG and PP, but will also support further research toward improving an efficient co-pyrolysis reactor system and the pyrolysis process itself.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene plastic and distiller's grains, with measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Thermogravimetric kinetic analysis and pollutant evolution during the pyrolysis and combustion of mobile phone case The increase in electronic waste, including cellular telephones, worldwide is a worrying reality. For this reason, urgent action on the management of these wastes is necessary within a framework that respects the environment and human health. Mobile phone components can be physically segregated through grinding at the dismantling sites, in order to reuse or reprocess (via chemical or physical recycling) the recovered plastics and valuable metals. A kinetic study of the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case has been carried out under different conditions by thermogravimetry. Several experiments were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere (pyrolysis runs) and also in an oxidative atmosphere with two different oxygen concentrations (10% and 20% oxygen in nitrogen). Dynamic runs and dynamic+isothermal runs have been carried out to obtain much decomposition data under different operating conditions. Moreover some TG–MS runs were performed in order to better understand the thermal decomposition of a mobile phone case and identify some compounds emitted during the controlled heating of this material. A scheme of two independent reactions for pseudocomponents has been proposed for the pyrolysis process. For the combustion runs, the scheme proposed includes two pyrolytic reactions competing with other two reactions with formation of an intermediate residue, and finally the reaction of oxidation/burning of the intermediate residue. Furthermore, pyrolysis and combustion runs at 500°C in a horizontal laboratory furnace were carried out. More than 50 compounds, including carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified and quantified. The main semivolatile compounds detected were phenol and styrene. Furthermore, polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like PCBs produced were analyzed. In the combustion run, PCDDs were obtained in higher amounts than PCDFs and HxCDD was the most emitted homologue.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of a mobile phone case, a waste plastic, with measured product yields, identified compounds, and reactor conditions, including TG–MS and furnace runs at 500°C."
"Energy recovery from high density polyethylene plastic via pyrolysis with upgrading of the product by a novel nano MIL-53 (Cu) derived@Y zeolite catalyst using response surface methodology Pyrolysis of plastics is an economical method to recover valuable fuels from waste sources. In this study, the response surface methodology is adopted to model the behavior for the pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The three operating parameters of temperature in the range of 415 to 585 ° C, feed density in a window between 959 and 967 kg/m 3 and reactor loading range from 23 to 57% were selected as the main variables. Using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) study for different heat transfer rates, the range at which the feed is fully converted was determined, thus ensuring that the correct operating temperature range was selected. By drawing difference thermogravimetry (DTG) curves and using a dynamic model, the activation energy for converting heavy and light feeds was determined to be 300.984 and 273.57 kJ/mol, respectively. Analysis of the experimental results using the (Central Composite Design) CCD method shows the ease of pyrolysis of light feed, which is agreed upon with less activation energy. As the main goal of this study, the effect of parameters on the liquid fuel production was investigated, and it was turned out that under optimum conditions, the amount of liquid fuel production will be 95.3%. For the optimal conditions, a temperature of 500 ° C, feed density is 963 kg/m 3 and reactor loading rate of 40% were determined. Analysis of the exhaust gases also showed that propylene and ethane are the most abundant components of this phase. Furthermore, with the help of analysis of variance, the proposed model to produce liquid fuel and gas yield was evaluated as a significant and the accurate model. Finally, under the optimized conditions, by using a new MIL-53 (Cu) derived @ Zeolite Y catalyst, the percentage of heavy compounds in the fuel was meaningfully reduced, and at the same time, the octane number of the gasoline produced was considerably improved. Based on the energy considerations, it was calculated that the recovery of energy from combustion as well as the sensible energy of the exhaust gases from the reactor, leads to significant savings in total energy consumption to produce each gram of liquid fuel.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization, including GC–MS and TGA, under defined reactor conditions."
"Tertiary recycling of polyethylene: mechanism of liquid production from polyethylene by thermolysis/reactive distillation Thermolysis coupled with reactive distillation was studied as a potential process for the tertiary recycling of polyethylene. The reactions were carried out at 440°C and under a nitrogen atmosphere. Processing under these conditions allowed for a higher conversion of polyethylene into a condensable liquid product than is usually reported with conventional pyrolysis. The products obtained from this study were characterized by a high concentration of straight-chain α-olefins. The relative importance of the various steps in the mechanism of thermal degradation of polyethylene was found to be very different from that observed in other studies employing just thermolysis or pyrolysis. In addition to molecular weight reduction by random scission, intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen transfer steps were found to be very important to the production of liquid. Intramolecular hydrogen transfer followed by β-scission was also found to be an important mechanism for the production of short chain length α-olefins.","The study involves lab-scale thermolysis of polyethylene waste, with measured product yields and characterization of liquid products, including analysis of α-olefin composition and reaction mechanisms."
"Catalytic cracking of polystyrene pyrolysis oil: Effect of Nb2O5 and NiO/Nb2O5 catalyst on the liquid product composition The catalytic cracking of polystyrene pyrolysis oil was investigated over a Nb2O5 and a NiO/Nb2O5 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor. First, the pyrolysis of two different polystyrene feedstock (polystyrene foam and polystyrene pellet) was carried out in a semi-batch reactor, and the resulting polystyrene pellets pyrolysis oil was selected for catalytic cracking reaction because of its high liquid yield (85%). Catalytic cracking experiments were then performed at different temperatures (350–500 °C) using Nb2O5 or NiO/Nb2O5 catalyst. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of liquid product obtained from the catalytic cracking process showed that the dimers in the pyrolysis oil were converted to monomers during the catalytic cracking process. The catalytic cracking results also showed that the NiO/Nb2O5 catalyst (having slightly higher acidic sites) had slightly higher activity for monomer conversion than the Nb2O5 catalyst (having less acidic sites). X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, pyridine Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, NH3 Temperature Programmed Desorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the catalyst. The highest catalytic cracking activity was observed at 400 °C with the Nb2O5 catalyst with 4% toluene, 6% ethylbenzene, approximately 50% styrene, 13% α-methyl styrene, and only 6% of dimers in the liquid oil. The increase in temperature positively affected the yield of gases during catalytic cracking process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a semi-batch reactor followed by catalytic cracking with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent performance, and detailed analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Impact of plastic composition on the performance of the integrated process of pyrolysis and oxidative steam reforming for hydrogen production The pyrolysis and oxidative steam reforming (P-OSR) of different types of plastics (HDPE, PP, PET and PS) has been carried out in a two reactor system provided with a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR). The effect plastic composition has on the oxidative steam reforming step has been analyzed using two space time values (3.1 gcatalyst min gplastic −1 and 12.5 gcatalyst min gplastic −1) at a reforming temperature of 700 °C, S/P ratio of 3 and ER of 0.2 (optimum conditions for autothermal reforming). The different composition of the plastics leads to differences in the yields and compositions of pyrolysis products, and consequently in the performance of the oxidative steam reforming step. High conversions (> 97 %) have been achieved by using a space time of 12.5 gcat min gplastic −1, with H2 production increasing as follows: PET ≪ PS < HDPE ≤ PP. A maximum H2 production of 25.5 wt% has been obtained by using PP, which is lower than that obtained in the process of pyrolysis and in line conventional steam reforming (P-SR) of the same feedstock (34.8 wt%). The lowest H2 production (10.5 wt%) has been achieved when PET was used due to the high oxygen content of this plastic. The results obtained in this study prove that P-OSR performs very well with different feedstock, thereby confirming the versatility and efficiency of this process to produce a hydrogen-rich gas.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PET, PS) in a two-reactor system, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance data reported."
"Towards enhanced catalytic reactivity in CO2-assisted gasification of polypropylene The role of catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) position on improved gasification of polypropylene (PP) in CO2 atmosphere using a fixed bed reactor at 900 °C was examined and the results compared with non-catalytic gasification. The catalytic gasification included in-situ and quasi-in-situ (with feedstock located close to but not directly in contact with the catalyst) configuration. Results are reported on the evolutionary behavior and yield of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), hydrocarbons (C m H n ) and total syngas. Compared to non-catalytic gasification, in-situ, and quasi-in-situ catalytic gasification produced higher H2 by 120.5% and 137.1%, higher CO by 38.2% and 24.0%, higher C m H n by 57.1% and 98.2%, and higher total syngas by 44.1% and 43.8%, respectively. CO2-assisted gasification of PP with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst significantly enhanced the gases evolution rate and improved the syngas yield. Results revealed better catalytic activity with quasi-in-situ configuration in the thermal decomposition of PP into H2 and C m H n than in-situ catalytic configuration. However, in-situ catalytic configuration provided more CO under similar gasification conditions. Approximately 0.8, 1.1 and 1.0 kg of CO2 could be consumed per kg of PP feedstock to generate syngas energy yield of 27.5, 43.1 and 48.1 MJ with non-catalytic, in-situ and quasi-in-situ catalytic configuration, respectively, suggesting efficient utilization of both CO2 and PP waste for clean and efficient energy production.","The study involves catalytic gasification of polypropylene (PP) in a fixed-bed reactor, which is a form of plastic pyrolysis, with measurable product yields and performance data for syngas components."
"Fast pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastic in a fluidized bed reactor Co-pyrolysis of red oak and high density polyethylene (HDPE) was conducted in a laboratory-scale, continuous fluidized bed reactor in a temperature range from 525 to 675°C. Pyrolysis products, including two fractions of pyrolysis-oil, non-condensable gases and char were analyzed to assess the influence of pyrolysis temperature and co-feeding of biomass with HDPE. It was found that increasing pyrolysis temperature up to 625°C promoted the production of pyrolysis-oil and its yield reached 57.6wt%. Further increase in pyrolysis temperature caused the cracking of pyrolysis-oil to form light gases rich in hydrocarbons. Organic phase of pyrolysis-oil produced from plastic-biomass mixture (PBM) had a higher heating value (HHV) up to 36.6MJ/kg contributed by the additive effect of HDPE-derived aliphatic hydrocarbons. A significant synergetic effect was also observed during co-pyrolysis. Co-pyrolysis with HDPE increased the production of furan, acids and water from red oak. Co-presence of HDPE also inhibited char formation from red oak and improved the HHV of the resulting char. The char produced from co-pyrolysis had a significantly lower BET surface area than red oak biochar. Not only did HDPE-derived particulate matter blocks the pores, the synergetic interaction also resulted in the formation of large and shallow micro-pores on the char surface.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastic (HDPE) and biomass in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Catalytic pyrolysis characteristics of polystyrene by biomass char-supported nanocatalysts Plastics originate from the synthesis of chemical products, and the regeneration of chemical products from waste plastics through catalytic pyrolysis helps to reduce the dependence on fossil resources and improve the treatment of waste, which is an important aspect of current sustainable social development. In this study, metasequoia was used as a biomass precursor and three porous char-supported nanocatalysts (Fe-MEC, Ni-MEC, and Co-MEC) were synthesized via a simple and feasible microwave heating method, which were then used as catalysts for the preparation of high-quality liquid oil from polystyrene powder via an ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis method. The results indicate that Fe-MEC, Ni-MEC, and Co-MEC possessed good pore structures due to the microwave-heating and catalytic effect of these metals, and metal nanoparticles are generated and uniformly anchored on the matrix of the char support. Using these catalysts, the yield of liquid product from polystyrene pyrolysis decreased slightly, while the gas yield increased slightly. Fe-MEC catalysis reached the highest liquid yield of 91% among the three catalysts. The catalysts can improve the yield of a series of high-value liquid products such as toluene, ethylbenzene, and α-methyl styrene. The catalysts also exhibited excellent cycle stability, and carbon nanotubes were formed which are less prone to deactivation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (a commercial plastic) using biomass char-supported nanocatalysts, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of mechanically non-recyclable waste plastics mixture: Kinetics and pyrolysis in laboratory-scale reactor Post-consumer waste plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled represent a concerning environmental issue. According to the latest available data for Europe, as much as 25% of collected post-consumer waste plastics are landfilled, 43% is energy recovered, and 32% is recycled. One possible way of recovering non-recyclable plastics is pyrolysis, which is considered environmentally friendly technology for obtaining fuel or chemicals from plastic waste. To tackle the challenge of recovering non-recyclable plastics via pyrolysis, it is necessary to determine their actual composition. Visual separation of collected non-recyclable plastics was performed, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the accuracy of visual separation. A significant amount of plastics labelled as “other” was found. Since the composition of “other” waste plastics has not been sufficiently investigated, relatively few studies on their pyrolysis have been conducted. Therefore, they were characterised and added to the mixture with other found polymer types of non-recyclable plastics. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to determine thermochemical behaviour and kinetic parameters required for laboratory pyrolysis investigation. Kinetic analysis was conducted using the Friedman isoconversional model-free method and non-linear multivariate regression method. The goal of this paper was to analyse the kinetics, determine the product yield and characteristics of the pyrolysis process of non-recyclable plastics over zeolite catalysts. It was found how the decomposition of non-recyclable plastics occurs in two decomposition steps. The activation energy of non-recyclable plastics was 144 kJ/mol in the first stage of decomposition and 262 kJ/mol in the second stage of decomposition. It decreased by 34% and 6.5% after fresh fluid catalytic cracking catalyst was added and 41% and 18.3% with iron-modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalyst. The yield of condensate was 55% (wax) for the original sample, and it decreased to 50% (wax and oil) and 27% (mostly oil) with fresh fluid catalytic cracking and iron modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalysts. Processes with catalysts promoted the formation of olefins and aromatic compounds in pyrolytic oil. All pyrolysis products had a high value of higher heating value ranging from 39 MJ/kg to 43 MJ/kg showing good potential for further energy use.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of non-recyclable waste plastics, with measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Thermal processing of plastics from waste electrical and electronic equipment for hydrogen production Plastic waste from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) produced from a real-world commercial WEEE recycling centre has been processed using pyrolysis–gasification using a two-stage reaction system to produce hydrogen. In the first stage, the plastic fraction was pyrolysed at 600°C and the evolved pyrolysis gases were passed directly to a second reactor at 800°C and reacted with steam in the presence of a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) which were the main components of the WEEE plastic were reacted to compare with the WEEE plastic. The results showed that the introduction of steam and the catalyst increased the yield of hydrogen. Increasing the nickel content in the catalyst also resulted in higher hydrogen yield. The comparison of the results of WEEE with those of HIPS and ABS showed that WEEE plastic was mainly composed of ABS. The catalyst, after reaction, showed significant deposition of coke composed of filamentous and layered type carbon. Overall the novel processing of waste plastic from electrical and electronic equipment using a two stage pyrolysis–gasification reactor shows great promise for the production of hydrogen.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HIPS and ABS) from WEEE, with measured hydrogen yields, catalyst performance, and product characterization using experimental reactor conditions and analytical methods."
"Monomer recovery by pyrolysis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) There are many processes to recover the valuable methylmethacrylate (MMA) of PMMA waste. The yield of MMA using melting vessels or heated screw feeders is not sufficient and lies between 50 and 80 wt%. In a indirectly heated fluidized bed process with a temperature of 450°C more than 97 wt% of the PMMA could be recovered as monomer. The yield depends on the pyrolysis temperature. At 590°C the gas fraction increases drastically. The main components of the gas are methane, ethene, propene, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The main component in the liquid beside the MMA is methyl acrylate. It is possible to polymerize the liquid to new PMMA after distillation without any other purification. Even filled and coloured PMMA materials like rear lights of cars could be polymerized to a polymerization grade liquid.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PMMA plastic, reports measurable yields and product composition, and includes experimental conditions such as temperature and reactor type."
"Kinetic identification of plastic waste pyrolysis on zeolite-based catalysts Pyrolysis of waste polymers looks an attractive way for their recycling as valuable hydrocarbons are produced that can be utilized as cleaner energy carriers or petrochemical feedstock. The lumping approach is often used to study the reaction kinetics of such complex systems as the high number of individual chemical species formed during pyrolysis and the several reactions that take place between them make the detailed kinetic modeling of the process often not feasible. Here we propose a two-step identification strategy, which requires no a priori knowledge regarding fast and slow reactions or the temperature dependence of the rate coefficients, to determine the kinetic parameters of pyrolysis and estimate product composition with the required precision using the discrete lumping method. Pyrolysis of a shredded real waste HDPE/PP/LDPE mixture was carried out previously in a laboratory scale two-stage reactor operated in batch mode. The process was investigated at different temperatures; both thermal and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis were studied, the latter on different types of zeolite-based catalysts. Our results indicate that with the suggested lumped model and kinetic identification strategy not only the experimental results can be reproduced but also the essential behavior of different catalysts can be explained. Furthermore, the two stages of the pyrolysis process have also been able to be differentiated. It can be stated that with the proper selection of pseudocomponents, the lumping approach is appropriate for catalyst evaluation and comparison as well, leading to a better understanding of the previous experimental results and the overall pyrolysis process. Hence, the results might also be used during process design or scale-up.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of a real waste HDPE/PP/LDPE mixture using a batch reactor with catalysts, reports temperature-dependent product yields, and includes experimental characterization and kinetic analysis."
"Sustainable valorization of styrofoam and CO2 into syngas Plastic is a versatile material broadly used in a variety of industries. However, the current disposal practices for plastic wastes (incineration/landfilling) add the hazardous materials into the environment. To offer a sustainable valorization platform for plastic waste, this study adopted the catalytic pyrolysis process using CO2 as a co-feedstock. A model plastic waste collected from a seaport was waste buoy (WB), which has been widely used in fishing industry. Prior to the pyrolysis tests, the exact type of plastic in WB and the thermolytic characteristics of WB were examined. Since the WB was made of polystyrene, it was mainly converted into styrene monomer (styrene), dimer (diphenyl-1-butene), and trimer (2,4,6-triphenyl-1-hexene) from pyrolysis of WB. To further valorize/detoxify styrene derivatives into value-added syngas, catalytic pyrolysis of WB was practiced using the Ni-based catalysts (2/5/10 wt% Ni/SiO2). The yield of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis process of WB was more than one magnitude higher comparing to that from the non-catalytic one. H2 formation also increased as catalyst loading increased. When flow gas was switched from inert gas to CO2, CO gas formation was enhanced due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and styrene derivatives over Ni catalysts. Syngas (H2/CO) formation under the CO2 condition was 5 times higher in comparison to the N2 condition in catalytic pyrolyses of WB with 10 wt% Ni/SiO2. CO2 also effectively suppressed coke deposition on a Ni catalyst.

"PP upcycling employing FCC spent catalyst: The role of contaminants, atmosphere and pressure Innovative and sustainable approaches are being pursued to convert plastic waste into high-value fuels, particularly without using noble metal catalysts or external hydrogen sources. In this scenario, we explored the utilization of a spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst (ECAT), aiming to enhance the yield and quality of products through catalytic cracking of Polypropylene (PP) under different reaction conditions. Under a 20 bar H2 atmosphere, ECAT efficiently cracked PP into alkanes (71.6 %) and aromatics (25.5 %), with minimal alkenes (2.2 %) production. Similarly, under a 20 bar N2 atmosphere, ECAT achieved comparable conversion levels, producing mainly saturated hydrocarbons, which was intriguing. However, tests conducted at 1 bar N2 pressure showed that PP conversion remains unaffected but presents higher olefins’ yield and lower aromatics than ECAT. Thus, pressure seems to favor aromatization and in situ hydrogen transfer. By comparing the performance of ECAT with commercial CBV 712 zeolite, we propose that PP acts as an internal hydrogen source, eliminating the need for external supply improving efficiency and selectivity. Interestingly, mechanistic insights suggested that dehydroaromatization and hydrogen transfer within zeolite pores were dominant, and pressure (H2 or N2) could have helped it. In addition, contrary to previous studies that claim that metal contaminants in ECAT are essential for the hydrogenation process, our findings suggest that for this particular ECAT composition, we do not observe any boost in alkane yield due to the presence of these metals. Hence, our study comprehensively evaluates different strategies that can be employed to promote PP upcycling promoted by ECAT.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) waste using a spent FCC catalyst under varying pressure and atmosphere conditions, with measurable product yields and compositional analysis."
"Highly selective conversion of mixed polyolefins to valuable base chemicals using phosphorus-modified and steam-treated mesoporous HZSM-5 zeolite with minimal carbon footprint Catalytic fast pyrolysis of polyolefinic waste streams was investigated to recover valuable base chemicals at high selectivity. HZSM-5 zeolite with different properties, affected by Si/Al, mesoporosity, phosphorus stabilization, and steaming, were tested and thoroughly characterized. Different feeds, catalyst/feed ratios and reaction temperatures were evaluated in a micropyrolysis reactor coupled to two-dimensional gas chromatography. While unmodified HZSM-5 rapidly deactivated, phosphorus-modified and steamtreated HZSM-5 showed almost no deactivation due to its lower coking propensity during 130 runs with stable conversion towards C5+ aliphatics and high C2-C4 olefins selectivity (~75%) using post-consumer mixed polyolefins. The performance of this direct olefins production route with unprecedented high olefin selectivity was further evaluated in a plantwide context. It was found that it requires ~37% lower energy input than the plastics pyrolysis followed by pyrolytic oil steam cracking, while it results to at least a one order of magnitude lower environmental burden as compared to waste incineration.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic fast pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed polyolefins using a micropyrolysis reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization."
"Catalytic conversion of polyolefins into fuels over zeolite beta The catalytic degradation of polypropylene and both low- and high-density polyethylene over different samples of zeolite beta has been investigated. Zeolite beta synthesized by the fluoride method has a low activity for the cracking of polyolefins, which is related to its large crystal size (12 μm) and poor aluminium incorporation. In contrast, zeolite beta synthesized from amorphous xerogels consists of small crystallites (⩽200 nm) and allows all the polyolefins to be degraded with high conversion (40–60%) and good selectivity towards C5–C12 hydrocarbons (60–70%), heavier products being hardly obtained (<6%). The incorporation of titanium into the BEA structure has been proved to enhance the catalytic activity, as denoted by the highest conversion per Al atom obtained with the Ti–Al-beta sample compared to Al-beta.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (PP, HDPE, LDPE) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Study of the pyrolysis of municipal solid waste for the production of valuable products To obtain information on the potential of thermal conversion (pyrolysis) of municipal solid waste (MSW), a thermogravimetric study (TGA) is performed in a stream of nitrogen. Based on TGA results, pyrolysis experiments are carried out in a semi-batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere. Slow pyrolysis is performed up to 550°C (heating rate of 4°C/min). Fast pyrolysis is performed at 450, 480, 510 and 550°C and different input transfer rates (12 or 24g material/min). The pyrolysis products are studied on composition and yield/distribution and investigated for their use as valuable product. The liquid obtained by slow pyrolysis separates spontaneously in a water rich product and an oily product. For all fast pyrolysis conditions, a viscous, brown oil which contains a poly(ethylene-co-propylene) wax is obtained. Composition analyses by GC/MS of the oil products (slow/fast pyrolysis) show that aliphatic hydrocarbons are the major compounds. The pyrolysis oils have high calorific value (between 35 and 44MJ/kg), low wt% of water (around 6wt%) and a low O/C value (between 0.2 and 0.3). The presence of waxy material is probably due to incomplete breakdown of poly(ethylene-co-propylene) present in MSW under study. The optimal pyrolysis conditions, regarding to oil yield, fuel properties, and wax yield is fast pyrolysis at 510°C with 24g material/min input transfer rate. The fast pyrolysis gases contain mainly hydrocarbons and have an averaged LHV around 20MJ/Nm3. ICP-AES analyses of pyrolysis products reveal that almost none of the metals present in MSW are distributed within the liquid fractions.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal solid waste containing plastic waste, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization of oils and gases."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste over nano MIL-53 (Cu) derived @ zeolite Y for gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel range fuel production In this study, municipal polymer wastes that were no longer recyclable and were previously buried underground according to the usual municipal waste management program were converted to liquid fuel by catalytic pyrolysis technique. In the first step, zeolite Y catalyst was used to improve the quality of liquid fuel. In the second step, MIL-53 (Cu) was incorporated onto zeolite and pyrolyzed in nitrogen in the atmosphere. The analysis shows that clusters of carbon nanopores with a copper core, and its oxides were deposited on the zeolite. For both types of catalysts, the crystallization time of zeolite was investigated, and it was found that this leads to the synthesis of samples with different percentages of crystallinity. For each test, the liquid fuel produced was divided into four cuts: gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, and wax. The test results in a fixed bed reactor for every twelve samples of catalyst and their effect on the efficiency of different sections of liquid fuel show a significant improvement in the desired product. The properties and morphology of the catalysts were investigated. It was found that at 400 °C and a crystallization time of 18 h for support with 76.62% crystallinity, gasoline production efficiency will be 37.00%. At 500 °C and low crystallinity, the tendency of reaction to produce jet fuel with a maximum efficiency of 48.64%. Furthermore, the physical properties of each cut of liquid fuel and their comparison with the reported values indicating the appropriate qualities of the produced fuel were evaluated. In the optimal state, the octane number of the produced gasoline is 93.5 and its pour point is 41 °C. Also, a jet fuel with an octane number of 43.2 and a flashpoint of 69 °C has been obtained. In the case of diesel, the octane number and its viscosity have reached 46 and 2.407 cp, respectively. Examining the results obtained from GC MS, it was found that the zeolite catalyst modified by Diels Alder mechanism and branching will improve the quality of liquid fuel and on the other hand, will cause the cracking of the wax compounds and reduce their percentage in product analysis.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and analytical characterization of catalysts and products."
"Effect of decabromodiphenyl ether and antimony trioxide on controlled pyrolysis of high-impact polystyrene mixed with polyolefins The controlled pyrolysis of polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrene mixed with brominated high-impact polystyrene containing decabromodiphenyl ether as a brominated flame-retardant with antimony trioxide as a synergist was performed. The effect of decabromodiphenyl ether and antimony trioxide on the formation of its congeners and their effect on distribution of pyrolysis products were investigated. The controlled pyrolysis significantly affected the decomposition behavior and the formation of products. Analysis with gas chromatograph with electron capture detector confirmed that the bromine content was rich in step 1 (oil 1) liquid products leaving less bromine content in the step 2 (oil 2) liquid products. In the presence of antimony containing samples, the major portion of bromine was observed in the form of antimony bromide and no flame-retardant species were found in oil 1. In the presence of synergist, the step 1 and step 2 oils contain both light and heavy compounds. In the absence of synergist, the heavy compounds in step 1 oil and light compounds in step 2 oils were observed. The presence of antimony bromide was confirmed in the step 1 oils but not in step 2 oils.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (high-impact polystyrene mixed with polyolefins) with measurable product yields, bromine distribution analysis, and detailed product characterization using GC-ECD."
"Kinetic model of the pyrolysis of polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor A kinetic study of the pyrolysis of polyethylene (HDPE) in a fluidized sand bed reactor was carried out. The HDPE particles were discharged onto the fluidized bed; in the upper part of the reactor, the volatiles evolved from primary reactions underwent secondary cracking reactions. A correlation model was applied to simulate the primary and secondary reactions, as well as the heat transfer process. The experimental yields of the total gases obtained in 41 runs performed at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900°C fitted satisfactorily with the proposed model. The values of the kinetic parameters of the secondary reactions and the heat transfer coefficient from the bed to the sample were optimized.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor with measured product yields at specific temperatures, demonstrating experimental data and analysis."
"Investigating waste valorization potential through the co-pyrolysis of waste activated sludge and polyethylene terephthalate: Analysis on thermal degradation behavior, kinetic properties and by-products Waste activated sludge (WAS) derived from food manufacturing poses critical environmental threats, necessitating sustainable management strategies. To address the challenges associated with the high moisture and ash contents of WAS, co-pyrolysis that incorporates polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a potential solution to transform WAS into value-added bio-products. In this study, the synergistic interactions between WAS and PET during co-pyrolysis were evaluated in terms of their thermal degradation behaviors, kinetics, and evolved volatiles at different blending ratios (3:1, 1:1, 1:3). The results revealed that the addition of PET synergistically enhanced the WAS decomposition, while the degradation of PET was inhibited at a high WAS fraction. Kinetic analysis further confirmed the interactions between WAS and PET, as the activation energies became higher than the additive values when the process reached the main degradation region of PET. The favorability of co-pyrolysis was proven by the less complicated reaction models that govern the kinetics of the blends, as well as the small difference between the values of activation energy and enthalpy change (4–6 kJ/mol). Evolved gas analysis revealed that co-pyrolysis of WAS and PET may undergo a greener alternative pathway to produce aromatic-rich bio-oil with much lower carbon dioxide emissions, as compared to pyrolysis of PET alone. These findings demonstrate the advantages of co-pyrolysis over the individual pyrolysis of WAS and PET, forming the theoretical basis for the upscaling of this technology and the effective valorization of hazardous wastes.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastic PET with waste activated sludge, with measurable product yields, kinetic analysis, and evolved gas characterization."
"Polyethylene conversion in supercritical water This paper describes pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) and n-hexadecane (nC16) in supercritical water (SCW). Batch reactions were conducted at temperatures ranging from 673 to 723K, at a reaction time of 30min, and water density between 0 and 0.42g/cm3. The pyrolysis rate of nC16 in SCW was almost the same as that in 0.1MPa argon (Ar) atmosphere. Product distribution was also more or less the same for both cases. PE pyrolysis results were clearly different from pyrolysis results in Ar. In SCW, higher yields of shorter chain hydrocarbons, higher 1-alkene/n-alkane ratio, and higher conversion were obtained. This difference of PE pyrolysis in SCW and in Ar could be explained by considering the difference in the reaction phase.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) in supercritical water with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of hydrocarbon distribution."
"Recovering carbon fibers from waste CFRPs via pyrolysis-oxidation method: Implications for reuse in remanufactured materials Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs) have gained widespread usage due to their promising physiochemical properties, while this causes large amounts of waste CFRPs worldwide. In this study, carbon fibers were successfully recovered from waste CFRPs through the pyrolysis-oxidation method, and the recovered fibers were reused in remanufacturing the secondary generation CFRPs. Moreover, the individual and interactive effects of pyrolysis-oxidation recovering parameters on the mechanical strength of the resulting remanufactured CFRPs (reCFRPs) were investigated. The recovered carbon fibers displayed surface chemical structures similar to virgin fibers but with high contents of oxygen-containing bonds. The tensile strength retention (TSR) of the reCFRPs was primarily influenced by oxidation temperature. Notably, a higher oxidation temperature, especially exceeding 560 °C, amplified the impact of oxidation duration on the TSR value. Similarly, concerning interlaminar shear strength retention (ISSR), the oxidation stage had a more substantial effect compared to the pyrolysis stage. As the oxidation temperature increased from 500 °C to 600 °C, the ISSR value initially increased and then decreased, irrespective of variations in pyrolysis parameters. Additionally, through integrating the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis and multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) global optimization, three recovery strategies, along with the corresponding processing parameters, were proposed to meet diverse requirements. The conclusions could provide valuable insights for optimizing the recovery and reuse of carbon fibers from waste CFRPs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis-oxidation of waste carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs), with measurable experimental data on temperature effects, product yields, and mechanical properties of recovered fibers."
"Thermal degradation of PMMA in fluidised beds In recent years, the production and consumption of plastics have increased significantly and wastes are commonly incinerated or dumped in a landfill. Plastics pyrolysis, on the other hand, may provide an alternative means for disposal of plastic wastes with recovery of valuable gasoline-range hydrocarbons or the monomer. Pyrolysis of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) may result in very high recycling rates (90–98%) of the monomer methylmethacrylate (MMA) since the cracking of MMA to lighter molecules (CO2, CO and light hydrocarbons) is limited. The MMA-yield is mainly dependent on the residence time of the gas in the reactor and to a lesser extent on the operating temperature. The paper presents experimental work performed in a lead bath and in a fluidised bed. At low temperatures, the reaction is kinetically controlled, whereas at high temperatures, heat transfer restricts the overall reaction rate. It was demonstrated that the heat transfer in the fluid bed could be estimated by the equation of Kothari. A design procedure for a fluid bed PMMA-depolymerisation reactor is outlined and illustrated for a process of 1 tpd PMMA.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of PMMA, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields and reactor conditions reported."
"An experimental investigation in a CI engine for the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of liquid fuel produced through catalytic co-pyrolysis The current study deals with blending pure diesel with the liquid fuel (PB1) obtained through the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Azadirachta indica seeds and waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) as the catalyst. The maximum yield of liquid oil was obtained at 500 °C at 93.91 % while at this temperature, the yield of gases and char were observed to be the lowest compared to other temperatures. The obtained liquid oil was then characterised through FTIR and physical properties were determined for the obtained fuel and it was found that PB1 contained a higher calorific value of 44.42 MJ/kg, quite close to pure diesel. Three blends were prepared with D100 (pure diesel), namely PB1@10 (with 10 % blend), PB1@20 (with 20 % blend) and PB1@30 (30 % blend). The blends were then tested in an unmodified CI engine for a comparative analysis with respect to baseline fuel (D100). BTE for PB1@20 was found to be 28.69 % at the highest load, maximum among blends and close enough to D100. BSFC was almost the same at 0.3 kg/kWh with PB1@20 and PB1@30 as that of D100 while the NOx formation decreased by 3.5 % at higher loads for PB1@30. The smoke formation also decreased for all blends at the higher loads, 43 % at 60 % load and 19.6 % at 80 % load, while the lambda factor also decreased substantially compared to D100 to be close to 1 at higher loads. The maximum cylinder pressure and maximum heat release during combustion also increased by approximately 1 % for PB1@20 and PB1@30 while PB1@10 remained quite close to D100. PB1@20 and PB1@30 were also found to have more heat release than D100, confirming a proper combustion with similar pattern as that of D100. The investigation revealed that the obtained renewable liquid oil from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Azadirachta indica seeds and waste LDPE using AL2O3 catalyst could be a potent fuel to be utilized at high blends with pure diesel.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste LDPE, a commercial plastic, with experimental data on product yields, fuel characterization, and engine performance testing."
"Aromatization-free strategy for sustainable aviation fuel: Co-upcycling waste oils and polystyrene plastics into alkanes and aromatics Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising solution for reducing aviation-related carbon emissions. However, conventional SAF production methods such as waste oil aromatization face challenges like complex processing requirements and the generation of unwanted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study presents a novel, aromatization-free approach to SAF production by co-upcycling waste oils and polystyrene (PS) plastics. The inherent aromatic ring structures in PS plastics are utilized to directly form aromatic hydrocarbons, bypassing the need for traditional aromatization. A two-stage pressurized fixed-bed reactor was employed, where waste oils and PS underwent co-hydropyrolysis to generate intermediates, followed by gas-phase catalytic hydrogenation. Under optimized conditions (0.15 MPa H2, 480 °C for co-hydropyrolysis, 350 °C for hydrogenation, and 5 mg Pd/SBA-15 catalyst), this process yielded 71.0 wt% C8-C16 jet fuel components, with 84.5 % selectivity. In comparison, catalysts with higher acidity, such as Pd/HZSM-5 and Pd/USY, promoted side reactions like cracking, leading to lower liquid yields (35.7 wt% and 18.1 wt%, respectively) and a more complex product mixture. Additionally, Pd/SBA-15 catalyst demonstrated excellent stability, maintaining consistent catalytic performance over 10 repeated cycles, and showed potential for scalability with a variety of waste plastics and oils. The study underscores the feasibility of co-upcycling waste oils and PS plastics, offering an efficient, sustainable pathway to streamline SAF production while reducing the environmental impacts associated with conventional methods.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on polystyrene plastic and waste oils, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of polymethyl methacrylate with brown coal and effect on monomer production Pyrolysis capillary gas chromatography has been applied to the study of the co-pyrolysis of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with Slovakian brown coal with the aim of finding pyrolysis conditions yielding a maximum amount of methyl methacrylate (MMA). Effects of pyrolysis temperature and PMMA–coal weight ratios were investigated. Capillary gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detector (cGC-MS) was used for MMA identification. The highest yield of MMA in the pyrolysate was obtained at 750°C. The optimal PMMA–coal weight ratio for maximum MMA production lies in the interval 0.5mg PMMA and 0.6–0.8mg brown coal with an MMA yield of 64%. Coal addition to the sample affects species recombination in gaseous phase, augments MMA production at higher temperatures and eliminates degradation products of PMMA and coal pyrolysis. Different conversion diagrams are characteristic for thermal degradation of single PMMA and in the mixture with coal. Detailed mechanism of synergetic effects arisen during co-pyrolysis are not yet known. It was also found that lower pyrolysis temperatures are more suitable to study degradation mechanism and kinetics while higher temperatures are more applicable for identification purposes. MMA decomposes completely at 900°C.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic PMMA with brown coal, reports measurable product yields (MMA at 64% at 750°C), and includes experimental characterization via cGC-MS and temperature-dependent yield analysis."
"Slow pyrolysis of waste polyethylene terephthalate yielding paraldehyde, ethylene glycol, benzoic acid and clean fuel The low-temperature slow pyrolysis of PET waste was studied. After intensive thermal activation, the waste PET could be completely pyrolyzed at 25 °C min−1 to the final temperature of 400 °C. The main components of the resulting oil were paraldehyde (54.7 wt.%) and ethylene glycol (23.7 wt.%); further, benzoic acid and benzoates were obtained. Such products represent valuable intermediates for industrial use or other applications. In addition, the pyrolysis produced a solid carbonaceous residue, particularly usable as a low-ash and low-sulfur smokeless fuel (HHV 31.3, LHV 30.4 MJ kg−1). Thus, the low-temperature pyrolysis of PET waste yields products that are easy to put to use with no demands on the purity of the feedstock.","The study involves lab-scale slow pyrolysis of waste PET plastic, with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Influence of process conditions on syngas production from the thermal processing of waste high density polyethylene A range of process conditions, including the type of reactor, the reacting atmosphere and the presence of catalyst, and their influence on the production of syngas, i.e. hydrogen and carbon monoxide, from the thermal processing of waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated. Pyrolysis in the presence of nitrogen and in the presence of carbon dioxide, two-stage pyrolysis-steam reforming and carbon dioxide/catalysis process conditions were investigated in relation to gas composition and particularly hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield. The influence of addition of a Ni–Mg–Al catalyst in the second reactor was also investigated. It was found that a two-stage pyrolysis at 500°C, followed by second stage reaction at 800°C resulted in a significant increase in hydrogen production. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the two stage process also increased carbon monoxide yield in addition to hydrogen. Addition of steam into the second stage reactor with the carbon dioxide produced a further increase in hydrogen production. Also, the presence of a Ni–Mg–Al catalyst in the second reactor increased the amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced.","The study investigates pyrolysis of waste HDPE with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and catalyst performance, including experimental data on syngas composition and yield under varying process conditions."
"Identification of the coke deposited on an HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst during the sequenced pyrolysis–cracking of HDPE The pyrolysis–cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been studied in two sequenced steps: (1) flash pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed reactor, and (2) catalytic cracking of the volatiles (waxes) in a fixed bed reactor containing a HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst, aiming light olefins as final products. The pyrolysis and cracking have been carried out isothermally at 500°C, with a continuous feed of HDPE (1gmin−1) for up to 5h (300g of HDPE fed). We have correlated the catalytic deactivation by coke (carbonaceous deposits), in terms of amount and composition, with the profiles of gas composition along time on stream and space time. The amount and composition of coke in three axial positions of the catalytic bed have been elucidated using thermogravimetric (TG-TPO) and spectroscopic techniques (13C CP-MAS NMR, Raman, FTIR, FTIR-TPO-MS and FTIR-pyridine). Our results show that there are two pathways of coke formation: (i) initiation, during the first hour on stream and particularly in the inlet of the catalytic reactor; and (ii) steady coke formation, after the first hour on stream which is more severe in the last axial position of the catalytic reactor. The initiation step stems from the degradation of the waxes produced in the pyrolysis of HDPE and causes a dropping in the mesopore area of the catalyst. The steady coke formation step is caused by the condensation of light olefins and causes the degradation of the micropore area and the Brønsted acidity of the catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor followed by catalytic cracking in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, coke characterization, and detailed analytical data."
"Ultrapyrolytic cracking of polyethylene — a high yield recycling method Intrinsic chemical kinetics for the ultrapyrolysis of waste plastics are needed to assess the feasibility for this technology of processing if it is to be used for tertiary recycling. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of various operating factors for the pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a common polymer found in plastic wastes, and determine viable operating conditions for maximizing the production of high value products such as ethylene, propylene, butadiene. Experiments were performed using both a batch micro-reactor and pilot plant sized reactor. The key operating factors considered were temperature and reaction time, with the reaction systems operated under isothermal conditions. In the micro-reactor experiments, LDPE was pyrolyzed at temperatures of 800°C and 900°C, with total reaction times ranging from 350 to 2500 milliseconds. Experiments completed with the pilot plant also produced excellent results with light olefin production reaching 75 wt% at 800°C.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using batch micro-reactor and pilot plant reactors, with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships reported."
"Pyrolysis and combustion of PVC, PVC-wood and PVC-coal mixtures in a two-stage fluidized bed process Several tests using pure bottle-grade polyvinyl chlorine (PVC), with wood (pine) and with Polish coal have been performed in a two-stage combustion test facility which contains two reactors. The first reactor is a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) where the fuel is pyrolysed in the temperature range 200–400 °C. The second reactor is a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) operated at a temperature of around 800 °C. The pyrolysed gases from the BFB reactor or the circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC) are analysed with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The main part of this work concentrates on the first stage of decomposition of PVC in the first reactor, which mainly yields volatiles (mainly HCl) and solid residue. The results show that there is an interaction in PVC/wood pine mixtures, which affects the degradation of PVC. The same interaction also occurred with the PVC/Polish coal mixture. For the two-stage combustion test, the chemical analysis of char samples taken from the bed of the first reactor, when 100% PVC is used, shows that the chlorine content is below 0.1 wt.% at chlorine to carbon mass ratio<0.001 kg Cl/kg C.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) in a two-stage fluidized bed reactor with measurable product analysis, temperature control, and characterization of char and gases."
"Valorizing disposable face masks into non-condensable hydrocarbon gases via optimal reactor configurations in thermal pyrolysis Pyrolysis studies often overlook the potential of pyrolytic gas as a valuable hydrocarbon resource, thereby hindering the production of advanced carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNM). This study aims to explore various configurations of a multi-zone tubular reactor to upcycle disposable face masks into non-condensable hydrocarbons as potential CNM precursors. The highest gas yield (56.2 wt%) was achieved using a 3-zone configuration (Z-1,3,4), attributed to the end chain scission mechanism. The increased abundance of light hydrocarbons (≤C10) in the resulting liquid confirms a greater extent of end chain scission in the optimum reactor configuration with cold zone retainment. Employing this configuration, different face mask types, including 3ply (polypropylene-based), KF94 (polypropylene-based) and N95 (polyester-based), were utilized as individual feedstocks or in various ratios as mixtures to investigate the resultant composition of hydrocarbon gases. This composition was compared with existing literature studies to identify suitable hydrocarbon gas compositions for CNM production. Mixing 3ply and KF94 face masks produced a consistent gas composition predominantly comprising propylene (62.3 – 66.9%) and ethane (15.4 – 16.8%) via thermal pyrolysis at 500 ℃ with a constant heating rate of 20 ℃/min. However, the inclusion of N95 face masks increased CO2 level fivefold, diminishing the gas quality as a CNM precursor. These findings underscore the necessity of segregating polyester face mask material from polypropylene face mask material prior to pyrolysis to ensure a consistent quality and yield of CNM precursors.","The study involves thermal pyrolysis of waste plastic face masks (polypropylene and polyester) with measurable yields, reactor configurations, and product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis characteristics and kinetic analysis of organic food waste and plastic In this work, typical organic food waste (soybean protein (SP)) and typical chlorine enriched plastic waste (polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) were chosen as principal MSW components and their interaction during co-pyrolysis was investigated. Results indicate that the interaction accelerated the reaction during co-pyrolysis. The activation energies needed were 2–13% lower for the decomposition of mixture compared with linear calculation while the maximum reaction rates were 12–16% higher than calculation. In the fixed-bed experiments, interaction was observed to reduce the yield of tar by 2–69% and promote the yield of char by 13–39% compared with linear calculation. In addition, 2–6 times more heavy components and 61–93% less nitrogen-containing components were formed for tar derived from mixtures.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of plastic waste (PVC) and organic food waste, with measurable product yields, kinetic analysis, and detailed characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Insights into the development of greener mild zeolite dealumination routes applied to the hydrocracking of waste plastics This study highlights novel, energy-efficient, environmentally friendly and less time-consuming methods to dealuminate zeolites, by forced convective steaming and use of molecular CO2. Zeolites with comparable (or superior) physicochemical properties than those of traditional dealumination techniques were produced. All dealuminated zeolites were tested for the hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene, showing considerably high activity and selectivity for lighter oils, particularly gasoline. The forced convective steamed zeolite revealed to be the best, given its high number of silanol groups, acidity and porosity, and lower environmental impact. Furthermore, bi-functional Ni-loaded dealuminated zeolites showed good stability and ability to be regenerated. Therefore, it is possible to generate hierarchical zeolites by dealumination with physicochemical and catalytic properties comparable to their rival technologies, following green chemistry metrics. Given the relevance of hierarchical zeolites in sustainable routes to produce chemicals and fuels, the potential of application of these newly developed catalysts is highly promising and vast.","The study involves lab-scale experimental hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene (a waste plastic) using novel dealuminated zeolite catalysts, with measurable results including catalyst performance, product selectivity for lighter oils, and catalytic activity."
"Thermocatalytic degradation of common polymers: A microscale combustion calorimetry study This paper presents the first application of the microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) to study catalyzed pyrolysis of the practical polymers comprising most of currently produced plastic wastes. The polymers considered include olefines (HDPE, LDPE, and PP), PS, PMMA, PET, PC, and PVC. Each of the polymers is mixed with one of the two catalysts, ZSM-5 or MgO, and the measurements are undertaken for the catalyst mass fractions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 at several heating rates ranging from 15 to 60 K/min. Strong catalytic effect of ZSM-5 has been demonstrated for the polyolefin polymers (HDPE, LDPE, and PP). Such effect manifests itself in a significant reduction of characteristic pyrolysis temperatures and apparent activation energy; the latter is shown to decrease greatly (by a factor of about two) when the catalyst is added. As the catalyst mass fraction increases up to 0.1 (0.2 for LDPE + ZSM-5 mixture), the saturation is attained, and further addition of the catalyst has no effect. The heat of combustion of pyrolysis volatiles does not reveal a definitive dependence on the catalyst mass fraction, while in some cases the width of pyrolysis temperature interval as well as the char yield are affected. Decomposition of the remaining polymers in presence of ZSM-5 or MgO is either catalyzed rather weakly or even inhibited such as that in PS + ZSM-5 mixture. Among the polymers examined, PC turns out to be the only polymer that is considerably catalyzed by MgO. For the mixtures in which significant catalytic effect was detected, the formal kinetic models have been derived from the microscale measurements and shown to replicate the MCC data at different heating rates. These polymers, both individually and mixed with the catalyst, are often characterized by the non-monotonic conversion function which cannot be approximated by the n-th order reaction model.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of common waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PMMA, PET, PC, PVC) with catalysts, measuring yields, temperatures, activation energies, and product characteristics using microscale combustion calorimetry."
"Valorisation of waste biomass and plastics toward light aromatics: Co-catalytic fast pyrolysis of torrefied bamboo and polyethylene over alkali and acid treated hierarchical HZSM-5 Light aromatics are extremely important building blocks which can be prepared from the co-catalytic fast pyrolysis (Co-CFP) of biomass and polyethylene. In this study, the bamboo was torrefied to remove part of oxygen element prior to pyrolysis, then being co-fed with polyethylene (HDPE, PE and LDPE) during CFP over alkali (NaOH and Na2CO3) and acid (H3PO4 and HCl) treated HZSM-5. 40.3% oxygen element in bamboo could be eliminated at torrefaction temperature of 300 °C. After the acid dealumination or alkali desilication treatments, the mesopore was creased in HZSM-5, transforming into hierarchical structure with larger pore size and lower acidity. The effect of torrefaction temperature, the species of alkali or acid solutions and their concentrations, the mass ratio of HDPE-to-torrefied bamboo, the CFP temperature on the yields of light aromatics was systematically discussed. The maximum yield of BTX was 4.39 × 108 a.u./mg which was obtained by Co-CFP of torrefied bamboo (250 °C) and HDPE at mass ratio of 1:2 with 800 °C over 0.2 M NaOH treated hierarchical HZSM-5. The aromatization reaction of olefins, the deoxygenation reaction of oxygenates, and the Diels-Alder reaction between furans and olefins were key reactions for the formation of BTX during Co-CFP of torrefied bamboo and polyethylene.","The study involves lab-scale co-catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (HDPE, PE, LDPE) with torrefied bamboo, including measured product yields, reactor conditions, catalyst treatments, and analytical characterization."
"Elucidating the structure-performance relationship of typical commercial zeolites in catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene Zeolite exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins, but the reaction results are often controversial due to the differences in the lab-scale synthesized zeolites and the types of reactors selected. In this work, in order to eliminate the differences of catalysts synthesized by individual researchers, we studied the catalytic performance of four typical commercial zeolites (HZSM-5, Hβ, HY and SAPO-11) in the cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) by self-designed batch reactor. By comparing the reaction performance of four zeolites under the same condition and correlating with the pore structure and acidity of the zeolites, it was found that the acid strength of zeolites was positively correlated with the cracking conversion. HZSM-5 and Hβ zeolites with high acid strength achieved a LDPE conversion of above 94%. Large micropore is beneficial to the formation of isomerized products, but promotes the formation of coke precursors, resulting in serious coking. By analyzing the product distribution over different zeolites, it was observed that Hβ achieved the highest yield of gasoline components. HZSM-5 and HY exhibited high yields of aromatization products. The high aromatization activity of HZSM-5 was attributed to its strong acidity which enhanced the hydrogen transfer process, while HY possesses high concentrations of both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites, and the synergistic effect of these two acid sites promotes the aromatization process.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using commercial zeolites, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Synthesis of polypropylene waste-derived graphene sheets in the presence of metal oxide nanoparticles Graphene nanosheets (GNSs) derived from polypropylene (PP) plastic waste were deposited over Cr2O3, CuO, and NiO nanoparticles as unsupported catalysts in an innovative study. For each catalyst, a specific graphene deposition route was indicated along with the features of the active species and their function. The unsupported catalysts were prepared using a simple combustion method. A simple two-step method was used to synthesize graphene sheets over metal oxide nanoparticles via pyrolysis of waste PP. Several analytical techniques, including XRD, TPR, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, were used to characterize the nanoparticles before and after graphene deposition. The results indicated that Cr2O3 produced more graphene than NiO and CuO, despite its poor reducibility and weak catalytic decomposition character towards the inlet gaseous hydrocarbons. An exceptional graphene deposition route over Cr2O3 was assumed, which was based on the dehydrogenation and aromatization procedure for the inlet hydrocarbons, as well as the function of Cr2O3 redox species. The results revealed a difference in graphene deposition behavior between redox-active species of Cr2O3 and metallic Ni and Cu, which were generated from NiO and CuO. Several graphene morphologies were produced according to the type of catalyst used during the production process.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste polypropylene plastic with measurable product formation (graphene nanosheets) and experimental characterization using XRD, TEM, Raman, and TPR, indicating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"Hydrocarbon fuels produced by catalytic pyrolysis of hospital plastic wastes in a fluidizing cracking process A mixture of post-consumer polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrene (PE/PP/PS) with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waste was pyrolyzed over cracking catalysts using a fluidizing reaction system operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The influences of catalyst types and reaction conditions including reaction temperatures, ratios of catalyst to plastic feed, flow rates of fluidizing gas and catalyst particle sizes were examined. Experiments carried out with various catalysts gave good yields of valuable hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions. A model based on kinetic and mechanistic considerations associated with chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation in the acid-catalyzed degradation of plastics has been developed. The model gives a good representation of experimental results from the degradation of commingled plastic waste. The results of this study are useful for determining the effects of catalyst types and reaction conditions on both the product distribution and selectivity from hospital plastic waste, and especially for the utilization of post-use commercial FCC catalysts for producing valuable hydrocarbons in a fluidizing cracking process.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste (PE/PP/PS/PVC) in a fluidized reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product selectivity under varying conditions."
"Slow pyrolysis of low-density Poly-Ethylene (LDPE): A batch experiment and thermodynamic analysis This research investigates the catalytic effect of activated charcoal, MgCO3, and ZSM-5 in a batch-pyrolysis reactor with a Low-Density Poly-Ethylene (LDPE) feedstock on pyro-oil yield. Initially, trials with the ZSM-5 catalyst were conducted at various temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 °C, in which 500 °C temperature offered a higher pyro-oil yield. Further, similar experiments were carried out with activated charcoal and MgCO3 at 500 °C. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of pyro-oil was done using GC/MS, DSC, TGA, and FTIR techniques. In GC/MS and FTIR, the range of hydrocarbon lying in C5 – C35 for aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic groups. Moreover, the thermal stability of pyro-oil is found to be 350 °C and decreased by 10%–450 °C from TGA studies. The elemental analysis of char (C90.08% H9.82% N0.10%) and gas composition of pyro-gas were also studied. Additionally, thermal calculations were done for mass balance, energy balance, and exergy balance at various temperatures and found to be in good agreement with the input and output parameters. As per findings, the pyrolysis studies at 500 °C with LDPE feedstock and ZSM-5 catalyst showed higher pyro-oil yields than other tested catalysts under similar conditions.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of LDPE plastic with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis, and experimental characterization techniques."
"Cleaner production of aviation oil from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic wastes Large amounts of plastic wastes are generated due to the wide applications. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis for the production of aviation oil is a cleaner method to achieve the recycle of plastic waste. The study focuses on microwave-assisted pyrolysis of five kinds of plastic wastes (polypropylene, polystyrene, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polycarbonate) for cleaner aviation oil production. In this study, the heating performance, product yield, product component, and pyrolysis mechanism of five kinds of plastic wastes through performing microwave-assisted pyrolysis were systematically explored and visually compared, so as to highlight the advantages and disadvantages about the conversion of different kinds of plastic wastes into aviation oil. It was concluded that polystyrene showed the lowest average heating rates of 60 °C/min and highest aviation oil yield of 98.78 wt% among the five plastic wastes, and the highest aviation oil yield was occurred at the microwave power of 650 W, microwave absorbent load of 60 g, and pyrolysis temperature of 460 °C. Polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene preferred to aliphatic hydrocarbons (99.33 area%, 98.45 area%, and 100 area%, respectively) mainly through random chain scission, recombination, and addition. Polystyrene preferred to aromatic hydrocarbons (73.39 area%) through β-scission, random chain scission, and intermolecular hydrogen transfer, whereas polycarbonate preferred to phenols (87.73 area%) mainly through decarboxylation and dihydroxylation. The majority of C8-16 hydrocarbons in aviation oil from polypropylene, polystyrene, high-density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene were 91.02 area%, 64.79 area%, 77.52 area%, and 59.73 area%, respectively. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste can not only effectively solve the environmental problem, but also contribute to value-added products, showing a very good cleaner production method.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of specific waste plastics (PP, PS, HDPE, LDPE, PC) with measurable product yields, optimal conditions, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Binary mixture pyrolysis of polystyrene and poly(α-methylstyrene) The batch pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) in the presence of poly(α-methylstyrene) (PAMS) was investigated to determine the effect of the second polymer on the decomposition of polystyrene. Experimental parameters that were varied included the molecular weight and the concentration of each polymeric reactant. It was observed that the decomposition of polystyrene was dependent on the molecular weight of poly(α-methylstyrene). An enhancement in the polystyrene degradation rate was achieved during binary mixture pyrolysis of low molecular weight polymers, but a rate inhibition was observed during degradation in the presence of higher molecular weight PAMS. It is proposed that the divergence arises from differences in the relative magnitude of the enhancement caused by the production of PAMS-derived radicals and the inhibition due to incorporation of α-methylstyrene monomer into depolymerizing polystyrene chains. Variations in the initial concentration of the reactants had little effect on the yields of polystyrene degradation products.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics (PS and PAMS) with measurable product yields and temperature-dependent degradation rates, including experimental characterization of decomposition behavior."
"Hydrogen and aromatics recovery through plasma-catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene Plasma-catalysis pyrolysis is a promising way to solve the problem of catalyst deactivation during plastic recycling. In this study, pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) over zeolite ZSM-5 has been carried out in a two-stage fixed bed pyrolysis system with a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. The role of plasma on the pyrolysis process, as well as the stability of the plasma-catalytic system was investigated. Compared to conventional catalytic pyrolysis, plasma-catalysis pyrolysis increased gas products from 29 wt% to 47 wt% with 4.19 mmol/g H2 formed, and improved the selectivity of BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) whilst inhibiting the production of wax simultaneously. After 10 cycles, clear decreases in gas and oil yield (from 86 wt% to 48 wt%) and BTX selectivity (from 71 wt% to 39 wt%) were found in the conventional catalytic pyrolysis, however, nearly no variation was shown in the plasma-catalysis mode. The coupling of catalyst and plasma modified the catalysts acidic sites, while the radicals enhanced the pre-cracking of volatiles, resulting in less deposited coke. Overall, the introduction of plasma resulted in an obvious reduction in total costs and presented a feasible strategy for the recycling of waste plastic.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste polypropylene with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical data on gas, oil, BTX selectivity, and coke formation."
"High-efficient microwave plasma discharging initiated conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes Large-scale manufacture and discard of plastics cause ever serious white pollution. Chemical recycling has been identified as a promising method to convert waste plastics into fuels and chemical products. In this work, a simple and high-efficient method initiated by microwave plasma discharging is proposed to decompose plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes, wherein iron-based catalysts are used as the microwave susceptor and metal tips are utilized to induce plasma discharging. Iron-based catalysts supported on activated carbons calcinated at 400 °C have displayed the best catalytic activity due to the excellent physicochemical properties. Massive H2 rapidly evolves out in the 25 s with a hydrogen efficiency of over 85%. The yield of H2 with plasma discharging by using Fe/AC-400 catalyst is near 300 mmol·g-1Hplastic, which exhibits a 6 times improvement compared to 41 mmol·g-1Hplastic without plasma discharging by using AC catalyst. Little other gases including CH4, CO and CO2 are detected while high-value carbon nanotubes are fabricated. The continuity test over Fe/AC-400 catalyst with microwave plasma discharging presents the distinct ability to generate CNTs continuously. The decomposition for three kinds of plastics has demonstrated the extremely high universal and potential in practical application for real-world plastic wastes.","The study involves microwave plasma-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, etc.) with measurable hydrogen yield (300 mmol·g⁻¹), carbon nanotube production, catalyst performance, and reactor conditions, confirming lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"Influence of Fe based ZSM-5 catalysts on the vapor intermediates from the pyrolysis of brominated acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (Br-ABS) The catalytic upgrading of the vapor intermediates from the pyrolysis of brominated acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (Br-ABS) was investigated over the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Results showed that HZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited high catalytic cracking activities, resulting in the increased yield of oil from 62.8 wt% to 64.3 wt% and 66.7 wt%, respectively. When the higher amounts of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were applied, the oil yield decreased to 59–61.6 wt%, whereas high amounts of coke were deposited on the catalysts. On the other hand, the higher percentages of the single ring and 2 ring aromatic compounds in the oils was obtained by the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, compared to the thermal pyrolysis and the catalytic upgrading by the parent HZSM-5 catalyst. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts significantly promoted the formation of styrene monomer and dimer derivatives. It could be proposed that the Fe based materials was in favor of the depolymerization of the polymer matrix, providing the styrene sources for the secondary oligomerization over the parent HZSM-5 catalyst. In addition, the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited effective debromination performance, by means of cracking the organobromine compounds and capturing the inorganic bromine in the catalyst. The possible catalytic cracking mechanism over the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst was discussed.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic Br-ABS using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Enhancing bioenergy Efficiency: Microwave-Assisted Co-pyrolysis of plastic and sludge waste with catalytic upgrading The growing accumulation of plastic and sewage sludge (SS) waste necessitates effective and sustainable valorization technologies. This study presents a novel integration of microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and SS, offering a dual solution for waste reduction and bioenergy recovery. The research uniquely combines synergistic feedstock interaction, catalyst performance and comprehensive energy analysis within a microwave-driven system, an area seldom explored in previous literature. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, PET/SS feedstock ratio and catalyst type (HZSM-5 and KOH) were systematically investigated. HZSM-5 significantly enhanced bio-oil yield (up to 49.5 wt%) and bioenergy density (31.88 MJ/kg), while KOH promoted higher biochar yield (up to 70.05 wt%) with improved fuel stability. Catalyst addition also influenced product composition, increasing valuable compounds like ketones and aromatic hydrocarbons while modulating biogas profiles (CO and CO2). GC-MS and GC-TCD analyses validated the compositional changes. The study demonstrated bioenergy extraction efficiencies ranging from 36.74 % to 92.50 %, although overall process energy efficiency remained lower due to energy losses at the lab scale. Nonetheless, catalysts induce lower reliance on operating temperature, enabling lower-temperature operation and indicating potential energy savings in scaled-up systems. The use of microwave energy also offers rapid, selective heating with reduced startup times, which is advantageous for continuous industrial processes. This work highlights the added value of catalyst, microwave synergy for improving energy yields and product quality from heterogeneous waste. The insights gained provide a critical foundation for designing scalable, efficient microwave pyrolysis systems and advancing waste-to-energy technologies in support of a circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of PET plastic and sewage sludge, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of bio-oil and biogas composition."
"Stability of ZSM-11 and BETA zeolites during the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene The stability of H-ZSM-11 (H-Z) and H-BETA (H-B) zeolites during the catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied using the same sample of catalyst in eleven consecutive cycles. The gaseous hydrocarbons, liquid hydrocarbons and waxes generated in each cycle were analyzed as well as the used catalyst. The zeolites were characterized by XRD, FTIR of adsorbed pyridine and N2 adsorption, while the physical mixtures of LDPE/zeolites were subjected to TG-DTG analysis.The H-Z zeolite exhibited an important stability during the successive cycles of LDPE conversion. On the contrary, the behavior H-B zeolite was completely different; from the sixth cycle the yields of products changed progressively, approaching to that obtained in a purely thermal process. The yields of accumulated coke increased steadily throughout the cycles up to maximum values in the eleventh cycle of ∼6 and ∼15wt% for H-Z and H-B, respectively. These results were confirmed by TG under air flow.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst stability over cycles, and experimental characterization including XRD, FTIR, and TG-DTG."
"Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and polystyrene with ex-situ catalytic bed of metal oxides/HZSM-5 with focus on liquid yield Catalytic co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and polystyrene (PS) was conducted in a fixed bed reactor over microporous HZSM-5, mesoporous metal oxides (MgO, CaO) and their blends to examine the effect on pyrolytic liquid yields and quality. Though the catalyst addition decreased the liquid yield, improvement in mono-aromatic hydrocarbon yield with the least content of oxygenates was achieved in the catalytic trials. Results revealed that HZSM-5 showed maximum conversion efficiency of acids, furans and phenols acting as hydrocarbon source for aromatic production. Basic MgO, with acidic HZSM-5, was found to conduce better catalytic performance yielding improved oil quality compared to HZSM-5:CaO catalyst. Mass ratio of 1:3 HZSM-5:MgO exhibited most eminent synergistic effect with maximum (56.8 wt%) mono-aromatic hydrocarbon (MAH) yield and lowest (20.8 wt%) poly-aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. Additionally, increased calorific value and density upgradation comparable to standard diesel fuel quality were observed in the presence of dual catalyst layout.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of polystyrene and sugarcane bagasse with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and fuel quality data including mono-aromatic hydrocarbon yield and calorific value."
"Thermodynamic investigation and 4Es analysis of a VCR diesel engine using emulsified diesel with catalytic co-pyrolysis fuel derived from waste LDPE and Pongamia pinnata seeds Global challenges for massive plastic waste disposal and regular decrement of conventional resources, converting plastic and biomass seeds waste into transportation-grade fuels through co-pyrolysis offer a better option for providing a promising solution. This investigation signifies a thermodynamic power cycle model, and 4Es (Energy, Exergy, Environmental, Economic) analysis of a direct injection unmodified diesel engine powered with various blends of test fuels derived from thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) wastes and Pongamia pinnata seeds at 500 °C with calcium oxide as catalyst, mixed with diesel. The fuel mixtures of pure diesel and pyrolytic test fuels are utilized for diesel engine testing with varying compression ratio. The synergistic effects of major parameters such as full engine load, varying compression ratios (16:1, 17:1, 18:1, and 19:1), and fuel blends (10, 20, 30, and 40 %) are considered for engine run. The Brake thermal energy was found to increase for the 20 % blend at 6.6 % (40 % load) in comparison to pure diesel. Also, the Brake specific fuel consumption was the least for the same blend, 0.31 kg/kWh at 18:1 CR. The smoke was also found to have lowered by 22 % for the 20 % blend in comparison to pure diesel. At a compression ratio of 18:1, the NOx formation also decreased by approximately 1.4 % in comparison to the pure diesel for almost all considered fuel blends. The fuel efficiency was observed to increase for the 20 % blend compared to pure diesel by 20 %. The cost and exergy destruction analysis also confirmed the D80PB20 to have the least and maximum values respectively for both parameters. The energy, exergy, emission, and economic (4Es) analysis confirmed the suitability of blended fuels for achieving improved engine performance and emissions. In addition, the economic and fuel sustainability analysis foster the techno-economic feasibility of the test fuels as compared to conventional diesel fuel.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste LDPE and Pongamia pinnata seeds, with measurable product yields, engine performance data, and analytical characterization of fuels derived from the process."
"Defossilization and decarbonization of hydrogen production using plastic waste: Temperature and feedstock effects during thermolysis stage The replacement of natural gas with plastic-derived pyrolysis gas can defossilize H2 production, while subsequent capture, utilization and storage of carbon in a solid form can decarbonize the process. The objective of this study was to investigate H2 production from three types of plastics using a process comprising pyrolysis (600 °C) and thermolysis stages (1200–1500 °C). Depending on the plastic feedstock and thermolysis temperature, the laboratory-scale setup generated 1000–1350 mL/min product gas with H2 purity of 74.3–94.2 vol%. The recovery of 5–9 wt% molecular H2 per mass of plastics was achieved. Other products included solid residue (0.1–12 wt%) and oil (8–52 wt%) from the pyrolysis reactor, solid carbon (36–53 wt%) and gas impurities (2–16 wt%) from the thermolysis reactor. The purity of H2 gas was detrimentally influenced by polyethylene terephthalate in the feedstock due to the dilution of gas by CO. The decomposition of methane containing in the pyrolysis gas was the limiting reaction step during H2 production and improved at higher thermolysis temperature. Three solid carbon structures were formed during the thermolysis stage regardless of the plastic type: carbon black aggregates, carbon black aggregates coated with a layer of pyrolytic carbon and a carbon film on the inner reactor wall. Among the three types of carbon, the highest valorization potential was identified for carbon black aggregates. Plastic feedstock composition had little if any effect on carbon black properties, while high thermolysis temperature (1500 °C) reduced the particle sizes and increased the surface area of aggregates.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PET, etc.) with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products and solid carbon structures."
"Conversion of low-density polyethylene into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through continuous microwave pyrolysis with ex-situ dual-catalyst beds The single-use of polyolefins-based individual protective equipment has led to the rapid generation of substantial plastic waste. This study aimed at cleaner disposal of the polyolefin waste, and carried out the continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over dual-catalyst beds of MCM-41 and HY. The dual-catalyzed trial was able to produce more condensate fractions with higher selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), compared with using only MCM-41 or HY zeolite. It was because the larger pore size of the MCM-41 catalyst (4.00 nm) could crack long-chain polyolefin intermediates into shorter chains. This alleviates steric and diffusional resistance while entering and exiting the micropores of the HY zeolite (0.74 × 0.74 nm). The maximum liquid yield (63.75 wt%) and MAHs selectivity (78.21%) were achieved at a catalysis temperature of 450 °C, feedstock to catalyst ratio of 8:3, and HY to MCM-41 ratio of 2:1. In addition, the performance of the CMP reactor was also compared favorably with the batch microwave pyrolysis (BMP) reactor under the same conditions. It has been found that the CMP reactor generated more MAHs products, whereas the BMP reactor was more selective for the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and gas products. The combination of CMP and the co-catalysis process offers new insight into sustainable management and value-added recovery of medical plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale continuous microwave pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Dehydrohalogenation during pyrolysis of brominated flame retardant containing high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) mixed with polyvinylchloride (PVC) Dehydrohalogenation during pyrolysis of brominated flame retardant containing polystyrene (brominated high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br)) mixed with polyvinylchloride (PVC) was carried out in a laboratory scale batch process. Thermal and catalytic degradation of HIPS-Br mixed with PVC on carbon composite of iron oxide (TR-00301) catalyst was investigated. The thermal degradation of waste plastics (HIPS-Br/PVC) yielded liquid products with 55,000ppm bromine and 4300ppm chlorine content in oil. Catalytic degradation (4g; TR-00301) of HIPS-Br/PVC waste plastics at 430°C produced halogen-free clean oil, which can be used as a fuel oil or chemical feedstock. The main liquid products during catalytic degradation were benzene, toluene, styrene, ethyl benzene, α-methyl styrene, butyl benzene, 1,2-dimethyl benzene etc. The average carbon number of the liquid products produced during catalytic degradation (9.3) of waste plastics was less than that of the thermal degradation (10.4) and the density of liquid products was found to be lower during the catalytic degradation than the thermal degradation. The possibility of a single step catalytic process for the conversion of halogenated waste plastics into fuel oil with the simultaneous removal of chlorine and bromine content from the oil was demonstrated.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HIPS-Br and PVC) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis of aseptic packages (tetrapak) in a laboratory screw type reactor and secondary thermal/catalytic tar decomposition Pyrolysis of aseptic packages (tetrapak cartons) in a laboratory apparatus using a flow screw type reactor and a secondary catalytic reactor for tar cracking was studied. The pyrolysis experiments were realized at temperatures ranging from 650°C to 850°C aimed at maximizing of the amount of the gas product and reducing its tar content. Distribution of tetrapak into the product yields at different conditions was obtained. The presence of H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and light hydrocarbons, HCx, in the gas product was observed. The Aluminum foil was easily separated from the solid product. The rest part of char was characterized by proximate and elemental analysis and calorimetric measurements. The total organic carbon in the tar product was estimated by elemental analysis of tars. Two types of catalysts (dolomite and red clay marked AFRC) were used for catalytic thermal tar decomposition. Three series of experiments (without catalyst in a secondary cracking reactor, with dolomite and with AFRC) at temperatures of 650, 700, 750, 800 and 850°C were carried out. Both types of catalysts have significantly affected the content of tars and other components in pyrolytic gases. The effect of catalyst on the tetrapack distribution into the product yield on the composition of gas and on the total organic carbon in the tar product is presented in this work.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste aseptic packages (tetrapak), a type of mixed plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of gases, tar, and char."
"Synergistic effects of Fe@C catalysts prepared at different carbonization temperatures on microwave co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic for high-value oil and gas production This study explores the impact of Fe@C catalysts, prepared at different carbonization temperatures, on the microwave co-pyrolysis of bamboo and polyethylene (BP) for the production of high-value oil and gas. In the synthesis of MIL-101(Fe), bamboo-derived pyrolytic carbon was added, and this was used as a precursor to synthesize Fe@C catalysts through microwave carbonization. Various properties and characteristics of Fe@C catalysts were analyzed using XRD, BET, SEM, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy to understand its structure and performance comprehensively. The composition of bio-oil, pyrolysis gas, and product distribution were analyzed. The results show that Fe@C catalysts enhances the yield of pyrolysis gas, as well as the selectivity of H2 in the pyrolysis gas and aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil. Among them, Fe@C-700 catalysts achieved the highest synthesis gas yield (89.35 vol%) and aromatic hydrocarbon yield (27.13 %). Additionally, the proportion of light aromatic hydrocarbons (BTX) in the aromatic hydrocarbon compounds can reach up to 31.33 %.

"Chemical recycling of post-consumer polymer waste over fluidizing cracking catalysts for producing chemicals and hydrocarbon fuels Mixture of polymer waste (LDPE/HDPE/PP) was pyrolyzed over various catalysts using a laboratory fluidized-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The systematic experiments discussed in this work show that the use of various catalysts improves the yield of hydrocarbon products and provides better selectivity in the product distributions. Typically, the yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolitic catalysts (ZSM-5>MOR>USY) gave higher yield than non-zeolitic catalysts (MCM-41>ASA). MCM-41 with large mesopores and ASA with weaker acid sites resulted in a highly olefinic product and gave a wide carbon number distribution, whereas USY yielded a saturate-rich product with a wide carbon number distribution and substantial coke levels. In addition, a model based on kinetic and mechanistic considerations associated with chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation for the catalytic degradation of commingled polymer waste has been developed. This model represents the benefits of product selectivity for the chemical composition in relation to the performance of the catalyst used and particle size selected as well as the effect of operation such as rate of fluidizing gas and reaction temperature. Moreover, it is demonstrated that conversion post-consumer LDPE/HDPE/PP polymer waste to volatile hydrocarbons was more than 80wt% of feed in 20min in the presence of cracking catalysts with fluidized-bed reactor used in this study. It is also shown that from a practical point of view, this study gives promising results as an alternative technique for the cracking and recycling of post-consumer polymer waste.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste (LDPE/HDPE/PP) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition, and reaction conditions."
"Efficient production of hydrogen-rich syngas by pyrolysis coupled with catalytic steam reforming of degradable polylactic acid waste plastics over high-entropy oxide catalyst To mitigate the solid waste crisis, converting waste plastics into valuable products through thermochemical processes, such as through pyrolysis, is emerging. Polylactic acid (PLA) plastics are difficult to separate from other plastics in solid waste, and mixed waste is usually directly landfilled or incinerated. Moreover, studies focused solely on the pyrolysis of PLA plastic remain relatively scarce. The large amount of tar produced during plastic pyrolysis can reduce the high-value production of hydrogen, and high-entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst exhibit excellent performance in tar conversion and anti-carbon deposition. In this research, HEO catalyst was synthesized by the sol-gel method for the pyrolysis of waste PLA plastic volatiles, aiming to generate H2-rich syngas in a two-stage integrated reactor system. During catalytic reforming, the highest hydrogen production was 124.1 mmol∙gPLA −1, and the gas yield based on plastic mass reached 259.8 wt%. The superiority of HEO catalyst stems from the synergistic interaction of various elements, enhancing the structural stability of the high-entropy system and increasing oxygen vacancies, resulting in strong C–C and C–H bond-breaking capabilities in the Ce, Mg, Fe, Co, and Ni HEO catalyst. In addition, this study investigated the mechanism of PLA’s simple pyrolysis and the role of the HEO catalyst in the catalytic steam reforming of PLA.

"The individual and cumulative effect of brominated flame retardant and polyvinylchloride (PVC) on thermal degradation of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) copolymer Acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) copolymers without and with a polybrominated epoxy type flame retardant were thermally degraded at 450 °C alone (10 g) and mixed with polyvinylchloride (PVC) (8 g/2 g). Gaseous and liquid products of degradation were analysed by various gas chromatographic methods (GC with TCD, FID, AED, MSD) in order to determine the individual and cumulative effect of bromine and chlorine on the quality and quantity of degradation compounds. It was found that nitrogen, chlorine, bromine and oxygen are present as organic compounds in liquid products, their quantity depends on the pyrolysed polymer or polymer mixture. Bromophenol and dibromophenols were the main brominated compounds that come from the flame retardant. 1-Chloroethylbenzene was the main chlorine compound observed in liquid products. It was also determined that interactions appear at high temperatures during decomposition between the flame retardant, PVC and the ABS copolymer.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste ABS copolymer mixed with PVC and a brominated flame retardant, with measurable product yields and composition analysis via GC methods."
"Chemical recycling of plastic wastes made from polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) The recycling of either model polymers or waste products based on low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene (PP) is examined using the dissolution/reprecipitation method, as well as pyrolysis. In the first technique, different solvents/non-solvents were examined at different weight percent amounts and temperatures using as raw material both model polymers and commercial products (packaging film, bags, pipes, food-retail outlets). The recovery of polymer in every case was greater than 90%. FT-IR spectra and tensile mechanical properties of the samples before and after recycling were measured. Furthermore, catalytic pyrolysis was carried out in a laboratory fixed bed reactor with an FCC catalyst using again model polymers and waste products as raw materials. Analysis of the derived gases and oils showed that pyrolysis gave a mainly aliphatic composition consisting of a series of hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes), with a great potential to be recycled back into the petrochemical industry as a feedstock for the production of new plastics or refined fuels.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product analysis, yielding aliphatic hydrocarbons and demonstrating recoverable fuel/feedstock potential."
"Preparation of MCM-22/ZSM-5 core–shell structured zeolite for catalytic cracking of polyethylene to selectively produce paraxylene The core–shell structured MCM-22/ZSM-5 zeolite (MZCS50) was synthesized through a combination of hydrothermal crystallization (to form the MCM-22 core) and steam-assisted crystallization (to form the ZSM-5 shell). The MCM-22 core exhibited lamellar cake-like shape with a diameter of 3 ∼ 4 µm, while the ZSM-5 shell consisted of aggregated nanoparticles. MZCS50 possessed a high specific surface area, a micropore-mesopore coexisting structure, and was Brønsted acid-dominant material. MZCS50 was used as a catalyst for the cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to produce BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes). The results showed that 550 °C was the optimal temperature for LDPE cracking. The maximum liquid yield achieved was 23.4 %, with selectivities to BTEX, xylenes and p-xylene of 79.8 %, 43.2 %, and 21.3 %, respectively. Repeated cracking experiments demonstrated that MZCS50 exhibited good stability and superior catalytic performance in converting toluene to xylenes and further transforming xylene isomers into p-xylene. These results indicate that the core–shell structured MZCS50 is a promising catalyst for converting plastic wastes into valuable p-xylene.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Stabilizing poly(vinyl chloride) using its blends with poly(methyl methacarylate): Pyrolysis GC/MS studies Binary blends of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with poly(methyl methacarylate) (PMMA) of various compositions were prepared through solution blending. Thermogravimetric and pyrolysis studies of these blends were carried out and the volatile products were separated and quantitatively analyzed by GC/MS. Harmful pyrolysis products from PVC like HCl and different aromatic hydrocarbons are significantly suppressed in presence of a small amount of PMMA. The stabilization effect on PVC was found to be the most significant with 10wt.%. PMMA contents in the matrix. Mechanism of the stabilization has been explained by the interaction of micro- and macro-radicals resulting from PMMA with PVC, which stabilize the unzipping of polymer chains by a reversible blocking mechanism and increase the amount of cross-linked residue retained above 500°C.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic blends (PVC and PMMA) with measurable product yields and GC/MS analysis of volatile products.
"Hospital plastic waste valorization through microwave-assisted Pyrolysis: Experimental and modeling studies via machine learning The COVID-19 pandemic generated a global upsurge in hospital plastic waste (HPW) as a consequence of the widespread utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) composed of diverse polymer materials. The constant demand for PPE worldwide led to the accumulation of substantial volumes of high-polymer-based plastic waste. To tackle this challenge, researchers delved into the conversion of HPW into valuable chemicals through a process known as microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). This method entails the transformation of HPW into high-quality char and liquid oil, which can serve as a source of fuel. In this study, our primary focus was to understand how the ratio of HPW (hospital plastic waste) to susceptor weight influenced the yields and characteristics of the resulting products in the context of the MAP process. To facilitate the experimental setup, a Central Composite Design (CCD) was employed. The impact of varying HPW weights and susceptor quantities on the production of value-added products was investigated. The analysis of condensed organic vapor decomposition revealed an increase in liquid yields (73.6 wt %, 76.6 wt %, 80.7 wt %) as the graphite content increased at a constant 30 g HPW. Conversely, gas yield decreased with higher susceptor and HPW quantity. Keeping the graphite constant at 4g, the gas yield declined (32.5 wt %, 30.7 wt %, and 24.7 wt %) as HPW increased. Additionally, gas yield exhibited a drop (32.5 wt % to 18.1 wt %) with an increase in both graphite and HPW. Furthermore, the residual yield decreased (from 1.7 wt % to 1.2 wt %) with a 30 g increase in HPW. In-depth analysis incorporated machine learning techniques to understand the behavior of response variables about susceptor and HPW quantities. The optimization of the MAP process for HPW encompassed various supplementary operational parameters, including susceptor thermal energy, average heating rate, microwave energy, specific microwave power, and product yields. Moreover, the residue generated from the MAP of HPW underwent characterization through X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR, and BET analysis.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of hospital plastic waste, a type of waste plastic, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization including XRD, FTIR, and BET."
"Thermochemical liquefaction of thermoplastic into fuel using toluene: Product distribution and behaviour The escalating accumulation of plastic waste presents a critical environmental challenge due to its resistance to degradation. Liquefaction, a thermochemical conversion process, emerges as a promising solution to convert plastic waste into valuable resources like fuel. The objective of this study was to investigate the behaviour of plastic polymer degradation in solvothermal liquefaction. This study comprehensively examines the liquefaction processes HDPE, LDPE, PS, and PP under 350–400 °C conditions and 30–90 min reaction times, using toluene as a solvent in an autoclave batch reactor. The results indicate that temperature significantly impacts liquefaction efficiency, with the following sequence: PS > PP > LDPE > HDPE. The liquefied products exhibit high heating values (HHV) of 40–44 MJ/kg, with viscosity and density comparable to gasoline and diesel. GC–MS and FTIR analyses reveal a composition rich in olefins, paraffins, and aromatics, producing carbon chain lengths from C6 to C20, aligning with conventional fuel. Finally, the mechanism of liquefaction for the polymers is proposed based on the chemical components found.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PS, PP) in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of fuel products."
"Simultaneous production of high-valued carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: The role of cellulose impurity Upcycling waste plastics into valuable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen via catalytic pyrolysis is a sustainable strategy to mitigate white pollution. However, real-world plastics are complex and generally contain organic impurities, such as cellulose, which have a non-negligible impact on the catalytic pyrolysis process and product distribution. In this study, cellulose was chosen as a model compound to distinguish the effects of oxygen-containing components on the CNTs and hydrogen production during the catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene. Different amounts of cellulose were mixed with polypropylene to regulate the O/C mass ratio of the feedstock, and the relationship between the O/C mass ratio and the yield of products has been built quantificationally. The results revealed that the relative content of CNTs increased to over 95%, and the stability and purity of carbon deposition increased accordingly when the O/C mass ratio is 0.05. This could be ascribed to the etching effects caused by small amounts of H2O and CO2 on amorphous carbon. However, further increasing the amount of cellulose caused the deactivation of the Fe-Ni catalyst. This not only decreased the carbon yield but had an adverse impact on its morphology and graphitization, leading to the increase of amorphous carbon. This study can provide fundamental guidance for the efficient utilization of waste plastics that take advantage of organic impurities in waste plastic to promote the formation of high-purity CNTs.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene with cellulose impurities, includes measurable product yields and catalyst performance, and provides experimental data on CNT yield and product distribution."
"Identification of oxygen carriers for chemical recycling of plastic waste using chemical looping technologies Chemical recycling of plastic waste is a promising technological alternative for the creation of a circular economy in plastics, enabling them to be used as raw material for the production of new plastics. Chemical looping (CL) technologies can facilitate the chemical recycling of plastics under different configurations. Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) allows combustion with inherent CO2 capture. In CLC, plastic waste can be burned to obtain a highly concentrated CO2 stream from which new plastics can be produced. The transformations involved in chemical looping gasification (CLG) produce a synthesis gas from which monomers can be created for the production of new plastics. The key to optimal operation in all CL processes is determining the most suitable oxygen-carrying material for each application. In this work, three highly reactive Fe-based materials (ilmenite, Fe20 and Mn66FeTi7) were tested as oxygen carriers in a batch fluidized bed reactor. The plastic waste was gasified inside the reactor and the gaseous products react with the oxygen carrier. Ilmenite was proposed as an oxygen carrier for CLG. Mn66FeTi7 was recommended for CLC of plastics with high-ash content and Fe20 showed the highest reactivity to plastic devolatilization products.",The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic waste in a batch fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance analysis.
"Pyrolysis of municipal plastic wastes separated by difference of specific gravity Municipal plastic wastes (MPWs) generated in Korea were separated by the difference of specific gravity (SG), and were classified as those with less than 1 SG (low MPW), 1–1.1 SG (medium MPW) and 1.1–1.2 SG (high MPW). These were well degraded into mainly liquid products in a stirred semi-batch reactor in the absence of oxygen at 400°C. In these types of MPWs, the order of liquid yield was medium MPW (about 90%)>low MPW (about 81%)>high MPW (76%). The medium MPW showed highest liquid yield, but lowest gas and residue yields. The physicochemical properties of the liquid products of the three types of MPWs were compared. The liquid products obtained were described by a cumulative amount as a function of lapse time of reaction and also by paraffin, olefin, naphthene and aromatic (PONA) products distribution as a function of carbon number. Three MPWs showed similarly short carbon number distribution consisting of mainly light liquid products, whereas the fraction of liquid PONA products, etc., was clearly different in the MPW types. For main liquid products, the case of low MPW was olefin components (>75%), medium MPW was aromatic components (>95%) and high MPW was methylmethacrylate (>55%), then aromatic (>20%) and phenol components (>15%). It is concluded that the different characteristics of liquid products of each MPW stem from different chemical nature and structure of plastic types contained in MPWs.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (municipal plastic wastes) in a semi-batch reactor, reports measurable product yields and product composition analysis, and includes experimental characterization of liquid products."
"Vermiculites from Brazil and Palabora: Structural changes upon heat treatment and influence on the depolymerization of polystyrene Although clay minerals have been widely used as catalysts and catalyst supports, the reports of natural clay minerals studied in their role as a catalyst are still rare. This work, therefore, for the first time reports the possible catalytic effects of the two raw vermiculites from Brazil (VerS) and Palabora (VerP) on the depolymerization of polystyrene (PS). The main experimental methods used to obtain a detailed structural characterization of vermiculites before and after the depolymerization experiment were X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric DTA/TG analysis, infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed assignment of the vibration bands of vermiculites occurring in the near-IR and the analysis of carbon coatings on the surface of vermiculite using Raman spectra are performed for the first time. The thermal products of PS are styrene monomer (SM) about 54.5 mass% and pyrolytic volatile oligomers (dimers and trimers) about 32.1 mass%. The presence of VerS and VerP changes the relation between SM (about 50.7 and 53.6 mass%, respectively) and oligomers (about 37 and 33.3 mass%) due to the pyrolytic carbons deposited on the VerS as coke and on the VerP as glassy carbon. The variable yields of the products can be attributed to the natural vermiculite properties such as are different negative layer charge emerging from the cation substitution in tetrahedra, number of water molecules released during thermal treatment, and textural properties (S BET and pores).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene using natural vermiculite catalysts, with measurable product yields, structural characterization, and analysis of catalytic effects."
"Fast co-pyrolysis of waste newspaper with high-density polyethylene for high yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons Waste newspaper (WP) was first co-pyrolyzed with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to enhance the yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons. The effects of WP: HDPE feed ratio (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100) and temperature (500–800°C) on products distribution were investigated and the interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis was also proposed. Maximum yields of alcohols and hydrocarbons reached 85.88% (feed ratio 50:50wt.%, 600°C). Hydrogen supplements and deoxidation by HDPE and subsequently fragments recombination result in the conversion of aldehydes and ketones into branched hydrocarbons. Radicals from WP degradation favor the secondary crack for HDPE products resulting in the formation of linear hydrocarbons with low carbon number. Hydrocarbons with activated radical site from HDPE degradation were interacted with hydroxyl from WP degradation promoting the formation of linear long chain alcohols. Moreover, co-pyrolysis significantly enhanced condensable oil qualities, which were close to commercial diesel No. 0.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste newspaper and high-density polyethylene, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Studies on thermal degradation of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS-Br) containing brominated flame retardant The thermal degradation of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS-Br; 10 g) containing brominated flame retardant (Br: 9.59 wt.%) was carried out at 450°C using a semi batch operation using two different temperature programs. The heating rate was found to affect the quality of the degradation oil and yield of products (liquid, gas and residue). Data on the effect of the temperature program on the accumulation of liquid products was presented. It was found that the majority of the bromine was concentrated in the carbon residue and while majority of the nitrogen accumulates in the liquid products irrespective of degradation mode. The use of a one step constant heating rate process (I) produced a higher liquid yield (39%), than a two step process (29%). Differences were also noted in the Br and N contained in the liquids produced by the two processes.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic ABS-Br with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as an alternative for energy production from waste valorization Disposal of waste plastics is an environmental problem that has gained attention over the years. Co-pyrolysis is a promising alternative for transforming this material into solid and liquid products with high added value. This study evaluated how heating rates and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) proportions influence the properties of char obtained by co-pyrolysis. The co-pyrolysis process was carried out using Eucalyptus spp biomass, in three proportions of PET (0, 15 and 25 %) and three heating rates (1, 3 and 5 °C min−1), at a final temperature of 450 °C. We investigated the physical, chemical, energetic and thermal properties of the char produced, which included its morphology via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average yield of co-pyrolytic char, under all conditions of co-pyrolysis, decreased by 5 % compared to the biomass-only pyrolytic material. In addition to yield differences, the percentage of ash decreased by about 7 % in char with PET. The produced material had a maximum heating value of 32,17 MJ kg−1 and maximum energy density of 4.7 Gcal m−3 (1.10 GJ m−3). These results show the synergistic effect between PET and biomass, pointing to improvements in char generated through co-pyrolysis. The addition of PET in the process, in all conditions investigated, contributed to potentiating the energy characteristics of the material. This co-pyrolysis process can be an alternative for generation and biofuels. The co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene terephthalate is a promising strategy for generating energy products and ensuring the reuse of plastic materials.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of PET, a waste plastic, with biomass, measuring char yields, ash content, heating value, and using SEM for characterization, demonstrating experimental data and conditions."
"Petrochemical feedstock from pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and polypropylene using different catalysts In this work, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of urban plastic waste composed of a mixture of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) was studied. The catalysts investigated were HZSM-5, USY, NH4ZSM-5 (ZSM-5 in ammonium form), and their corresponding alkaline-treated (BHZSM-5, BUSY, and BNH4ZSM-5) or acid-leached (LHZSM-5, LUSY, and LNH4ZSM-5) forms. The catalytic pyrolysis using BHZSM-5 (ZSM-5 in alkaline form), USY, BUSY, and NH4ZSM-5 resulted in higher amounts of liquid fraction, which was composed of alkylbenzenes, naphthalenes, and olefins. Acid leaching of zeolite NH4ZSM-5 increased both the specific area and the mesopore volume, allowing an increase in the liquid and gas fractions, and a reduction in the solid fraction. BHZSM-5 zeolite showed the best catalytic performance for the production of a high amount of liquid fraction, which was virtually composed of olefinic hydrocarbons without the formation of solid products. Moreover, BNH4ZSM-5 zeolite (alkaline-treated NH4ZSM-5) was a good pyrolysis catalyst also due to its high specific area and pore volume, resulting in higher gas formation in comparison with the liquid fraction (composed mostly of alkylbenzenes), and almost no solid fraction.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste PE and PP mixtures with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Valorizing polymeric wastes and biomass through optimized co-pyrolysis for upgraded pyrolysis oil: A study on TG-FTIR and fixed bed reactor The co-pyrolysis of biomass and polymeric wastes offers a promising approach for waste reduction and valuable product recovery while decreasing fossil fuel dependence. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of blending waste tire (WT) or polystyrene (PS) with sawdust (SD) at varying effective hydrogen/carbon ratio (H/Ceff) on liquid product distribution. Thermal degradation behavior was analyzed using TGA-FTIR, followed by fixed-bed reactor pyrolysis experiments at different temperatures. The devolatilization of SD primarily occurred between 185 and 390°C, while WT and PS decomposed between 250 and 500°C and 350–460°C, respectively. Results showed that SD addition to WT accelerated degradation at lower temperatures. Optimal H/Ceff ratios were 0.42 for WT/SD and 0.64 for PS/SD blends at 500°C, maximizing valued hydrocarbons, reducing pollutants, and yielding the highest liquid fraction. TGA-FTIR analysis revealed the presence of various functional groups, including C-H, CC, CO2, and O-H. The pyrolytic oil showed improved stability with significantly fewer undesired compounds. This research provides theoretical and practical insights into the control and application potential as well as the limitations of high-value energy products derived from the co-pyrolysis of SD, WT, and PS.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor pyrolysis of waste plastics (PS, WT) and biomass (SD), with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis oil."
"Co-pyrolysis of phenolic printed circuit boards with CaO and Ca(OH)2 mixture in a fluidized bed reactor: Optimization of the operating conditions and the kinetic analysis In a previous study (Haghi et al., 2023), we demonstrated that co-pyrolysis of paper-laminated phenolic PCB (FR2-PCB) with a mixture of CaO and Ca(OH)2 in a fluidized bed reactor results in the simultaneous enhancement of the production of the pyrolysis oil and a significant decrease in its halide content. To advance the utilization of a blend of CaO and Ca(OH)2 for scaling up the pyrolysis of FR2-PCB beyond laboratory-scale pyrolyzers, especially in fluidized bed reactors renowned for their effectiveness in large-scale pyrolysis of polymeric materials, the optimal operating conditions, as well as the kinetic parameters in the presence of CaO and Ca(OH)2 should be explored. To this end, this study focuses on optimizing the temperature (T), retention time (t), and PCB-to-additive ratio (FR2/A) as the parameters controlling the co-pyrolysis of paper-laminated phenolic PCB (FR2-PCB) with a 50:50 mixture of CaO and Ca(OH)2 in a fluidized bed reactor. According to the results of the experiments designed based on the response surface methodology, the maximum recovery of pyrolysis oil (40.6 %) was obtained at T = 620 °C, t = 22 min, and FR2/A= 5.4 g/g. Additional tests were carried out to explore the impact of CaO+Ca(OH)2 concentration on the halogen content of the pyrolysis products. Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to investigate the influence of the tested additives on the pyrolysis behavior and the kinetic characteristics of FR2-PCB. By employing three iso-conversional model-free approaches, i.e., the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), and Starink integral methods, it was found that adding CaO+Ca(OH)2 to FR2-PCB can reduce the activation energy of the pyrolysis reactions by 20 %.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized bed pyrolysis of waste phenolic printed circuit boards (a plastic-containing waste) with CaO and Ca(OH)2, reporting measurable yields, optimized conditions, and kinetic analysis with experimental data."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using nickel-doped gamma alumina spent adsorbent derived catalyst: Kinetics, thermodynamic and prediction modelling using artificial neural network (ANN) approach The present study is focused on evaluating the catalytic effect of nickel impregnated spent aluminium hydroxide nanoparticle (AHNP) adsorbent-based catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The analysis was conducted through kinetic and thermodynamic assessments. Specific kinetic parameters, such as activation energy and pre-exponential factor, along with thermodynamic parameters, including entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, was estimated using iso-conversional models such as Ozawa Flynn Wall (OFW), Kissinger Akahira Sunose (KAS) and Starink model. Thermogravimetric analysis of pyrolysis of walnut shell, HDPE, blend of walnut shell and HDPE (1:1) and blend of feedstock with catalyst (1:1) was conducted at different heating rates of 10–40 °C/min respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of nickel doped gamma alumina (NAO) catalyst lowered the activation energy (Ea) of co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and HDPE by 28 % as calculated by KAS method. Moreover, artificial neural network (ANN) was also applied for the predictive modelling of the degradation of walnut shell and HDPE where high regression (R≈0.99) as well as low mean squared error (<10−5) illustrated the accurate prediction of complex biomass and plastics degradation by the ANN model.

"Kinetic model for the pyrolysis and combustion of poly-(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) The kinetics of the global primary thermal decomposition of poly-(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste was studied in strict pyrolysis conditions and with different proportions of oxygen by TGA, between temperatures of 25 and 800°C. Prior to the decomposition, the polymer first melts at around 250°C. The pyrolysis of PET, which starts at 400°C, is modeled assuming that it is formed by two different parts which decompose by two independent reactions. The introduction of oxygen produces the appearance of a new process, which does not start until the pyrolysis finishes. This fact is interpreted as the combustion reaction of the char formed in the pyrolysis, and was modeled kinetically with a common combustion reaction to the solid char residues obtained from each initial fraction. One pyrolysis run and one combustion run at 850°C, at fuel-rich conditions were carried out to analyze the different gas compositions evolved, where an appreciable amount of poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was detected.","The study involves lab-scale TGA experiments on PET waste under pyrolysis conditions, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and PAH detection in gas composition."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel with nano MOF derived-loaded Y zeolite: Evaluation of temperature, zeolite crystallization and catalyst loading effects Catalytic pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste can serve as a means of refining nature from the non-degradable plastic pollutants while producing a significant amount of liquid fuel required for the transportation industry. The low quality of the produced liquid fuel is often a fundamental challenge in pyrolysis, which can be overcome by utilizing catalysts. In this study, an upgraded zeolite Y catalyst has been employed. However, one of the main issues with zeolites is their small pore size, which restricts the entry of heavy polymer compounds and only allows small molecules to enter. To address this limitation, an innovative approach has been applied in this research where MIL-53 (Cu) is loaded onto the surface of the zeolite. After pyrolysis, it was determined that a composite of copper and its oxides, enclosed in a carbon nanocarbon shell C60 and C70, has been loaded onto the surface of the zeolite. This inexpensive composite exhibit behavior similar to noble and expensive metals due to its high electron transfer density. Additionally, analyses XRD, FTIR, BET, XRF, EDX, GC–MS, NH3-TPD and CHNSO were utilized for the characterization of the catalyst and the liquid fuel. Furthermore, three key parameters were selected for experimental design: temperature (375–525 °C), catalyst loading in the reactor (2.5–17.5 %), and support crystallinity percentage (0–100 %). Using a response surface approach, the impact of these parameters on the liquid fuel production efficiency was investigated. Ultimately, the produced liquid fuel was separated into three fractions: gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. The effects of these primary parameters on the efficiency of each fuel type were determined using the response surface methodology.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste using a modified zeolite catalyst, with measurable experimental data on product yields, temperature effects, catalyst loading, and fuel composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis characteristics of polystyrene and polypropylene in a stirred batch reactor Kinetic tests on pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) were carried out with a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique at the heating rate of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0°Cmin−1 in a stirred batch reactor. The polystyrene was mainly decomposed between 370 and 410°C at the heating rates, whereas the polypropylene between 400 and 460°C. The apparent energy of activation and the apparent order of reaction were determined at conversions from 1 to 100%. The ranges of apparent energies of activation of polystyrene were from 164 to 249kJmol−1 at conversions in the range of 1–100% and the apparent order of reaction was 0.32. The apparent energies of activation of polypropylene increased slowly from 208 to 288kJmol−1 and the apparent order of reaction was 0.01. The effects of heating rate on the product distribution have been studied. The selectivity of hydrocarbons corresponding to the styrene monomer and dimer was very high for the pyrolysis of polystyrene.

"Styrene recovery from polystyrene by flash pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed reactor Continuous pyrolysis of polystyrene has been studied in a conical spouted bed reactor with the main aim of enhancing styrene monomer recovery. Thermal degradation in a thermogravimetric analyser was conducted as a preliminary study in order to apply this information in the pyrolysis in the conical spouted bed reactor. The effects of temperature and gas flow rate in the conical spouted bed reactor on product yield and composition have been determined in the 450–600°C range by using a spouting velocity from 1.25 to 3.5 times the minimum one. Styrene yield is strongly influenced by both temperature and gas flow rate, with the maximum yield being 70.6wt% at 500°C and a gas velocity twice the minimum one.","The study involves lab-scale flash pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of product composition."
"Sulphated zirconia catalysed conversion of high density polyethylene to value-added products using a fixed-bed reactor A sulphated zirconia catalyst (SZ) was investigated for catalytic conversion of high density polyethylene (HDPE) to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons using a fixed-bed reactor. The SZ catalyst reduced the onset of degradation from 337°C for HDPE alone to 187°C with 10wt% SZ added. At 450°C a complete weight loss was obtained with the SZ addition against only 4wt% loss for HDPE only. Fixed-bed reactor experiments using 2g of HDPE with 10wt% SZ catalyst with a 30min residence time showed a 98.0wt% conversion at temperature as low as 380°C. The liquid yield obtained was 39.0wt% with a composition of 16wt% paraffins, 21wt% olefins, 5wt% naphthenes and 58wt% aromatics. The carbon number distribution of the liquid was C7–C12, which is within the gasoline range. Equally, gaseous products ranging from methane up to different isomers of pentane which contained more paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbon were obtained. The sulphated zirconia catalyst was found to have high ammonia desorption (337.0μmolNH3 g−1), BET surface area (116.0m2 g−1), external surface area (112.0m2 g−1) and mesoporous structure.

"Pyrolysis of different types and sections of end-of-life tyres: Kinetics and experiments to improve product quality Pyrolysis contributes to the transition of the tyre industry towards a circular economy model. Tyre rubber is a complex blend of polymers, inorganic additives and grades of carbon black, depending on the tyre type and section. The products of the end-of-life tyres (ELTs) pyrolysis are heavily influenced by the original composition, so separation prior to pyrolysis could be an important step in optimising the recycling process. However, recyclers often ignore the composition of ELTs. This study aims to develop a simple methodology for evaluating the potential resource recovery of ETLs samples from a set of thermogravimetric experiments applying a Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM). Pyrolysis experiments were also carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to analyse the composition of the products. Direct linear relations were identified between specific values of the initial mass fraction parameter of the DAEM and the natural and synthetic rubber content, and notably with the limonene content in the pyrolysis oils. A high 12 wt% limonene in the oil product was obtained from the sample with the 83 wt% natural rubber content at 450 ºC. In addition, significant differences in the ash content were observed in the raw recovered carbon black from the tread sections (31 wt%-55 wt%) to the non-tread sections of the ELTs (7 wt%-16 wt%), which had a positive effect on its quality. This work demonstrates that the application of a straightforward methodology on separated types and sections of ELTs can greatly enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of their recycling processes.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of end-of-life tyres, a waste plastic material, with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Assessing the potential of the recycled plastic slow pyrolysis for the production of streams attractive for refineries The slow pyrolysis of recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated in a batch autoclave reactor at 430–490 °C and reaction times of 15–60 min, with the aim of obtaining the maximum yield of plastic oil (PO) with an adequate composition for its subsequent valorization in refinery. Specifically, PO yields up to 85–90 wt% have been achieved operating at 430 °C and 15–37.5 min, noting that the obtained yields strongly depend on temperature and, to a lesser extent, on reaction time. Simulated distillation and gas chromatography analyses of PO have shown its potential for its valorization in a waste refinery scheme targeting the production of alternative fuels. Thus, the PO obtained at 430 °C and 15 min is suitable to be cofed to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit since it has a simulated distillation curve similar to that of vacuum gasoil (VGO). On the other hand, the PO obtained at 430 °C at the longest reaction time and those obtained at 460 °C are suitable to be fed together with light cycle oil (LCO) into a hydroprocessing unit. The composition of naphtha and middle distillates of PO reveals that these fractions are appropriate for their blending with commercial diesel and gasoline pools after a mild hydrotreating to reduce their olefin content.","The study involves lab-scale slow pyrolysis of recycled HDPE plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis using simulated distillation and gas chromatography."
"Sustainable strategy for converting plastic waste into energy over pyrolysis: A comparative study of fluidized-bed and fixed-bed reactors This paper proposed a sustainable strategy for converting plastic waste into energy over pyrolysis to address the dual crises of environment and energy. A fluidized-bed reactor was designed for processing three different plastic waste (PP, LDPE and ABS). A product yield and properties from a fluidized bed system were comprehensively analyzed and compared with those from a fixed-bed system. The fluidized-bed reactor well converted ABS and PP wastes into pyrolysis fuel, exhibiting higher medium and low fraction (C5 ∼ C22 of 89.17 % for ABS) as compared to the amount from a fixed bed reactor (84.7 %) whereas LDPE and PP resulted in the similar product yields in the range of C5 ∼ C22 from both reactors. In case of LDPE, the given pyrolysis temperature (520 °C) was not feasible to properly process them into fuels so that dominant heavy oil (∼67.4 %) were produced regardless of the reactor type. GCMS analysis indicated that ABS pyrolysis oil is mainly composed of aromatics, aromatic-N and olefins whereas PP pyrolysis oil mainly includes olefins, paraffins and oxygenated compounds. From the current study, a potential use of a fluidized-bed reactor for pyrolysis was evaluated to overcome the major limitations of conventional pyrolysis process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, LDPE, ABS) in fluidized-bed and fixed-bed reactors with measurable product yields, GC-MS analysis, and reactor condition data."
"Effects of core materials on the evolution of products during the pyrolysis of end-of-life wind turbine blades A wind turbine blade consists of pure glass fiber-reinforced polymer composites (GFRPs) and the sandwich part with core materials. Pyrolysis is a prospective technology to recycle end-of-life blades, but the pyrolysis performance of blades with core materials is still unclear. In this study, three retired blade parts were pyrolyzed, i.e., pure GFRPs, GFRPs filled with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam, and GFRPs filled with balsa wood. The results showed that CH4, CO, and CO2 were the majority of the pyrolysis gas when the pure GFRPs part was pyrolyzed at 400ºC, with five typical phenolic products in the pyrolysis oil, containing bisphenol A, phenol, 4-isopropenyl phenol, 4-isopropyl phenol, and o-cresol. As the temperature increased to 550ºC, the content of CH4 reached 48.0 vol% while that of CO2 reduced, raising the calorific value of the pyrolysis gas to 27.2 MJ/Nm3. Meanwhile, the content of bisphenol A in the pyrolysis oil rapidly increased, owing to the enhanced breakage of oligomers. As PET foam was filled, CO2 was dominant in the pyrolysis gas, and the content of benzoic acid became comparable with those of phenols in the pyrolysis oil. Whilst several hydrocarbon substances were detected when balsa wood was filled, making the oil product more complex. In terms of solid products, char residues over the black fibers were formed mainly due to the decomposition of epoxy resin rather than core materials, and the oxidation duration should be extended when recovering the blade parts with sandwich structures. Moreover, elevating the pyrolysis temperature reduced the pyrolytic residues but degraded the recovered fibers’ tensile strengths. The conclusions suggested that the blade parts with sandwich structures should be pyrolyzed separately, considering the core materials and their components.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic-containing end-of-life wind turbine blades, including PET foam, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Upgrading spent battery separator into syngas and hydrocarbons through CO2-Assisted thermochemical platform To diminish the use of fossil fuels, there have been amplified technical developments of rechargeable batteries. With increasing demand of the secondary batteries, the recovery of useful materials from waste battery becomes significant. In this study, pyrolysis of battery separator in the lithium-ion battery was studied to fundamentally understand the thermal degradation of volatile compounds in the batteries and to recover hydrocarbons and syngas (H2/CO). To make this practice more environmentally sound, CO2 was used as a co-reactant. Pyrolysis under inert atmosphere (N2) was studied as a reference. Prior to battery separator pyrolysis, the composition of the separator (tri-layer of PP/PE/PP) and its thermolytic profile were confirmed. Single-stage pyrolysis converted the separator into aliphatic liquid hydrocarbons, while double-stage pyrolysis produced benzene derivatives, H2 and C1-2 hydrocarbons under both N2/CO2 environments. To further convert hydrocarbons into H2, NCM (lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide) cathode, one of widely used Li-ion battery cathodes, was used as a catalyst. In the presence of NCM catalyst, H2 production increased 25 times higher. In CO2 condition, catalytic pyrolysis resulted in remarkable CO formation through the homogeneous gas phase reactions between CO2 and gas phase volatile hydrocarbons degraded from thermolysis of battery separator.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of a waste plastic (PP/PE/PP tri-layer battery separator) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under controlled conditions."
"Temperature-dependent synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from plastic waste over A-site-deficient perovskite La0.8Ni1-xCoxO3-δ Thermochemical conversion of plastic wastes into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen is a promising management option to eliminate their hazardous effect. The yields and morphologies of CNTs strongly depend on the catalyst design and reaction conditions. To boost the efficiency, tuning of bimetallic nanoparticles as catalyst is an effective approach. For that reason, A-site-deficient perovskite La0·8Ni1-xCoxO3-δ (LN1-xCx, x = 0.15, 0.5, 0.85) was developed and used as a catalyst precursor to achieve in situ formation of bimetallic Ni–Co nanoparticles. At an optimized Ni-to-Co ratio, the LN0.5C0.5 exhibited the highest yields of multi-walled CNTs, namely 840 and 853 mg/gcatalyst from high density polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. This could be attributed to the higher catalytic capability of LN0.5C0.5 catalyst for the decomposition of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon. In both cases, multi-walled CNTs had regular shapes when the reaction temperature was 700 °C. At higher reaction temperatures, the morphological changes of carbon products were observed from multi-walled CNTs to carbon nano-onions. The Raman spectra showed that compared with the commercial multi-walled CNTs, the as-prepared multi-walled CNTs had a lower degree of defects.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE and PP) using a perovskite catalyst, with measurable yields of multi-walled CNTs and hydrogen, and detailed characterization of products and reaction conditions."
"Interfacial self-assembly of preformed colloidal nanocatalysts for pyrolysis upcycling of waste plastic Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics offers a sustainable approach to transform plastic waste into valuable carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes. Conventional methods for catalyst preparation provides limited control over catalyst morphology and loading. In addition, the powder catalysts remain entangled with the product carbonaceous materials and are difficult to separate. To mitigate these challenges, here, we present the first example of an interfacial self-assembly based approach for the construction of bulk catalysts with well-defined nanoscale morphologies for catalytic pyrolysis. The versatility of the self-assembly approach allowed us to deposit model Fe3O4 catalyst nanoparticles onto various types of supporting materials (S304, Ni, Ti, and Cu) to systematically investigate their impact on catalytic efficiency. Our studied revealed that CNT formation is influenced significantly by substrate-introduced effects. Among the tested supports, S304 system offered the highest selectivity for CNT growth, giving a carbon yield with a value of 207 mg/g plastic. While Ni and Ti generated more carbon products but with lower CNT mass ratio. Importantly, the self-assembled catalyst system also enables facile separation of carbon products from the support, offering a practical advantage over conventional powder-based systems. More broadly, our approach provides a versatile platform for designing robust and efficient catalysts with potential applications beyond plastic upcycling.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to produce carbon nanomaterials, with measurable product yields, reactor-based experiments, and analytical characterization of catalysts and products."
"Hydrogen-rich gas by catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene via mono and bimetallic Fe/Ni catalysts Catalytic thermal conversion represents a promising strategy for transforming waste plastics into high value products. This research demonstrates a two-stage pyrolysis catalysis integrated system for polyethylene valorization and hydrogen-enriched syngas production. Mono-/bimetallic Fe/Ni-ZSM catalysts were synthesized and systematically characterized to evaluate their structural and catalytic properties. Key operational parameters including metal loading, catalyst-to-polyethylene ratio, and steam flow rate were optimized to maximize gas yield and hydrogen selectivity. Experimental results revealed that bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with higher Ni content, exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to monometallic analogues due to the synergistic Fe–Ni alloy formation and enhanced metal-support interactions. Under optimal conditions (6 mL/h steam flow, 1:1 polyethylene-to-catalyst ratio), the 5Fe10Ni-ZSM catalyst achieved a hydrogen yield of 133.99 mmol/gPE with 70.40 % volumetric concentration in syngas. It was also found that irregular carbon nanostructures were formed on the surface of the spent catalyst. This study offers a novel method for repurposing waste polyethylene.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene waste plastic with measurable hydrogen yield, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Optimizing hydrocarbon yield from co-pyrolysis of Agave sisalana bagasse and multilayer plastic film wastes for sustainable fuel production using simplex-centroid mixture design and principal component analysis The production of alternative fuels to replace fossil-derived products constitutes a significant research topic, given the need for sustainable solutions that support energy transition and decarbonization of the transport sector. In this context, this pioneering study investigates the co-pyrolysis of Agave sisalana (sisal) bagasse with two types of multilayer plastic waste: polyethylene film with an aluminum barrier (PFA) and polyethylene film with an ethylene-vinyl alcohol barrier (PFE). The experiments were conducted in a micro-pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), using a simplex centroid mixture design to optimize compositions and principal component analysis (PCA) to interpret the data. While the isolated pyrolysis of sisal bagasse resulted in 58.78 % oxygenated compounds, co-pyrolysis with 50 % PFA provided a maximum yield of 91.39 % aliphatic hydrocarbons, representing a 2.97-fold increase compared to the pyrolysis of the isolated residue. PFA demonstrated a superior synergistic effect to PFE when combined with sisal bagasse. The results indicate that this combination can produce hydrocarbon-rich pyrolytic oil, significantly contributing to sustainable waste management and advancing the “waste-to-energy” concept by converting residual materials into alternative transportation fuels.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste multilayer plastic films (PFA and PFE) with biomass, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Mechanism of catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and polypropylene for hydrogen production: An experimental and DFT simulation study Co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) waste and cotton stalks (CS) addresses the dual environmental challenges of plastic pollution and agricultural residue disposal while leveraging their complementary properties (PP: H-rich; CS: C, O-rich) for enhanced H2 production. This study investigated the hydrogen production mechanism of lignocellulose via microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-MACFP) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations for the conversion of CS and PP. Co-MACFP (550 °C) with a SiC absorber was applied to PP-CS blends (1:1 ratio), mesoporous HZSM-5 (tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH)-modified, HT-1.0), and Ni-loaded HT-1.0 catalysts. The reaction mechanisms were determined via DFT simulations using β-d-glucopyranose and propylene as molecular models. The concentration of H2 obtained from the co-pyrolysis of CS and PP (the ratio is 1:1) was 32.7 vol% without catalysts, which exceeds the average concentration of 28.4 vol% ((27.1 + 29.7)/2) at 550 °C, indicating a synergistic effect between CS and PP. In addition, synergistic effects boost the H2 yield to 38.0 vol% with Ni-HT1.0 (vs. 32.7 vol% without catalysts), exceeding the theoretical averages from the individual feedstocks. PP-derived H· radicals (energy barrier: 454.8 kJ/mol) attack CS intermediates as the dominant low-energy pathway (204.4 kJ/mol), suppressing CO/CO2 formation via DFT. This integrated strategy enables efficient waste valorization and generation of green hydrogen. Future work should scale up catalyst synthesis and explore hybrid processes to improve economic viability.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of polypropylene waste and cotton stalks using a microwave-assisted reactor, with measurable H2 yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"TG-FTIR analysis of PVC thermal degradation and HCl removal The pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was qualitatively analyzed by TG-FTIR, and HCl removal efficiency of Ca-based additives were semi-quantitatively studied also by means of TG-FTIR. Additionally, the thermodynamic equilibrium modeling was also carried out to understand the formation of HCl from PVC and from mixtures of PVC with different additives. Experimental results showed that the pyrolysis of PVC took place in two steps accompanied by the release of HCl and hydrocarbon, respectively. Almost all Cl transformed to HCl, and hardly any other kinds of Cl compounds were detected. The addition of Ca-based additives extended the second weight loss step of PVC, but they did not affect the release time when the maximum HCl concentration appeared. The maximum HCl concentration decreased according to the increase of additive amount, that is to say, the HCl removal efficiency increased as the Ca/Cl molar ratio increased, however when the Ca/Cl ratio increased to a certain value, the increase of HCl removal efficiency was not proportional to the increase of additive amount. For different additives, different Ca/Cl ratios should be chosen based on the cost, HCl removal efficiency and utilization efficiency of additive.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PVC waste plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis using TG-FTIR and thermodynamic modeling."
"A combined two-stage process of pyrolysis and catalytic cracking of municipal solid waste for the production of syngas and solid refuse-derived fuels Pyrolysis combined to either thermal cracking or catalytic cracking of municipal solid waste was performed in a laboratory-scale facility consisting of a fixed-bed reactor followed by a tubular cracking reactor. The results showed great potential for the production of syngas. The incorporation of inexpensive and widely available dolomite in the cracking reactor (with a constant feedstock to calcined dolomite ratio of 5:1) favoured the catalytic cracking of the primary pyrolysis products towards H2 and CO in a temperature range of 800–900 °C. More particularly, it was possible at 900 °C to achieve a syngas consisting of more than 80 vol% CO and H2 with a heating value of 16 MJ/Nm3. Additionally, a homogeneous solid fuel was obtained as a solid residue, which can be used to provide additional energy to support the process or as a refuse-derived fuel. Thus, the great potential of this process was demonstrated for turning municipal solid waste into a valuable gas fraction that can be used directly as a fuel or as a source of different value-added products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal solid waste, a form of plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and fuel properties analyzed."
"Chemical recycling of cycloolefin-copolymers (COC) in a fluidized-bed reactor The pyrolysis of cycloolefin-copolymers (COC) in a fluidized-bed reactor was studied under various parameters like pyrolysis temperature, fluidizing gas or residence time. It was proven to reduce the undesired tar fraction to a minimum of around 10wt.% and to obtain up to 44wt.% valuable gases and 45wt.% aromatic light oils with a reactor temperature of 700°C. Furthermore, the mechanism of the pyrolytic degradation has been analyzed to determine if the comonomer 2-norbornene can be obtained by pyrolysis. In all experiments, only traces of around 0.05wt.% were detected. It was learned that 2-norbornene is not stable enough to resist drastic pyrolysis conditions; rather it undergoes a Retro–Diels–Alder reaction to form ethene and cyclopentadiene.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized-bed pyrolysis of waste cycloolefin-copolymers (COC), a commercial plastic, with measurable yields of gases, aromatic light oils, and tar, along with detailed product analysis and reactor condition parameters."
"Effects of interactions between organic solid waste components on the formation of heavy components in oil during pyrolysis This study focused on the interaction between organic solid waste (OSW) components on the formation and chemical composition of heavy components (>150 m/z) in OSW-oil. Rice husk (RH) and polypropylene (PP) as typical biomass and plastic fractions in OSW, were co-pyrolyzed at different blend ratios and different temperatures. The heavy components were characterized by FT-ICR MS, UV-F and GC MS. The results indicated that the yield of heavy components in PP-oil was higher than in RH-oil under the same temperature. Heavy hydrocarbons were found in PP-oil, while heavy phenols and heavy lipids existed in RH-oil. Significant interactions occurred at high temperatures (>600 °C). The interactions promoted the heavy components in all the blend-oils, corresponding to an increase of 20–35% compared to the calculated value of the content in PP-oil and RH-oil. At low PP ratio (25PP + 75RH), PP provided hydrogen to the reactive O-containing species in RH, leading to promoted heavy phenols and heavy lipids. At high PP ratio (50PP + 50RH and 75PP + 25RH), large aromatics (>3 rings) increased of 48–111% with respect to the calculated values. Plenty of PP‑hydrogen and a rich oxygen environment provided by RH radicals enhanced the formation of heavy aromatics and heavy PAH.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (plastic) and rice husk (biomass) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent heavy component analysis, and detailed characterization using GC–MS, FT-ICR MS, and UV-F."
"Co-pyrolysis of paper-laminated phenolic printed circuit boards and calcium-based additives in fixed and fluidized bed reactors This study compares the impact of the calcium-based additives and the pyrolyzer on the recovery and the halide content of the oil produced from the pyrolysis of paper-laminated phenolic resin printed circuit boards (FR2-PCB). The preliminary experiments showed that the maximum liquid recovery (40.6%) was achieved in a fluidized bed pyrolyzer containing a 50:50 mixture of CaO and Ca(OH)2 operating at T = 620 °C and PCB-to-additive ratio (FR2/A) = 5.4 g/g for 22 min. Extra tests were then carried out under these conditions in fixed and fluidized bed pyrolyzers to separately explore the impact of CaO, Ca(OH)2, and CaO + Ca(OH)2 on the liquid recovery (L R) and the halogen content of the non-solid products. In the fluidized bed, L R in the presence of CaO, Ca(OH)2, and CaO + Ca(OH)2 was 34.5%, 41.2%, and 38.9 wt%, respectively. The fraction of phenolic compounds in the pyrolysis oil ranged from 86% to 93%, about 1–3% higher than the corresponding values in the fixed bed. Using additives led to lower halide content in the pyrolysis oil of the fluidized bed than that of the fixed bed. However, the opposite trend was observed in the absence of additives. Regardless of the type of pyrolyzer, Ca(OH)2 was more successful than CaO in increasing L R, whereas CaO was more effective than Ca(OH)2 in pyrolysis oil dechlorination. Co-pyrolysis of FR2-PCB and CaO + Ca(OH)2 in a fluidized bed reactor was identified as a practical approach to enhance the recovery of pyrolysis oil comprising only 5% of the original halogen content of the feedstock.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic-containing printed circuit boards (FR2-PCB) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Desulfurization and upgrade of pyrolytic oil and gas during waste tires pyrolysis: The role of metal oxides Pyrolysis can effectively convert waste tires into high-value products. However, the sulfur-containing compounds in pyrolysis oil and gas would significantly reduce the environmental and economic feasibility of this technology. Here, the desulfurization and upgrade of waste tire pyrolysis oil and gas were performed by adding different metal oxides (Fe2O3, CuO, and CaO). Results showed that Fe2O3 exhibited the highest removal efficiency of 87.7 % for the sulfur-containing gas at 600 °C with an outstanding removal efficiency of 99.5 % for H2S. CuO and CaO were slightly inferior to Fe2O3, with desulfurization efficiencies of 75.9 % and 45.2 % in the gas when added at 5 %. Fe2O3 also demonstrated a notable efficacy in eliminating benzothiophene, the most abundant sulfur compound in pyrolysis oil, with a removal efficiency of 78.1 %. Molecular dynamics simulations and experiments showed that the desulfurization mechanism of Fe2O3 involved the bonding of Fe-S, the breakage of C-S, dehydrogenation and oxygen migration process, which promoted the conversion of Fe2O3 to FeO, FeS and Fe2(SO4)3. Meanwhile, Fe2O3 enhanced the cyclization and dehydrogenation reaction, facilitating the upgrade of oil and gas (monocyclic aromatics to 57.4 % and H2 to 22.3 %). This study may be helpful for the clean and high-value conversion of waste tires.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of pyrolytic oil and gas."
"Recovering high-quality glass fibers from end-of-life wind turbine blades through swelling-assisted low-temperature pyrolysis The recycling of end-of-life wind turbine blades has become a global environmental challenge driven by the rapid growth of wind power. Pyrolysis is a promising method for recovering glass fibers from these discarded blades, but traditional pyrolysis is often operated at high temperatures, which degrades the mechanical properties of recovered fibers. To address this issue, a swelling-assisted pyrolysis method was proposed to recover high-quality glass fibers from end-of-life wind turbine blades at low temperatures. The results confirmed that the decomposition of the resin matrix within the blade was significantly promoted at low temperatures in the swelling-assisted pyrolysis process, achieving a resin decomposition ratio of 76.8 % at 350 °C. This improvement was attributed to enhanced heat transfer and co-pyrolysis with acetic acid. Swelling could physically disrupt the cross-linked structure of the blade, creating a more porous and layered structure, thereby enhancing heat transfer during the pyrolysis process. Simultaneously, the co-pyrolysis with acetic acid could generate hydrogen radicals, which promoted the cracking of macromolecular oligomers into lighter products or gaseous alkanes. Consequently, the formation of pyrolysis char within the solid pyrolysis product was reduced, shortening the oxidation duration to 30 min. In comparison to traditional pyrolysis, the swelling-assisted pyrolysis process effectively suppressed the diffusion of surface defects over the recovered fibers, leading to promising improvements in their flexibility, elasticity, and mechanical properties, with tensile strength notably increased by 27.5 %. These findings provided valuable insights into recovering high-quality glass fibers from end-of-life wind turbine blades.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of end-of-life wind turbine blades, a waste plastic composite, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product characterization including mechanical properties of recovered fibers."
"The catalytic cracking of sterically challenging plastic feedstocks over high acid density Al-SBA-15 catalysts The catalytic cracking of polyolefinic waste materials over solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites, is a promising process for the production of useful fuels and chemicals. However, the inherent diffusional constraints of the microporous zeolites restrict the access of bulky polyolefin molecules to the active site, therefore limiting their effectiveness. To address this, a simple yet effective method of producing mesoporous Al-SBA-15 materials with a high density of Brønsted acid sites has been employed. These catalysts are shown to be very active for the catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE), a common waste plastic. The acidic and textural properties of the catalysts were characterised by ICP-OES, XPS, XRD, N2 physisorption, propylamine-TPD, pyridine-FTIR and STEM and have been correlated with their catalytic activity. The product distribution from the catalytic cracking of LDPE has been shown to depend strongly on both the pore architecture and the Al content of the SBA-15 and thus the density and strength of Brønsted acid sites. Fine-tuning the Al content of the SBA-15 materials can direct the product distribution of the hydrocarbons. The Al-SBA-15 materials display increased cracking orientated towards aliphatic hydrocarbons compared to ZSM-5, attributed to the mesoporous nature of SBA-15, overcoming diffusional limitations.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product distribution, catalyst characterization, and experimental analysis of yield and composition."
"Uncovering the differences: A comparison of properties of crude plastic pyrolytic oil and distilled and hydrotreated plastic diesel produced from waste and virgin plastics as automobile fuels Thermal pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (MWP) and mixed virgin plastics (MVP) containing high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) at 1:1:1 ratio were performed in a 20L pyrolytic pilot-scale batch reactor. The pyrolysis was conducted at 540 °C temperature and atmospheric pressure for 6 h. The properties of the produced crude plastic pyrolytic oil (CPPO or crude PPO), such as higher heating value (HHV), cetane index, lubricity, flash point, etc, obtained by pyrolysis of MWP, and MVP samples, confirmed that the oil was not suitable for direct use as an automobile fuel. Therefore, CPPO was further refined by vacuum distillation to match the properties of standard diesel more closely, herein referred as distilled plastic diesel (DPD). Some of the properties of DPD did not meet the standard diesel criteria, which is why DPD was further refined through a hydrotreatment process to ensure it was directly comparable to standard diesel, herein referred as hydrotreated plastic diesel (HPD). The fuel properties of all crude PPO, DPD and HPD were analysed and compared to standard (consumer) diesel according to Australian, ASTM and EN standards to assess their suitability as automobile fuel. With the aid of a 20L pyrolizer and a pilot-scale distillation and hydrotreatment plant, this comprehensive study demonstrated the importance of distillation and hydrotreatment for CPPO and found that DPD and HPD are well suited for use as drop-in diesel fuels. The results signify that with the right choice in refining technologies, waste plastics can be used as a source of automobile fuel.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PS) with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and refining processes, including distillation and hydrotreatment, with explicit experimental data on crude oil, distilled, and hydrotreated products."
"Comparative study on pyrolysis behaviors and chlorine release of pure PVC polymer and commercial PVC plastics The organic and inorganic additives in PVC plastics cause great difficulties in their actual recycling process, which are different from pure PVC polymer (PVC-PO). In this study, PVC-PO and two commercial PVC plastics were selected and their differences in structure, pyrolysis behavior, chlorine release and migration were compared by FTIR, TG-MS and a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor. There were more oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic compounds in the commercial PVC plastics than PVC-PO because of the addition of foaming agents, flame retardants and lubricants. The thermal weight loss of the commercial PVC plastics was divided into three stages due to the decomposition of additives and the releases of CO2 gas, while that of the PVC-PO was two. The pyrolysis tar of two PVC plastics contained 35.72% and 15.71% oxygenated compounds, respectively, while that obtained from PVC-PO contained 96.46% of aromatic compounds. In addition, calcium additives in PVC plastics could promote the cracking of heavy constituents in the volatile, which was favorable for the formation of more light fractions in tar. The pyrolysis gas of PVC-PO was mainly composed of H2 and C1-C4 hydrocarbon gases, while that of PVC plastics contained about 50% of CO2, followed by H2 and hydrocarbon gases. The chlorine content of the PVC-PO (55.88 wt.%) was higher than that of the PVC plastics (13.83 wt.%, 22.77 wt.%). Most of the chlorine in the three PVC samples released as HCl at 220–370 °C, while the peak temperature of dechlorination of the PVC-PO delayed about 8 °C compared to that of PVC plastics and small part of HCl also released at around 475 °C in the pyrolysis of PVC-PO. About 99.90 wt.% of the chlorine was distributed in the gas phase after PVC-PO pyrolysis, while there were 99.85 wt.% and 97.85 wt.% of chlorine was detected in the gas products of two PVC plastics.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of commercial PVC plastics and pure PVC polymer, with measurable product yields, chlorine release, and detailed analytical characterization."
"Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge with hydrogen-rich polythene: Effects on synergistic promotion and bio-oil quality Co-pyrolysis of biomass with hydrogen-rich feedstock is a promising technology to improve bio-oil quality, in which understanding the synergistic effects and product of sewage sludge (SS) with two types of plastic waste (HDPE, LDPE) is essential to develop co-pyrolysis technology. This work used in situ tracking to detect co-pyrolysis promotion/inhibition effects with different mixed feedstocks and mixing ratios, and analyzed volatile and bio-oils in detail. The results show that co-pyrolysis synergistic promotion was mainly created by the release of a large amounts of free radicals, and the largest promotion occurred near the maximum mass loss rate (DTGmax). The synergistic promotion effect was 190 % higher for SS mixed with HDPE (S–H) than for SS mixed with LDPE (S-L). Co-pyrolysis reduced polluting gases (e.g., NO2, and SO2), enhanced the degradation of oxygenated functional groups, contains 2.7 times of hydrocarbons in bio-oil than SS mono-pyrolysis. S-L promoted short-chain generation and produced more naphthalene compounds (e.g., methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) in hydrocarbons. However, S–H tends to produce longer chains and more monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., alkylbenzenes). The gasoline fraction in bio-oil could reach 89.7 % (S7L3) and 55.8 % (S5H5).

"Comparative study of thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene at moderate temperatures. Effects of vacuum and the molecular weight of polystyrene on the selectivities of styrene and other aromatic products This work evaluates the effect of the molecular weight of the polystyrene (PS) feedstock on the styrene selectivity of a thermal PS pyrolysis process at moderate temperatures (≤450 °C) developed at our lab. Also, acid and basic thermal catalytic pyrolysis were compared with the mentioned thermal process. These experiments were carried out under positive pressure using commercial PS as feedstock; but a thermal pyrolysis process under vacuum conditions was also tested, exhibiting increases in monomer yield from 19 % to 48 % (area-based). The polystyrene molar mass strongly influenced the monomer yield in thermal pyrolysis experiments. Catalytic experiments were carried out using commercial zeolites like ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil – 5) and zeolites-HY (hydrogen form of zeolite type Y) as acid catalysts. For basic catalytic experiments, calcium oxide (CaO) was used in pure (in-situ) and supported in fumed silica (CaO/SiO2) (ex-situ) forms. The styrene yields (area-based) for the zeolite-catalyzed pyrolysis were in the range of 12–13.4 %, while for the CaO in-situ was 25 % and for the CaO/SiO2, 18 %. The selectivity of styrene and other aromatic byproducts as isomers of monoaromatics, dimers and trimers among the different pyrolysis processes is also compared. All the obtained pyrolysis products in the liquid fraction were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and the main compounds were identified. The pyrolysis type (catalytic/thermal) had a profound effect on the product selectivity. The vacuum process led to a significant increase in monomer yield at a moderate temperature (400 °C), that allows for a pyrolysis process with relatively low energy consumption.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of commercial polystyrene feedstock with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis, and reactor condition details."
"Microwave pyrolysis of polypropylene, and high-density polyethylene, and catalytic gasification of waste coffee pods to hydrogen-rich gas Plastic waste poses a critical environmental challenge for the world. The proliferation of waste plastic coffee pods exacerbates this issue. Traditional disposal methods such as incineration and landfills are environmentally unfriendly, necessitating the exploration of alternative management strategies. One promising avenue is the pyrolysis in-line reforming process, which converts plastic waste into hydrogen. However, traditional pyrolysis methods are costly due to inefficiencies and heat losses. To address this, for the first time, our study investigates the use of microwave to enhance the pyrolysis process. We explored microwave pyrolysis for polypropylene (PP), high-density polypropylene (HDPE), and waste coffee pods, with the latter primarily comprising polypropylene. Additionally, catalytic ex-situ pyrolysis of coffee pod pyrolysis over a nickel-based catalyst was investigated to convert the evolved gas into hydrogen. The single-stage microwave pyrolysis results revealed the highest gas yield at 500 °C for HDPE, and 41 % and 58 % (by mass) for waste coffee pods and polypropylene at 700 °C, respectively. Polypropylene exhibited the highest gaseous yield, suggesting its readiness for pyrolytic degradation. Waste coffee pods uniquely produced carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases because of the oxygen present in their structure. Catalytic reforming of evolved gas from waste coffee pods using a 5 % nickel loaded activated carbon catalyst, yielded 76 % (by volume) hydrogen at 900 °C. These observed results were supported by elemental balance analysis. These findings highlight that two-stage microwave and catalysis assisted pyrolysis could be a promising method for the efficient management of waste coffee pods, particularly for producing clean energy.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene, which are waste plastics, with measurable product yields and catalytic gasification experiments yielding hydrogen-rich gas."
"Study on mild cracking of polyolefins to liquid hydrocarbons in a closed batch reactor for subsequent olefin recovery The polyolefins mild cracking experiments have been carried out in a closed batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere over a temperature range from 370 °C to 420 °C and the characterization of the mild cracking products has been investigated. The objective of this work is to study the cracking mechanism and reaction path for the mild cracking of polyolefins with lower heating rate (the isothermal and non-isothermal process), and to find the appropriate operating conditions (temperature and residence time) for optimal yield of liquid hydrocarbons (oils/waxes) as the suitable feedstock of olefin recovery. The advantages of this work can be summarized as high yield of light fraction, low aromatics content and mild cracking conditions. More viscosity-reducing and less volatiles-loss can be simultaneously achieved in mild cracking of polyolefins by selecting the reasonable residence time-temperature combination. The results confirm that chain scission reactions are significantly predominant in these experimental conditions. Intramolecular hydrogen transfer and intermolecular hydrogen transfer, which are responsible for the reduction in molecular weight of liquid products, can be improved in lower temperature and longer residence time, and intermolecular hydrogen transfer can also be enhanced in the PE/PP mixture cracking. For polyolefins mixture cracking, the cracking temperature can be reduced about 20 °C, or the cracking time can be shortened significantly, and so utilizing the whole polyolefins mixture without a need of further separation is very desirable in the chemical recycling.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyolefins (a type of plastic) in a batch reactor with measurable temperature–yield relationships, product characterization, and defined experimental conditions."
"Pyrolysis of solid waste in a rotary kiln: influence of final pyrolysis temperature on the pyrolysis products Temperature is one of the most important parameters in pyrolysis reaction. In present work, an externally heated laboratory-scale rotary-kiln pyrolyser was designed and developed. The influence of final pyrolysis temperature (FPT) on the pyrolytic products of solid wastes has been studied. Raising FPT caused increasing gas yield and decreasing semi-coke yield. The average heat value of the gas also changed with FPT. The content of aliphatic hydrocarbons in PE tar increased initially and then decreased with increasing FPT. Parallel to this, the content of aromatic ring changed conversely. FPT had obvious influence on the primary and elemental analysis data of the semi-cokes. The CO2 reactivity of the semi-cokes also varied with the FPT. The kinetic parameters of the semi-cokes were different for the same material at the different FPT.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics in a rotary kiln reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products and semi-cokes."
"Principal component analysis for kinetic scheme proposal in the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste tyres Principal component analysis is used as a pattern recognition method to find criteria for grouping into lumps the compounds formed in the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste tyres. This information is the stating point for the proposal of simple kinetic schemes that efficiently describe the complex reactions that occur in the pyrolysis process. It has been proven that the kinetic scheme must consider a depolymerization step of the waste to give isoprene and styrene monomers and the dimer of the former (limonene), the formation of primary products (char, tar and gas) by thermal cracking of the original high molecular weight compounds, and the subsequent secondary reactions by thermal cracking of heavy primary fractions (tar) to form lighter fractions (gas, gasoline and C10− aromatics). The use of a catalyst prepared based on a HY zeolite selectively enhances the reactions of condensation and alkylation of limonene and gasoline to aromatics, whereas the one based on a HZSM-5 zeolite selectively enhances the cracking of tar to lighter fractions (gas and C10− aromatics), limonene cracking to isoprene and C5–C10 hydrocarbons or even the cracking of the latter to C1–C4 gases.","The study involves experimental thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste tyres, a type of plastic waste, with measurable product formation and catalyst performance analysis."
"Analysis and control of products obtained from pyrolysis of polypropylene using a reflux semi-batch reactor and GC-MS/FID and FT-ICR MS Pyrolysis of plastic waste allows to produce liquid fractions, but their molecular weight distributions are typically very large whereas it would be interesting to focus on light hydrocarbons. In this study, the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was investigated using a semi-batch, vertical glass reactor heated at 480 °C equipped with a reflux condenser. The pyrolysis was performed with and without a reflux condenser. The temperature at the top of this reflux condenser was ranged from 125 °C to 200 °C depending on the heating power at the wall of this condenser. The permanent gas yield (C1 to C4) ranged between 20.9 wt% and 25.8 wt% when the reflux was used. The gas contained mainly hydrocarbons with a carbon range from C1 to C4 and H2 in a smaller extent. Their kinetic profiles followed a similar trend, i.e they exhibited a maximum with time. The GC-MS/FID detected mainly olefinic hydrocarbons (olefins) with less than 28 carbons. The major hydrocarbons obtained were light and heavy naphtha cuts when the reflux was used. The range of light naphtha (C5-C7) was between 13.1 and 16.7 wt% and the range of heavy naphtha (C8-C12) was between 69.1 and 87.2 wt% of the total mass fraction detected. The experiments demonstrated that the presence of the reflux has a significant impact on the liquid and gas yields. It allows to narrow the molecular weight distribution range of the liquid, which was confirmed by FT-ICR MS. As a consequence, the molecules of interest are maximised, especially those corresponding to the naphtha cuts.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene waste using a semi-batch reactor with measurable yields, temperature-dependent product analysis, and detailed characterization via GC-MS/FID and FT-ICR MS."
"Nickel promoted Si-rich ZSM-5 nanocatalyst remarkably converts LDPE plastic waste to gasoline range hydrocarbons in a dual-bed semi-batch reactor at atmospheric pressure Catalytic pyrolysis is an environmentally friendly recycling method, which has attracted remarkable attention due to worldwide issues of the production and accumulation of plastic wastes. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was carried out in a dual-bed semi-batch reactor over the Si-rich Ni/ZSM-5 nanocatalyst at atmospheric pressure. The parent nanocatalyst was prepared by hydrothermal technique and modified with nickel promoter (0–25 wt%). The properties of the nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, NH3-TPD, and TG-DTA techniques. The results showed the high crystallinity, spherical particles, and high specific surface area (376 m2g−1). The impact of operational conditions was evaluated to maximize the production of the high value-added compounds. The high percentage of the Ni promoter (25 wt%) led to the highest amount of gasoline range hydrocarbons (61%). The appropriate operational conditions were temperature of 525 °C, catalyst to plastic ratio of 1:20, and 2.5 ml min−1 nitrogen flow rate, resulting in the best product distribution: aromatics (39.4%), olefins (28.3%), and paraffins (15%). The reusability of the nanocatalyst showed high performance and more aromatic production. The characterization results of the used nanocatalyst confirmed the high stability through the pyrolysis reaction and lack of significant structural defect. The developed nanocatalyst represented the high activity through the pyrolysis of the real LDPE plastic waste, including the major product distribution in the gasoline range hydrocarbons.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE plastic waste in a lab-scale dual-bed semi-batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Pyrolysis characterization and mechanism studies of different structural plastics: A comparative study at optimal temperatures Thermal conversion technology is an effective means to transform waste plastics into high-value-added products. This study explored the thermal decomposition characteristics and cracking mechanism of four different types of plastics (polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) for thermal conversion technology. The findings revealed that PP exhibited the highest hydrogen yield, reaching 3.56 mmol/g at 510°C. PET's gas production was predominantly comprised of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. PVC gas products contained a significant amount of HCl, followed by hydrogen and methane. For solid products, the carbon yield followed the order PET > PVC > PS > PP, with the carbon content of PET accounting for 35.63% of the total products. PP and PS demonstrated higher oil yields for liquid products than PET and PVC. The oil yield of PP was 94.38%. Further analysis of the cracking mechanism found that during the thermal decomposition process, plastics underwent random fragmentation, leading to reactions such as β-scission, intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen transfer, rearrangement, cyclization, etc., due to structural variations. This work provided foundational data for the thermal decomposition studies of different types of plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PS, PVC, PET) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent results, and analytical characterization of products and mechanisms."
"Converting polyolefin mixtures into fuels via a closed-system pyrolysis process This work examined the effects of the experimental conditions in an oxygen-free closed system on the pyrolysis process of a polyolefin mixture (PO) composed of 40 % medium-density polyethylene (MDPE), 35 % low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and 25 % polypropylene (PP). The goal was to get the best yields and quality of gasoline and diesel-type fuels. The effect of the autogenic pressure was studied by varying the temperature (400, 425, and 450 °C) and reaction time (1, 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes). The effect of the initial pressure (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 bar) was studied at 425 °C and 60 minutes. The products obtained were gas, oil, and wax. The presence of coke was not observed. The preferred product for fuel production was oil. The temperature of the pyrolysis process decreased to 400–450 °C in an oxygen-free closed system from a usual 550 °C when the procedure was conducted in an open system. Gas and liquid chemical composition and simulated distillation behaviors were also studied in both processes. In the autogenic pressure process, the optimal variables for higher yield and quality of the fuel-like products were 425 °C, 30–45 min, and up to 33 bar. The effect of the initial pressure showed that higher pressures did not present an advantage in the PO cracking process. While the autogenic pressure was the result of an increasing gas formation and therefore presented an important effect on the products obtained, higher initial pressures (above 10 bar) seemed not to be required for the increment in the yield or quality of the products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of a mixture of commercial plastics (MDPE, LDPE, PP) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Aromatics production from segmented co-pyrolysis of poplar sawdust and high-density polyethylene: Enhancing the synergistic effects Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste is a promising approach for producing renewable biofuels and value-added chemicals. However, because of their different pyrolysis behaviors, the synergy between biomass and plastic is limited, and low-yield aromatics are produced. Herein, a modified segmented catalytic co-pyrolysis technology was proposed, and the effects of pyrolysis parameters were studied in detail to enhance the synergistic effect between feedstocks. For the biomass section (segment 1), catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of poplar sawdust was conducted, and results showed that employing 15 wt% MgCl2 at 500 °C facilitated the production of furans. For the plastic section (segment 2), CFP of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were performed. It was showed that instead of Y and beta zeolites, the utilization of ZSM-5 as a pyrolysis catalyst with a loading of ZSM-5/HDPE = 1.0, and a temperature of 600 °C was beneficial for the production of short-chain olefins. For the segmented co-pyrolysis of poplar sawdust and HDPE (segment 1 + segment 2), the biomass-to-plastic ratio was crucial in aromatics production. A ratio of 1:1 was found to be most effective in producing MAHs (54.8 area%), which was ∼3.9 or 1.6 times that for the separate CFP of biomass or HDPE. This was also consistent with its higher enhancement factor, confirming that the synergy between poplar sawdust and HDPE was dramatically enhanced. Finally, a segmented catalytic co-pyrolysis reaction pathway was proposed.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (plastic) and poplar sawdust (biomass) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed reactor conditions including temperature, catalyst loading, and feedstock ratios."
"Improving hydrogen production via ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of non-thermal plasma pretreated HDPE with 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst Fast pyrolysis coupled with catalysis is a promising method for recycling waste plastic into value-added fuels, chemicals, and carbon materials. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was pretreated by non-thermal plasma (NTP) in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor where the discharge zone was packed with quartz glass beads, which enables the HDPE to present a low-degree of polymerization, high crystallinity, and rough surface morphology. The fast pyrolysis of pretreated HDPE significantly increased the content of C2–C4 light olefins in the pyrolysis vapors, notably the C2H4 content increasing by 19.78 % and 27.88 % after Ar and air NTP treatment, respectively. Compared with Fe/γ-Al2O3 and Ni/γ-Al2O3, the novel 1Fe1Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst, which are characterized by a higher density of strong acid sites and superior ability to cleavage C−C and C−H bonds, possessed superior activity in upgrading of pyrolysis vapors, achieving a high H2 yield equivalent to 91.65 % hydrogen in HDPE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the C2H4 dissociation pathway prefers dehydrogenation followed by C−C bond cleavage and energetically favorable H2 evolution reaction (HER) rather than direct dissociation as indicated by lower dehydrogenation barriers on the surface of FeNi. This work provides a new insight for improving H2 yield in ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of HDPE.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste HDPE using a fixed-bed reactor with catalysts, reporting measurable product yields, catalytic performance, and product composition analysis."
"Plastics as a reburning fuel: Pyrolysis at reburning temperatures and NO-reburning by simulated pyrolysis gas Using waste plastics as a reburning fuel is promising for both reducing NOx emissions and managing plastic waste. To gain a better understanding of the chemistry involved in plastic reburning, pyrolysis products of different types of plastics at typical reburning temperatures (900–1200 °C) were investigated experimentally, and the reburning performance of simulated plastic pyrolysis gases was studied through experiments and chemical kinetic modeling. The plastics involved in the pyrolysis experiments included high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide 6 (PA6), and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer (ABS). HDPE exhibited the highest hydrocarbon gas yield (up to ∼ 70 wt% at 900 °C) while ABS had the lowest gas yield (<20 wt%) among the four plastics at the investigated temperatures. The hydrocarbon gas was composed mainly of methane, ethylene, and acetylene, with ethylene decreasing and acetylene increasing with temperatures rising from 900 to 1200 °C. Hydrogen cyanide was found to be the dominant gaseous nitrogen-containing compound for PA6 and ABS. Solid byproducts such as soot were generated at pyrolysis temperatures exceeding 1100 °C, leading to a reduction of the gas yield for all plastics. This indicates a potentially important contribution of heterogeneous NO reduction mechanisms during plastic reburning at high temperatures. Concerning the homogeneous NO reduction, reburning experiments using simulated plastic pyrolysis gases composed of methane, ethylene, and/or acetylene were carried out at 700–1200 °C in a flow reactor with an initial NO concentration of 1000 ppm and an excess air ratio λ of 0.7. Results for the simulated plastic pyrolysis gases showed NO reduction efficiencies ranging from 30 % to 46 % within the temperature range 950–1200 °C. The presence of acetylene in the simulated pyrolysis gas mixtures appears to facilitate NO reduction. A detailed chemical kinetic model applied to simulate the experiments gave a reasonable prediction of the NO reduction and revealed the important role of the ketenyl radical in removing NO.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PA6, ABS) at specified temperatures, with measured product yields, gas composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"Catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste to produce naphtha for a circular economy Catalytic cracking of plastics into naphtha as a substitute for new plastic production has the potential to contribute to the plastic circular economy. However, mitigating catalyst deactivation in large-scale processes poses a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate a remarkable improvement (4.3 × to 12.3 ×) in catalyst lifetime by utilizing hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts compared to conventional analogues. Increasing the Brønsted acid concentration from 0 to 302 µmol/g enhances catalyst lifetime by over 46 × and boosts cumulative aromatic selectivity from 6 to 73%. Catalyst characterization reveals the development of significant voids after modification, enhancing molecular transport within the hierarchical ZSM-5. Economic analysis shows a pilot system with a 10 ton/day capacity yielding an annual profit of $344,999 and an 11.5% return on investment. Life cycle assessment indicates a reduction of 817.6 kg CO2 eq compared to traditional plastic-to-fuels technology. These findings advance the plastic circular economy and bring us closer to commercial implementation.","The study involves catalytic microwave-assisted pyrolysis of plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Chemical recycling of waste polystyrene by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis: A description for different feedstocks, catalysts and operation modes Chemical recycling by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis/degradation offers the possibility of converting waste plastics into their original monomers or other valuable chemicals which can be used as feedstocks in chemical and petrochemical industries. Plastic wastes of polystyrene (PS) based materials can be a good source of styrene as well as mono-aromatic (BTEX: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) compounds. The selectivity of pyrolysis products can be tuned by choosing the right catalyst as well as appropriate operating conditions/operation modes. In this regard, the focus of the present work was to perform thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of different waste polystyrene (WPS) feedstocks over acid and base catalysts employed in ex-situ and in-situ modes. The main goal was to compare the compositions of pyrolysis products obtained by changing feedstocks, catalysts and operation modes. A further goal was to discuss the suitability of the catalysts employed for the enhanced recovery of desired products from WPS pyrolysis. It was demonstrated that expanded polystyrene gives very similar product distribution as compared to virgin PS, both giving high styrene content. Likewise, hard PS-based random packing materials produce similar results as compared to high impact polystyrene (HIPS). Moreover, it was shown that solid base catalysts influence the composition of the pyrolysis products only slightly as compared to thermolysis. Solid acid catalyst however, showed significant impact on the composition of the pyrolysis products as compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. These results may provide new insights for the chemical recycling of plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of waste polystyrene feedstocks with measurable product composition analysis, catalyst performance comparison, and operational mode effects, all indicating extractable experimental data."
"Waste plastic pyrolysis oils as diesel fuel blending components: Detailed analysis of combustion and emissions sensitivity to engine control parameters Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure energy security have led to increased interest in renewable energy technologies, particularly pyrolysis for converting waste into fuel. This study examines the use of polypropylene (PPO) and polystyrene (PSO) pyrolysis oils as diesel fuel (DF) blending components. Single-cylinder engine tests were conducted on PPO and PSO, each blended with DF in mass proportions of 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. The engine featured a state-of-the-art compression ignition combustion system, including an 8-hole high-pressure injector and precisely controlled air and exhaust gas recirculation paths. Results proved that both PPO and PSO could be efficiently combusted in modern compression ignition systems, provided their admixture with reference DF did not exceed 60 %. For optimal performance, the engine control map needed to be re-calibrated to prevent over-homogenization of the pilot spray, caused by higher volatility and reduced fuel reactivity. When maximising waste-derived components, PPO provided optimal emission results (1.37 g/kWh NOX and 0.04 g/kWh PM) when combined with heavy EGR and advanced injection timing. In this case, the total emissions overlimit value was 3.7, compared to 7.3 in the best-case DF scenario (a 50 % reduction in cumulative emissions). For minimizing emissions, small additions (20 %) of highly volatile PSO were found to offer the greatest potential for co-optimization. Compared to the optimal DF configuration, a cumulative emissions reduction of 81 % was achieved in the same calibration map region as for PPO.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP and PS) to produce oils used as diesel fuel blending components, with measurable product yields, engine performance, and emission data reported."
"Municipal plastic waste recycling in fluid catalytic cracking units: Production of petrochemicals and fuel in an fluid catalytic cracking pilot plant from biogenic and recycled feedstocks Decarbonization of industrial plants and integration of plastic wastes into a circular economy are increasingly finding their way into government strategy outlooks and actual legislation. By utilization of existing industrial processes for co-feeding of biogenic and/or recycled feedstocks the financial entry barrier to more sustainability in crude oil refineries could be lowered. Via usage of canola oil, together with syncrude derived from pyrolyzed plastic wastes, in a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) pilot plant the suitability of these feedstocks for co-feeding was confirmed. The experimental work was conducted on a continuously operating FCC pilot plant located at Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien). Maintaining an average cracking temperature of 550°C and a feeding rate of 2.5 kg/h, pure canola oil and three canola oil/ pyrolysis oil ratios (5, 10 and 20 %wt pyrolysis oil admixture) were processed. The results showed increased gasoline, olefin, and coke yields whilst co-feeding reduced the non-olefinic gas, light cycle oil and residue yields.","The study involves pyrolysis of plastic waste to produce pyrolysis oil, which is used as a feedstock in a fluid catalytic cracking pilot plant, with measurable product yields and reactor conditions reported."
"Pyrolysis mechanism and thermal degradation kinetics of poly(bisphenol A carbonate)-based polymers originating in waste electric and electronic equipment Poly(bisphenol A carbonate) or polycarbonate (PC) constitutes a significant fraction of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, mainly due to its high production and consumption rate and its variety of applications. Traditional methods for its treatment no longer appear to provide long-term solutions and for this reason, the investigation of thermochemical methods and more specifically pyrolysis as a potential recycling method took place in the current study. In the first part of this study, pyrolysis studies of polycarbonate have been performed in a Pyrolizer equipped with GC–MS, at five different reactor temperatures, in order to facilitate the understanding of the degradation mechanism. Higher pyrolysis temperatures were found to be more suitable for PC pyrolysis, since they increased the volatile fractions (liquid and gaseous). The gaseous fraction consisted mainly of CO2, CH4 and CO, whereas in the liquid fraction a large amount of different phenolic compounds, including the monomer bisphenol A was recorded. Based on the findings, it has been suggested that the main degradation pathway follows a chain scission mechanism and that the scission of the isopropylidene linkage is the first step. Phenols and phenolic compounds were formed through a series of scission and hydrolysis reactions. In the second part, pyrolysis kinetics of PC are investigated in detail using thermogravimetric experimental data, collected at several heating rates and several either model-free (isoconversional) or model-fitting models. From the isoconversional kinetic analysis the effective activation energy was fund to increase with the extent of conversion, ranging from 146 to 189 kJ/mol and from 154 to 215 kJ/mol, when using the integral method of Tang (similar to the KAS) or the differential method of Friedman, respectively. A simple first order kinetic model was found to simulate excellent the experimental data, though predicting different activation energies and pre-exponential factors at each heating rate employed. The random scission and the autocatalytic models were investigated in detail and the best fit to the experimental data at all different heating rates was found to be the autocatalytic model with n = 1.15 and m = 0.46 (values close to those considered for the random scission model with L = 2, i.e. n = 1.119 and m = 0.4) using an average activation energy, E = 195.9 kJ/mol and pre-exponential factor A = 6.06 1012 min−1. Having a detailed knowledge of the PC degradation kinetics and mechanism will help in better design of large scale process for the recycling of such material originating in WEEE and provide targeted value-added products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polycarbonate (PC), a waste plastic from electronic equipment, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization using GC–MS and TGA."
"Co-circularity of spent coffee grounds and polyethylene via co-pyrolysis: Characteristics, kinetics, and products Spent coffee grounds (CG) and polyethylene (PE) are the two typical types of major solid wastes. Their co-pyrolysis may be leveraged to reduce their waste streams and pollution and valorize energy and by-products. In this study, their co-pyrolysis performances, interaction effects, kinetics, and products were characterized in response to the varying temperature and blend ratio. The co-pyrolysis exhibited the two main stages of (1) the degradation of CG (180–380 °C) and (2) the depolymerization of PE and the decomposition of lignin (380–550 °C). The pyrolysis performance rose from 1.34×10−4%3·min−2·°C−3 with the mono-pyrolysis of CG to 26.32×10−4%3·min−2·°C−3 with the co-pyrolysis of 10 % CG and 90 % PE. The co-pyrolysis of 70 % CG and 30 % PE (CP73) achieved a lower activation energy than did the mono-pyrolysis of the two fuels. The products of the CG pyrolysis included a large number of alcohols, ethers, ketones, esters, and other oxygen-containing compounds, with a proportion as high as 65.01 %. The products of CP73 at 550 °C resulted in the yields of hydrocarbons and alcohols up to 93.61 %, beneficial to the further utilization of the co-pyrolytic products. Not only did the co-pyrolysis valorize its products, but also it enhanced their co-circularity. Artificial neural network-based joint optimization showed CP73 in the range of 517–1000 °C as the best combination of the conditions. The study provides new insights into the co-pyrolytic disposal of spent coffee grounds and polyethylene so as to improve the waste stream reduction and the valorization of energy and products.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and spent coffee grounds, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent performance, kinetic analysis, and product composition characterized by GC–MS."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene in a conical spouted bed reactor The catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) on a HY zeolite catalyst has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) at 500°C, and individual products have been monitored with the aim of obtaining product distribution data. The CSBR does not have defluidization problems in the pyrolysis of plastics. The 69wt% of the product stream corresponds to the gasoline fraction (C5–C10). It is noteworthy that this fraction fulfils European Union requirements for commercial gasoline and its RON index, 96.5, is of the same order as standard automotive fuel. The remaining products are mainly gases, especially propylene and butenes, although there is also a heavy fraction consisting of aromatics with more than one ring and unreacted waxes.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"Co-pyrolysis of cellulose and polyethylene terephthalate by TG-MS: Pyrolysis behavior, conventional gas and solid phase product characteristics This research investigates the mechanism of co-pyrolysis in waste-blended textiles (polyester/cotton blends). Thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry analysis were utilized to study the mass loss behavior and gas emission characteristics of cellulose (CE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with various mass ratios during pyrolysis. The EA, BET and FTIR analysis were used to investigate the interaction among the solid phase products. The findings revealed a clear synergistic effect between CE and PET. When the theoretical and actual thermogravimetry/gas release curves were compared, the synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis process inhibited a release of small volatile substances (H2, CH4, C2H2, CO and CO2) at high temperatures and directly promoted hydrocarbon enrichment in solid products, which could affect the adsorption performance of solid phase products, and the inhibition effect was strongest when the ratio was 35:65.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PET) and cellulose, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization including FTIR, BET, and TG-MS."
"Experimental investigation to identify the type of waste plastic pyrolysis oil suitable for conversion to diesel engine fuel Plastics for various applications is increasing every year due to outstanding advantages, but after use recycling and disposal have remained a challenge. In this paper, through experiments, we compare properties of pyrolysis oil derived from after use HDPE (High-density polyethylene), LDPE (Low-density polyethylene), PP (Polypropylene)and styrene for their suitability as diesel engine fuel. This experimental study is to identify which type of plastic is suitable for blending with diesel. The physicochemical properties of pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene were tested, tabulated and compared with diesel. The physicochemical properties of polypropylene pyrolysis oil (PPO) were found to be superior to the produced pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, and styrene. The GC-MS(Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)and FT-IR (Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy) were taken for pyrolysis oil of HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene and compared with diesel. PPO showed lower carbon number chain compounds compared to the other three waste plastics. We selected PPO for diesel engine performance and emission trials based on the results of the above tests. PPO was blended in the ratios of 5%, 10% and 15% with diesel. Combustion analysis showed a increase in cylinder pressure in comparison to diesel values. The heat release rates (HRR) were sharply higher than diesel. Both cylinder pressure and HRRvalues for PPO increased as the blend ratios increased. The emission results showed an increase in carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC)and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx)emissions. The multiple times increase in emissions is due to the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons and higher carbon number of saturated compounds in PPO. GC-MS tests confirmed the presence of such compounds in PPO. To reduce the unsaturation to negligible levels, we will take up future experiments in hydrogenating PPO with various catalysts and test the performance and emissions in diesel engines.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, and styrene) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization (GC-MS, FT-IR), and performance data from diesel engine tests."
"Upcycling WEEE plastics into dehalogenated and aromatics-rich oil by hydropyrolysis over Pd-supported catalysts This work explores low-pressure catalytic hydropyrolysis for upcycling plastics from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Three Pd-based catalysts (using Al2O3, n-ZSM-5, and SiO2 as supports) were investigated. Experiments were performed in a custom-made reactor operating at 550 °C / 350 °C in the thermal / catalytic zones, respectively, under 50 vol% H2/N2 as the carrier / reactive gas and at 6 bar. The main product was the oil fraction (yields over 65 wt%), having a high concentration of valuable aromatic hydrocarbons, coming mainly from ABS and PS polymers contained in the raw WEEE plastics. Among the three catalysts, Pd/SiO2 exhibited the best performance, sharply reducing the Cl content in the oil and achieving complete Br removal. A reference test with pure SiO2 indicated that the support alone possesses some halogen trapping capacity, although in quite lower extension than the Pd/SiO2 catalyst. The incorporation of Pd into the silica support enhanced both the oil dehalogenation and the conversion of oligomeric/heavy species, which is reflected in an increase in the GC-MS detected components. Therefore, these results denote that WEEE plastics hydropyrolysis over Pd/SiO2 catalyst is an effective treatment for the upgrading and dehalogenation of the so-produced oil fraction.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic hydropyrolysis of waste plastics from WEEE, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of oil composition."
"Products characterization study of a slow pyrolysis of biomass-plastic mixtures in a fixed-bed reactor In this study, co-pyrolysis of plastic wastes; polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with different agricultural wastes such as cotton stalk, hazelnut shells, and sunflower residues near an arid land plant Euphorbia rigida was investigated. Thermal behaviors of raw materials were investigated by using thermogravimetric analyzer. Experiments were conducted at a heating rate of 10°Cmin−1 from room temperature to 800°C in the presence of N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 100cm3 min−1. In the light of the experimental results, an appropriate temperature for the fixed-bed pyrolysis of biomass-plastic mixtures at (1/1, w/w) was determined and the raw materials were pyrolyzed at the same conditions except until the final temperature of 500°C. Solid product (char) and liquid product (tar) of the pyrolysis were characterized by using different types of characterization techniques. Pyrolysis experiments showed that mixing by biomass and plastic materials had a positive effect on the liquid and gas yields. In addition, the characterization studies showed that biomass and plastic materials could be used to convert into valuable chemicals.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVC, PET) mixed with biomass, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastic mixtures using HZSM-5 The catalytic effect of HZSM-5 zeolite was studied on the thermal decomposition of model waste mixtures of plastics (composed of PE, PP, and PET) and biomass (composed of newspaper, cardboard, and pine sawdust). The influence of temperature and catalyst ratio as well as the hindering effect of cellulose and lignin on the catalytic decomposition of plastic waste were studied applying analytical pyrolysis at low and high heating rate by thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), respectively. The products of laboratory scale batch pyrolysis and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis were analyzed in details and compared. HZSM-5 catalyst reduced the thermal stability of plastic waste, but the catalytic effect was blocked when 50% cellulose or 10% lignin were mixed in the plastic waste. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to reveal correlations between the composition of pyrolysis products, pyrolysis temperature and proportion of the applied catalyst. It was established that the hindering effect of biomass could be compensated by applying higher catalyst ratio. In a batch reactor, the use of HZSM-5 catalyst led to a significant increase in the yields of volatiles (both gases and pyrolysis oil); moreover aromatization or isomerization effects have been observed. Aromatic compounds were produced to a reduced extent by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass-containing plastic waste compared to that of plastic waste indicating that the cellulose and lignin components of the waste lower the HZSM-5 catalyst activity.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PET) with HZSM-5 catalyst, reports measurable product yields, and includes analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in the presence of activated carbon in conventional and microwave heating using modified thermocouple Pyrolysis process was experimented using two types of heating source, namely conventional and microwave. Polystyrene (PS) plastic waste was used as feedstock in a batch reactor for both the conventional (slow pyrolysis) and microwave pyrolysis. The effect of activated carbon to polystyrene ratio on (i) yield of oil, gas and residues (ii) reaction temperature (iii) reaction time were studied. Quality of oil from pyrolysis of polystyrene were assessed for the possible applicability in fuel production. Microwave power of 450 W and polymer to activated carbon ratio of 10:1, resulted in the highest oil yield of 93.04 wt.% with a higher heating value of 45 MJ kg−1 and a kinematic viscosity of 2.7 cSt. Microwave heating when compared to conventional heating method, exhibits a reaction temperature and time of 330 °C in 5.5 min, whereas in conventional heating system it was 418 °C in 60 min. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of liquid oil from microwave pyrolysis predominantly yields alkenes of 8.44 wt.%, α-methyl styrene 0.96 wt.%, condensed ring aromatics 23.21 wt.% and benzene derivatives 26.77 wt.% when the polystyrene to activated carbon ratio was 10:1. Significant factor of using microwave heating is the amount of energy converted (kWh) is lesser than conventional heating.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene waste using both conventional and microwave heating with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of oil composition."
"Microwave-assisted decomposition of waste plastic over Fe/FeAl2O4 to produce hydrogen and carbon nanotubes This study experimentally investigated a novel approach for producing hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via high-density polyethylene (HDPE) cracking using Fe/FeAl2O4 under microwave radiation. We tested catalyst performance at different Fe-FeAl2O4 ratios and under different microwave powers and characterized. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM, Raman, and TGA techniques. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the structural properties of the catalysts and their activities. The results showed that Fe/FeAl2O4 catalyst can efficiently crack plastics into hydrogen and CNTs with the assistance of microwaves, and the catalyst with 30 wt% Fe loading exhibited optimal microwave absorption and catalytic activity. The hydrogen production is 47.03 mmol/gplastic (84.96 vol%). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of microwaves on catalysts by simulating the electromagnetic field distribution, finding that the material was heated in the form of eddy current loss. CNTs follow different growth mechanisms on Fe and FeAl2O4 in the catalyst, namely the tip growth mechanism and the base growth mechanism, respectively.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste HDPE plastic, with measurable hydrogen yield, CNT production, catalyst performance evaluation, and experimental characterization using XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM, Raman, and TGA."
"Dechlorination during pyrolysis of plastics: The potential of stepwise pyrolysis in combination with metal sorbents Pyrolysis liquid is a valuable product that could be re-introduced into the refinery or petrochemical industry following circular economy principles. However, halogens in the liquid product hinder this approach by causing corrosion of subsequent technologies. Dehalogenation is, therefore, a necessary step that aims to reduce halogen content below the set limit of 10 ppm. Research on this topic often includes contradictory results, and dehalogenation is still not widely used in large-scale operations. The present study explores the possibility of chlorine removal from a model plastic mixture, including 10% PVC utilizing various pyrolysis conditions, stepwise pyrolysis, and sorbents based on Ca(OH)2, Fe3O4, and Fe. Results suggest that it is not suitable to use sorbents in-situ as the captured Cl in the form of chlorides was released at higher temperatures increasing the chlorine content in the liquid products. The limit of 10 ppm for refinery introduction was reached by combining stepwise pyrolysis and sorbents ex-situ. Fe3O4 displayed the best efficiency, while its reduced form was the most efficient considering its low surface area. The obtained results are a necessary preliminary step for the development of a reliable dehalogenation procedure for municipal plastic waste being underway.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of a plastic mixture containing PVC, with measurable results on chlorine removal efficiency, sorbent performance, and product composition under controlled conditions."
"Enhancing aromatics and olefins yields in thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE over zeolites: Role of staged catalysis and acid site density of HZSM-5 The present work deals with the thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE (low-density polyethylene) in lab-scale one- and two-stage test rigs over HZSM-5 catalysts featuring different acid site densities. In the first part of this work, the influence of catalyst-to-feed ratio and temperature (in conjunction with the acid site density of HZSM-5) on the product distribution was studied with an aim to identify the optimum operating conditions for the enhanced production of aromatics and light olefins. For this purpose, one-stage thermo-catalytic pyrolysis was performed in which catalysts were mixed with LDPE pellets for in-situ catalysis. In the one-stage catalytic pyrolysis, the catalyst sample with the highest acid site density gave the highest concentration of aromatics (ca. 55%) in the pyrolysis oil with a mono-aromatics fraction of over 50% that consisted mainly of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) compounds. The highest C2-C4 olefins concentration (ca. 65%) in the pyrolysis gas was obtained when the sample with the lowest acid site density was used. In the two-stage catalytic pyrolysis (ex-situ catalysis), the concentration of aromatics in the pyrolysis oil reached over 77% with a mono-aromatics fraction of ca. 72% that contained mainly BTEX compounds, when the most acidic catalyst was used. When the catalyst with the lowest number of strong acid sites was employed, the high content of C2-C4 olefins in the pyrolysis gas remained almost independent of the reactor configuration. These findings might provide important new insights for the chemical recycling of plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE waste plastic with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis using staged catalysis and varying acid site densities."
"Integrating PET chemical recycling with pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste via pressureless alkaline depolymerization in a hydrocarbon solvent This study presents a proof of concept for a technology train that integrates polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recovery from mixed plastic waste and plastic pyrolysis. PET is depolymerized into terephthalic acid (TPA) by hydrolysis using a low volatility oil as medium, which enables (i) low-pressure operation, and (ii) a selective separation and recovery of TPA from the product mix by a simple process of filtration, washing, and precipitation. Full PET conversion and high TPA recovery (>98 %) were achieved at 260 °C. This technology train is demonstrated to be effective for processing mixed waste streams, leading to higher yield and quality of liquid product from thermal pyrolysis when compared with feedstock that has not been pre-treated. Further, the technology could be readily integrated with a plastics pyrolysis process, whereby a by-product from the pyrolysis could be used as the low-volatility oil.",The study involves pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste and includes experimental data on product yields and process conditions.
"Pyrolysis of a fraction of mixed plastic wastes depleted in PVC A fraction of plastic wastes from DSD (Duales System Deutschland) which is depleted in polyvinylchloride (PVC) was pyrolyzed at 638, 690 and 735°C in a technical-scale fluidized bed reactor. At 638°C over 50 wt.% of the pyrolysis product was an oil with a boiling point less than 295°C; this can be used as feedstock in a steam cracker. The experiment at 690°C yielded about 40 wt.% of an oil, about the half of which consists of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX-aromatics). At the highest reaction temperature of 735°C, the main product was a highly aromatized oil; the BTX-aromatics content is about 20 wt.% of the pyrolysis product.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields and compositional analysis at specific temperatures.
"Catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in continuous mode over zeolite catalysts in a conical spouted bed reactor A study has been carried out using HZSM-5, HY and Hβ zeolite-based catalysts in the pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) continuously fed into a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) at 500°C and atmospheric pressure, with the aim being to assess the yields and composition of the main products (both light olefins and automotive fuel hydrocarbons). Product streams have been grouped into seven lumps: light olefins (C2–C4) and light alkanes (<C4) in the gas fraction, the liquid fraction consisting of three lumps (non-aromatic C5–C11 compounds, single-ring aromatics and C11+ hydrocarbons), wax and coke. The results are compared with those already obtained in thermal pyrolysis in a CSBR and with those obtained in the literature using catalysts in bubbling fluidized beds. HZSM-5 zeolite-based catalyst is very selective to light olefins, ≈58wt% once equilibrated; whereas high yields of non-aromatic C5–C11 products (around 45wt%) are obtained with Hβ and HY zeolite-based catalysts. Wax yield increases as reactions proceed, especially with HY and Hβ zeolite-based catalysts, due to catalyst deactivation by coke formation. Product distribution with the different catalysts and their evolution throughout continuous operation by feeding HDPE is explained according to the different properties of the zeolites used.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Influence of the conditions for reforming HDPE pyrolysis volatiles on the catalyst deactivation by coke Pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor (500°C) and the volatiles have been reformed in-line over a Ni commercial catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor. The evolution of reaction indices (conversion, H2 yield and other gaseous product yields) with time on stream has been studied under the following operating conditions: temperature, 600–700°C; space-time, 8.3–20.8gcat mingHDPE −1, and steam/plastic ratio, 3–5. High initial conversion (>94.5%) and H2 yields (>76.7%) are attained under all the operating conditions studied, with HDPE conversion and H2 yield increasing when the three variables are increased, which is explained by the enhancement of the reforming reaction. However, a significant effect of operating conditions on catalyst stability has been observed. Thus, an increase in temperature, space-time and steam/plastic ratio decreases catalyst deactivation as a consequence of a lower rate of coke deposition on the catalyst due to both a lower C5+ coke precursor amount in the reaction medium and a higher gasification rate of the coke deposited.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor followed by in-line reforming over a Ni catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance data."
"MS study of the gases evolved in the pyrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers comparison between thermal and catalytic processes In this work, a fixed bed reactor connected to a mass spectrometer (MS) has been used to carry out a qualitative study of the evolution of the gases evolved in the pyrolysis of two commercial ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers (with 13 and 27.5% of vinyl acetate, respectively). The catalyst used was MCM-41 prepared by a two-step sol–gel method, in acid medium, at room temperature. Pure copolymer samples and mixtures of copolymer with around 10% of MCM-41 catalyst were pyrolysed in an He atmosphere at a heating rate of 10K/min. Once the less volatile compounds condensed, the gas evolved was analysed by MS. The study of the total ion current (TIC) curves as well as the evolution with time of the ions selected as representative of several compounds or groups of compounds confirm the existence of the two reaction steps suggested in the bibliography for the second stage of EVA pyrolysis: cracking of the polyethylene domains and cracking of the polyene domains, both domain types resulting from the first decomposition stage. On the other hand, the analysis and comparison of the evolution of the intensity of current corresponding to the selected mass ions in the thermal and catalytic processes show that the gas evolved always contains a higher amount of olefines than alkanes and that more conversion to gaseous products is obtained in the presence of the catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of commercial ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable gas evolution data, catalyst performance comparison, and analytical characterization via mass spectrometry."
"Characterization of the liquid product recovered through pyrolysis of PMMA–ABS waste Thermal decomposition of waste polymethylmethacrylate–acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (PMMA–ABS) blend has been carried out using analytical and lab-scale pyrolysis methods in order to identify the substantial components appearing in the liquid product. Additionally decomposition characteristics of the blend have been investigated regarding the possible interrelation between the two components during the pyrolysis. The interactions between PMMA and ABS seem to modify the decomposition characteristics of the ABS, resulting in a lower degradation temperature than that of pure ABS. Moreover the simultaneous decomposition results in recombination of the products yielding new volatile compounds. During batch pyrolysis relatively high amount of gas production was observed, that is in contradiction with the results obtained by analytical pyrolysis and the data found in the literature where pyrolysis of the PMMA as well as the ABS was reported to yield low amount of gas products. The liquid product retrieved from thermal decomposition has been analyzed with respect to the possible utilization as a propellant. Hence aside from the investigation of contained elements and compounds, determination of density, viscosity, research octane number (RON), calorific value, and gaseous emissions has been carried out as well. The relatively high yield (65wt%), and outstanding compression tolerance (RON=110.2) observed at the pyrolysis oil make it a feasible fuel admixture.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PMMA–ABS plastics, reports measurable product yields (65wt%), and provides detailed experimental characterization including fuel properties like RON, calorific value, and viscosity."
"Tertiary recycling of polyethylene waste by fluidised-bed reactions in the presence of various cracking catalysts A mixture of post-consumer polyethylene waste (HDPE/LDPE) was pyrolyzed over various catalysts using a fluidised-bed reactor operating in the 290–430°C range under atmospheric pressure. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolitic catalysts (HZSM-5>HUSY>HMOR) gave higher yield than non-zeolitic catalysts (SAHA≈MCM-41). Observed differences in product yields and product distributions can be attributed to the nature of catalyst and the reaction temperature. Product distributions with HZSM-5 contained more olefinic materials with about 60wt% in the range of C3–C5. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffinic streams with large amounts of isobutane (i-C4) and both catalysts deactivated during the course of the degradation. MCM-41 and SAHA showed the lowest conversion and generated an olefin-rich product with a rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. The selectivity could be influenced by the change in reaction condition with the olefins and iso-olefins produced by low temperatures. A kinetic model based on a lumping reaction scheme for the observed products and catalyst deactivation has been investigated. The model gave a good representation of experiment results. It is demonstrated that under appropriate reaction temperatures and suitable catalysts can have the ability to control both the product yield and product distribution from polymer degradation, potentially leading to a cheaper process with more valuable products.","The study involves lab-scale fluidised-bed pyrolysis of post-consumer polyethylene waste with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Effect of Cl/Ni molar ratio on the catalytic conversion of polypropylene into Cu–Ni/C composites and their application in catalyzing “Click” reaction A one-pot approach to prepare Cu–Ni/C heterogeneous composites by carbonization of polypropylene (PP) using combined catalysts of Ni2O3 and CuCl was proposed. TEM, SEM, TGA and Raman measurements were performed to investigate the effects of Cl/Ni molar ratios on the yield and morphology of the resultant carbon materials. The yield of carbon materials in Cu–Ni/C first increased and then decreased as the Cl/Ni molar ratio increased, and the maximum yield was achieved at Cl/Ni molar ratio of 0.125. Longer and thinner carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were obtained at low Cl/Ni ratios while shorter carbon fibers were formed at high Cl/Ni ratios. The effect of Cl/Ni molar ratio on the active sites for the growth of carbon materials and degraded products of PP were investigated by XRD, GC and GC–MS. Interestingly, the resultant Cu–Ni/C showed the catalysis to “Click” reaction. As a result, the initial catalytic substances (Ni2O3 and CuCl) could be effectively used twice as catalysts in the carbonization of PP and in the later application of the resultant Cu–Ni/C composites. More importantly, this approach is a new potential method to transform waste polymer materials into valuable metal/carbon heterogeneous composites.","The study involves pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) in a lab-scale carbonization process with measurable yields, catalyst effects, and product characterization using GC–MS, XRD, and other analytical techniques."
"Synthesis and characterization of sulfonated activated carbon as a catalyst for bio-jet fuel production from biomass and waste plastics Sulfonated activated carbon-based catalysts were prepared by microwaved-assisted carbonization of phosphoric acid activated corncob followed by sulfonation using concentrated sulfuric acid. Sulfonation at different temperatures and times resulted in varied SO3H group density of the SAC catalysts. Sulfonation temperature showed a significant effect on the introduction of SO3H on the AC precursor while time had minor role. The SAC catalysts were characterized by means of N2 sorption analysis (specific surface area, pore-volume, average pore width), FTIR spectroscopy, SEM imaging, and sulfur analysis. The impact of catalysts SO3H density on the product distribution and bio-oil composition from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir and LDPE was evaluated. The highest bio-jet fuels (aromatics and C9-16 alkanes) obtained was 97.51% using the SAC catalyst sulfonated at 100 °C for 5 h. Results showed that SAC has great potential as catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics for the production of jet-fuel range hydrocarbons.","The study involves catalytic co-pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) and biomass, with measurable product yields and composition analysis, including bio-jet fuel production from plastic and biomass feedstocks."
"Production of aviation fuel via thermal cracking of plastic waste Despite the calorific value of plastic waste being comparable to that of fossil fuels, its direct utilisation in the internal combustion engine is not a viable option due to a technical difficulty in optimising the equivalence ratio. To address this issue, this study proposes a pyrolysis system for the conversion of plastic waste, especially high density polyethylene (HDPE), into liquid fuels compatible with aircraft turbojet engines. Given a broad spectrum of pyrogenic hydrocarbons (HCs) derived from HDPE, it is important to shorten the chain length to produce aviation fuel-like products with carbon numbers ranging from 8 to 16. To this end, this study modified the typical pyrolysis setup by additionally adopting a heating element, isothermally operated at 500–800 °C. Also, the condensation system for collecting the pyrogenic HCs was designed using two consecutive units (set as 20 and −40 °C) for the selective recovery of jet-fuel-range HCs. The reaction temperature of 600 °C exhibited the similar composition of HDPE-derived fuel with commercial aviation fuels (Jet-A, JP-8, and JP-5). Subsequently, thermodynamic calculations of HCs collected in the second trap were performed in an ideal turbojet engine cycle. It was confirmed that the fuel performances of HDPE-derived fuel (produced at 600 °C) were comparable to commercial ones. Therefore, this study proposed that modification of pyrolysis and condensation system facilitated the production of jet-fuel-range HCs derived from HDPE.","The study involves lab-scale thermal cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic waste, with measured temperature–yield relationships, product composition analysis, and experimental validation of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons."
"Feedstock recycling of polyethylene in a two-step thermo-catalytic reaction system The conversion of low density polyethylene (LDPE) into high value hydrocarbons has been investigated using a two-step reaction system consisting of an initial pyrolytic furnace followed by an independent reactor containing nanosized n-HZSM-5 zeolite or Al-MCM-41 mesostructured material where the catalytic reforming of the pyrolytic vapours took place. The system was run at temperatures between 425 and 475°C and the results compared with those obtained in the absence of catalyst. Temperatures of 450°C and above were required to reach conversion values in excess of 90wt%. At that temperature and in the absence of catalysts, thermal cracking of LDPE generated almost exclusively α-olefins and n-paraffins over a wide range of molecular weights, most of which (74.7wt%) collected as liquid products. Catalytic reforming over n-HZSM-5 was effective at 425°C and caused a significant increase in the proportion of gaseous hydrocarbons (73.5wt% selectivity at 450°C) that consisted primarily of olefins. The remaining liquid products contained a high proportion of valuable aromatic and branched species in the gasoline size range (C5–C12) making it suitable for blending with commercial gasolines. Owing to its weaker acid properties, catalytic reforming over Al-MCM-41 required the use of higher temperatures (450°C and above) to produce a lower proportion of gas products (54–58wt%) but a consequently higher amount of liquid (34–42wt%) hydrocarbons. Besides, formation of aromatics was less significant than with n-HZSM5, but the resulting oils contained a good combination of olefins and iso-paraffins. This product composition is comparable to commercial transportation fuel.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using a two-step thermo-catalytic system with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"CO2 enhanced continuous microwave pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene to produce high-quality products: Energy recovery balance and intrinsic mechanism exploration The utilization of microwave pyrolysis technology and CO2 dry reforming to recover high-quality products from waste plastics has become a research hotspot. In this work, light fuels were recovered by CO2-enhanced continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The balanced relationship between CO2 utilization and energy recovery was investigated, and the intrinsic pyrolysis mechanism was analyzed. Increasing the pyrolysis temperatures and CO2 concentrations helped to increase the pyrolysis gas yield and the syngas content, which were 96.44 wt% and 65.61 vol%, respectively. CO2 enhanced the CMP degree of LDPE and reacted with intermediates to form oxygen-containing intermediates to produce high-quality products and release CO, thereby regulating the syngas content and H2/CO ratio (0.62–3.99). Although an increase in CO2 concentration enhanced CO2 utilization efficiency, it reduced energy recovery efficiency by increasing energy consumption. The efficiencies of CO2 utilization and energy recovery could reach 81.69% and 75.29% at pyrolysis conditions of 650 °C-75 vol% CO2 and 650 °C-25 vol% CO2, respectively. Appropriate CO2 concentration (25 vol%) was the key to synergistically improving product quality, resource utilization, and energy recovery. This work evaluated the potential of CO2-enhanced CMP to produce high-quality products and provided novel insights for improving the resource utilization efficiency of waste plastics and CO2.","The study involves lab-scale microwave pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst/CO2 effect analysis."
"Enhancing the performance of a PtPd/HY catalyst for HDPE/VGO hydrocracking through zeolite desilication The valorization of post-consumer waste plastic in a refinery is an attractive initiative to avoid environmental problems caused by the poor plastic waste management. The modification of a bifunctional PtPd/HY catalyst through desilication (using NaOH) of the ultrastable HY zeolite has been carried out to upgrade waste plastic (high-density polyethylene (HDPE)) dissolved in a secondary refinery stream (vacuum gas oil (VGO)) through hydrocracking. Three different catalysts have been studied: the parent (Cat-A), undergoing a desilication cycle (Cat-B), and subjected to two cycles of desilication (Cat-C). The characterization techniques employed have been: N2 adsorption–desorption, TEM, ICP-AES, tert-butylamine-TPD, pyridine FTIR, WDXRF, XRD and TPO. The hydrocracking tests have been carried out in a semi-batch reactor at: 440 °C; 80 bar; catalyst to feed ratio, 0.1 gcat (gfeed)–1; HDPE to feed ratio, 0.2 gHDPE (gfeed)–1; and reaction time, 2 h. The products have been fractioned according to their boiling point range in: gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The composition of each fraction has been determined in terms of concentration of paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and (mono-, di- and poly-) aromatics. The results show that alkaline treated catalysts enhance the fuel production, with high HDPE and HCO conversions. The Cat-C (the one submitted to two desilication cycles) has displayed the greatest performance, reducing by half the gas yield and increasing the naphtha yield by 51 wt% respect to those obtained with the parent catalyst (Cat-A). Moreover, it has decreased the coke deposition and the coke formed has been less developed.","The study involves lab-scale hydrocracking of HDPE waste plastic in a semi-batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Evaluation of temperature role in the HDPE steam cracking product distribution with a focus on light olefins production The selective conversion of waste plastics into valuable chemicals, such as light olefins and single ring aromatics, was approached in an original fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor. The aim was the evaluation of the role played by temperature on product distribution and reaction mechanism in the steam cracking of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). Therefore, continuous runs were conducted between 675 and 800 ºC using a bed made up of inert sand. The reactor operated under vigorous spouting conditions to promote gas-solid contact and, at the same time, reduce the gas residence time. The proposed reactor design performs very well and is highly versatile to operate in a wide temperature range without operational problems. The steam cracking at 675 ºC led to partial conversion with a high oil fraction (44.9 wt%). The maximum yield of light olefins of 54.5 wt% was obtained at 700 ºC, with this yield steadily decreasing as temperature was increased. Cracking temperature had also an influence on the light olefin composition, with a marked decrease in the content of propylene and butenes and an increase in that of ethylene when temperature was raised. In addition, high temperatures also promoted the production of valuable single ring aromatics, i.e., a Benzene, Toluene and Xylenes (BTX) fraction yield of approximately 16 wt% was obtained between 750 and 800 ºC. Therefore, steam cracking in a fountain confined spouted bed reactor is an encouraging strategy to selectively convert plastics into valuable chemicals, such as light olefins and BTX aromatic compounds.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic in a spouted bed reactor, with measured product yields and temperature–yield relationships for light olefins and BTX aromatics."
"Metallised seaweed-derived bio-char catalyst preparation and its application in the pyrolysis process for the waste fishing nets and marine biomass utilisation Marine biomass and plastic wastes are one of the most significant ecological issues of water pools, which could be adapted for energy recovery through pyrolysis. Moreover, a catalytical process could be applied to improve the quality and adaptability of the formed product. This study investigates seaweed (SWD) and fishing nets (FN) standalone pyrolysis with and without commercial ZSM-5 catalysts. Therefore, the newly created seaweed char-based metals (iron and copper) impregnated catalysts were investigated using SEM-EDS, XRD, and pore size distribution examination and applied for the selected feedstock pyrolysis process. The study revealed that bio-char contains 335 m2/g of surface area, while the impregnation process increased it to 1066 and 790 m2/g with copper and iron, respectively. Pyrolysis products investigation showed that the main derivatives of the FN liquid fraction are caprolactam and hexanenitrile, while the SWD liquids mainly consist of variously substituted aromatic and phenolic compounds. Copper-impregnated catalyst increased the amount of caprolactam to 54.3 % and hexanenitrile to 31.7 % (FN), while the amount of toluene was increased to 84.2 % (SWD) in the total liquid fraction.

"Waste surgical masks to fuels via thermochemical co-processing with waste motor oil and biomass In this work, the co-processing of waste surgical masks, waste motor oil, and biomass was investigated to reduce the environmental impacts of the increasing medical-derived plastic pollution as well as to elucidate its effect on the production of chemicals . The results showed high yields towards an oily product with an interesting hydrocarbon content in the diesel range. Furthermore, although the initial waste motor oil had a high sulfur content, the oily products showed a low sulfur content, that was logically distributed in the solid and gas phases. In addition, all oily products presented HHVs ​​higher than 44 MJ/Kg, with cetane indices, densities, and viscosities lower than those of petroleum-derived diesel. This work could impact on the management of waste surgical masks and the joint recovery of everyday waste towards high value-added products.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste surgical masks (a plastic waste) in co-processing with waste motor oil and biomass, yielding oil with measurable properties such as HHV, sulfur content, and hydrocarbon composition, indicating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"Hydrogen production by catalytic upgrading of volatiles from pyrolysis of fibre-reinforced plastic waste The upgrading of the volatiles coming from the pyrolysis of fibre-reinforced plastic waste is studied in this work. The experiments have been carried out in a lab-scale installation composed of two reactor connected in series, in order to pyrolyse the sample in the first reactor and upgrade the volatiles in the second one. The pyrolysis has been carried out at 500 °C and the upgrading has been conducted at 900 °C in the presence of a pre-reforming catalyst, a H2S sorbent, the both of them and none of them. The results show that the upgrading step is required to eliminate the complex pyrolysis oils generated with this type of waste and to enhance the production and improve the composition of the gases. The pre-reforming catalyst increases the performance of the upgrading step, providing a hydrogen yield of 57.8 %. The H2S sorbent is able to eliminate the 80 % of the H2S and allows the better performance of the catalyst, yielding the highest gas production (10.4 wt%), hydrogen concentration (53.5 vol%), syngas concentration (75.5 vol%), and hydrogen yield (69.3 %).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of fibre-reinforced plastic waste with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis at defined temperatures."
"Parametric study on catalytic cracking of LDPE to liquid fuel over ZSM-5 zeolite Pyrolysis or cracking of plastic waste is considered as a potential solution to the environmental problems brought about by plastic waste, with the production of hydrocarbon fuel as a value added benefit. In order to explore the potentials of such process, parametric study have been conducted on the catalytic cracking of LDPE dissolved in benzene in a fixed bed reactor. The five factors studied were temperature (A), catalyst mass (B), feed flow rate (C), carrier gas flow rate (D), as well as concentration of LDPE solution (E), while the responses were LDPE conversion (Y1) and liquid yield (Y2). The parametric study showed that four out of five factors (A, B, C and D) have significant effects on Y1 and Y2. The optimum conditions that produced maximum responses for Y1 and Y2 simultaneously are 600°C (A), 0.10g catalyst (B), 1ml/s LDPE solution (C), 80ml/minN2 flow (D). The numerical values for Y1 and Y2 were 98.6% and 99.5%, respectively. Analysis on products composition indicated that catalytic cracking of LDPE in fixed bed reaction generally produced high amount of aliphatic branched-chain compounds, together with moderate amount of cyclic compounds. Aromatization of LDPE cracking products is less due to the short retention time of the compounds on the catalysts bed.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE waste plastic in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Aquathermolysis of polyolefin plastic wastes over a MOF-derived TiO2 anatase catalyst: Enhancing C–N bond cleavage and coke suppression Plastics are ubiquitous in modern society owing to their cost-effectiveness, low weight, and durability. However, the disposal and recycling of plastic waste remain significant challenges. Aquathermolysis has emerged as a promising strategy for converting contaminant-rich polyolefin plastic waste into value-added liquid fuels. This study investigates the plastic-waste aquathermolysis potential of a TiO2 catalyst derived from the sacrificial precursor Ti-containing MIL-125 via a MOF-mediated synthesis pathway combined with calcination. The TiO2 catalyst retained its mesoporous properties and predominantly anatase phase on calcination at 450 ℃. The aquathermolysis catalysis and stability of the newly synthesized catalyst for plastic-waste conversion were evaluated and compared with those of other catalytic systems. Additionally, the role of water in the N removal efficiency and coke suppression properties of the catalyst were analyzed. Water significantly improved the removal of N and S impurities, with a N reduction of 80–95% at the optimal water content (20–40 wt%). The robustness of the as-synthesized catalyst was confirmed by deconvoluted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy patterns, which indicated the persistence of the TiO2 phase, even after prolonged catalysis in aqueous environments, and transmission electron microscopy results, which showed that the anatase phase remained well-dispersed under aquathermolysis conditions with a significant reduction in the C/Ti ratio and a corresponding increment in the N/C ratio. The results of this study could guide future research on the development of catalysts, similar to the MIL-125-derived TiO2 catalyst investigated here, with high potential for efficient plastic-waste conversion and impurity removal in aqueous environments.","The study involves lab-scale aquathermolysis of polyolefin plastic waste using a MOF-derived TiO2 catalyst, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including XPS and TEM."
"A strategic recovery of value-added monomer from polycarbonate waste through catalytic pyrolysis on ultra-high porous MgO The huge generation of plastic waste has become significant environmental problem. For environmentally sustainable plastic waste management, thermochemical recycling of widely used plastic waste such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate have vigorously studied. However, development of proper recycling process for other types of plastic waste is required. In this study, a thermo-catalytic treatment was applied for recovery of value-added monomers and gaseous products from polycarbonate (PC). The systematic study investigating the relationships between pyrolysis conditions (temperature, atmospheric gas, the presence of catalyst) and yield of value-added products was performed. To make the thermochemical process environmentally benign and more efficient, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as an atmospheric gas in comparing to inert gas (N2). When CO2 was introduced, the yield of PC monomer, bisphenol A (BPA), was nearly doubled at 600 °C. At higher temperature, BPA yield decreased with the increased yield of gaseous products. Because CO2 was the major gaseous product, BPA recovery from the PC pyrolysis was the useful approach in PC disposal practice. To improve BPA yield from PC pyrolysis, two MgO catalysts were utilized (medium porosity MgO-1 and ultrahigh porosity MgO-2). Catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 environment increased BPA yield from 12.8 (pyrolysis without catalyst under N2) to 25.6 (MgO-1) and 30.5 wt% (MgO-2) at 600 °C. High porosity MgO catalyst was more effective in BPA production, and the catalyst deactivation was not shown for 4 consecutive reactions. This study informs that MgO catalyst and CO2 flow gas more than doubled the BPA yield from pyrolysis of PC in reference to conventional pyrolysis system (non-catalytic under N2).","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polycarbonate waste, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance data."
"Deactivation by coking of industrial ZSM-5 catalysts used in LDPE pyrolysis and regeneration by ozonation process – Bench scale studies Study of the catalytic deactivation during successive uses of ZSM-5 catalysts in bench-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (200:20 g LDPE:ZSM-5) has been carried out in a semi-batch reactor at 450 °C. The correlation between coke formation over catalyst properties and selectivity during pyrolysis is observed. The loss of catalytic performances translates into a significant drop of aromatics and an increase of waxes in pyrolysis products. The observed deactivation is due to the formation of heavy coke over the catalysts, causing surface hindering, porosity blockage and acid sites diminution. The capacity of ozonation process to regenerate such coked catalysts around 100 °C is demonstrated using a fixed bed reactor. Different times of exposure are investigated to evaluate ozonation efficiency. By using this coke oxidizing treatment during 48 h, regenerated catalysts recovered their initial textural and chemical characteristics (porous volume and acidity) as well as their catalytic performances (similar aromatics proportion as the first pyrolysis).","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, and regeneration efficiency evaluated through experimental data."
"Optimum operating conditions for a two-stage gasification process fueled by polypropylene by means of continuous reactor over ruthenium catalyst We studied fuel gas production by means of pyrolysis and steam reforming of waste plastics for applications in solid oxide fuel cells. More specifically, we evaluated the effects of pyrolytic gasification temperature, catalyst content, steam reforming temperature, and weight hourly space velocity for a Ru catalyst used in a 60gh−1-scale continuous experimental apparatus, which consisted of a tank reactor for pyrolysis and a packed-bed catalytic reactor for steam reforming. Polypropylene (PP) pellets were used as a model waste plastic. Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with two different Ru contents were investigated. To suppress residue formation, the optimum operating temperature of the pyrolyzer was 673K. To ensure suppressed coke formation, sufficient carbon conversion to gaseous products, and minimized heat loss from the reactor, the optimum operating conditions for the reformer were determined to be 903K and 0.11g-sample g-catalyst−1 h−1 with a 5wt.% Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The composition of the gas produced with the 5wt.% catalyst was almost the same as that predicted by chemical equilibrium laws, and it was applicable for a direct hydrocarbon fuel cell.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene pellets using a continuous reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under defined operating conditions."
"Pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (DKR-350): Effect of washing pre-treatment and fate of chlorine Pyrolysis of a post-consumer plastic waste stream (DKR-350) has been performed at a laboratory scale in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C. DKR-350 is a complex mixture of post-consumer plastics comprising polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, clogged materials, multilayer flexibles, together with considerable amounts of biogenic and inorganic residues and halogens. The influence of different washing procedures on feedstock composition and pyrolysis product yields was investigated. Washing effectively lowers the biogenic, inorganic and halogen contents in DKR-350, though does not affect the yield of the desired oil/wax (66 to 69 wt%). 27% of the oil/wax lies in the boiling point range of naphtha and gasoline (150 ppm), showing the presence of recalcitrant organochlorides in the feed. Thus, post-treatment is still required to upgrade it to feedstock for the production of fuels and/or chemicals.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed post-consumer plastic waste in a fixed-bed reactor with measured oil/wax yields and product composition analysis.
"In situ catalytic reforming of plastic pyrolysis vapors using MSW incineration ashes The valorization of municipal solid waste incineration bottom and fly ashes (IBA and IFA) as catalysts for thermochemical plastic treatment was investigated. As-received, calcined, and Ni-loaded ashes prepared via hydrothermal synthesis were used as low-cost waste-derived catalysts for in-line upgrading of volatile products from plastic pyrolysis. It was found that both IBA and air pollution control IFA (APC) promote selective production of BTEX compounds (i.e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) without significantly affecting the formation of other gaseous and liquid species. There was insignificant change in the product distribution when electrostatic precipitator IFA (ESP) was used, probably due to the lack of active catalytic species. Calcined APC (C-APC) demonstrated further improvement in the BTEX yield that suggested the potential to enhance the catalytic properties of ashes through pre-treatment. By comparing with the leaching limit values stated in the European Council Decision, 2003/33/EC for the acceptance of hazardous waste at landfills, all the ashes applied remained in the same category after the calcination and pyrolysis processes, except the leaching of Cl− from the ESP, which was around the borderline. Therefore, the use of ashes in catalytic reforming application do not significantly deteriorate their metal leaching behavior. Considering its superior catalytic activity towards BTEX formation, C-APC was loaded with Ni at 15 and 30 wt%. The Ni-loading favored an increase in overall oil yield, while reducing the gas yield when compared to the benchmark Ni loaded ZSM catalyst. However, Ni addition also caused the formation of more heavier hydrocarbons (C20–C35) that would require post-treatment to recover favorable products like BTEX.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of plastic waste using waste-derived catalysts, with measurable product yields, catalytic performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of tobacco stem and polypropylene over Ni/CaO-Al2O3: synergistic production and distribution of pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes Inexpensive metal oxides are the promising catalyst supports for catalytic pyrolysis to produce pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The catalytic co-pyrolysis of tobacco stem (TS) and recycled plastic (PP) is conducted using a Ni/CaO-Al2O3 catalyst with varying CaO/Al2O3 ratios (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1) in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Subsequently, TS and PP were decomposed at high temperature to produce pyrolysis oil and H2-rich pyrolysis gas, while CNTs were synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the deposited catalyst (FeMo/MgO). The results demonstrated that Ni-based dual-support catalysts exhibit high total acidity (17–110 mmol/g) and optimal reduction temperature (300–600 °C). This is conducive to improve the catalytic cracking reactivity, improve product quality, and achieve CO2 fixation. Ni/Ca-50 enhances C–H cracking, resulting in the production of hydrogen (46 %) and short-chain hydrocarbons, which is beneficial for generating higher-quality CNTs on the deposited catalyst with an ID/IG ratio of 0.52. Meanwhile, Ni/Ca-25 achieved the highest hydrocarbon content (65 %), fostering the generation of carbon source gases necessary for producing high-yield CNTs on FeMo/MgO, evidenced by a TPO weight loss of 40 %. The highly selective Ni-based dual-support catalysts hold significant potential for application in catalytic co-pyrolysis, paving the way for the widespread and large-scale deployment of pyrolysis technology.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and tobacco stem using a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis oil, gas, and carbon nanotubes."
"Energy recovery from cross-linked polyethylene wastes using pyrolysis and CO2 assisted gasification High-temperature gasification is an attractive alternative technology for clean energy production from plastic wastes and provides a sustainable pathway for their disposal. Waste cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) offers good potential energy recovery source because of its high energy density of around 47 MJ/kg that can be converted to syngas using pyrolysis or gasification. CO2 assisted gasification can provide clean and efficient syngas that can be converted further to valuable products. This can effectively decrease the carbon foot-print from the utilization of polyethylene wastes. This paper examines pyrolysis and CO2 assisted gasification of XLPE waste with focus on the kinetics, product yield and syngas yield properties (yield of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrocarbon) at different temperatures. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out to estimate the impact of the gasifying agent over pyrolysis. Pyrolysis and CO2 assisted gasification were conducted at several temperatures in the range 973 K to 1173 K in steps of 50 K. The results were compared with high-, medium-, low-density polyethylene as well as ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Higher temperatures provided increased syngas yields from pyrolysis. The activation energy of pyrolysis from single-step kinetic analysis of TGA data revealed increases with an increase in branching and cross-linking. The reaction profiles of the single step of all the samples (except medium density polyethylene) were found to be closely represented by the Avrami-Erofeev models. Results also revealed that gasification generated more syngas, hydrogen, and energy than pyrolysis. Gasification consumed the CO2 to generate syngas with a mass-specific heating value similar to natural gas suggesting efficient utilization of both CO2 and XLPEs for clean and efficient energy production.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis and CO2-assisted gasification of cross-linked polyethylene waste, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent syngas yields, and kinetic analysis using TGA data."
"Synergistic effect and chlorine migration behavior in co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polyvinyl chloride and directional chlorine enrichment using calcium oxide Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and low-rank coal is an important way to realize the recycling of plastic wastes and the clean and efficient conversion of coal. However, halogens released would cause equipment corrosion and affect tar quality when halogenated plastics were co-pyrolyzed with coal. For this reason, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as a representative of halogenated plastic, was co-pyrolyzed with Pingshuo coal (PS) in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The synergistic effect between PS and PVC and the migration behavior of chlorine were investigated, and the in-situ removal of chlorine during pyrolysis was explored by adding a CaO bed in the second stage of the reactor. The results showed that the addition of PVC in PS has a positive synergistic effect on tar yield with a maximum tar yield increment of 2.30 wt% at 30 wt% PVC, which is related to the negative synergistic effect on gas yield. Furthermore, the addition of PVC increases the content of 1–3 ring aromatics and decreases the content of aliphatics in the tar. The chlorine content in char and tar increases significantly with the increase of PVC addition. The addition of a CaO bed can significantly reduce the yield of HCl and the chlorine content in the tar. At 700 ℃, the dehydrochlorination efficiency of CaO can reach 78.1%. However, the CO2 produced by PS pyrolysis will reduce the dehydrochlorination efficiency of CaO, and this effect of CO2 can be reduced by increasing the temperature of the CaO bed.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste PVC and coal, with measurable product yields, chlorine migration analysis, and catalyst (CaO) performance data."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of herb residue and polypropylene for pyrolysis products upgrading and diversification using nickel-X/biochar and ZSM-5 (X = iron, cobalt, copper) It is very important to find cheap and efficient catalysts for catalytic co-pyrolysis. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of herb residue (HR) and reused polypropylene (PP) using Ni-X/biochar and ZSM-5 (X = Fe, Co, Cu) was performed to produce pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Bimetallic biochar catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity due to their higher specific surface area (SBET) and more strong acid sites. NiCu/biochar significantly increased the yield of pyrolysis oil by enhancing Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. In addition, the stronger secondary cracking capacity of NiCu/biochar resulted in the highest content of hydrocarbons (80.47%) and C6-C11(61.10%), while the availability of higher content of carbon source gas also facilitated the formation of CNTs and H2 at back-end. The cheap and efficient NiCu/biochar catalyst has great potential in the application of catalytic pyrolysis, which is conducive to the large-scale promotion of biomass pyrolysis technology.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and herb residue using fixed-bed reactors with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Direct production of olefins from the auger reactor-assisted steam pyrolysis of waste polyethylene Waste polyethylene was pyrolyzed using a process that combines auger reactor (AR) and fluidized bed reactor (FBR). This study primarily investigated the effects of the AR temperature, fluidized bed temperature, FBR freeboard temperature, and the type of fluidizing medium (steam vs. N2) on product distribution and light olefin yield. The most critical aspect of the process is the role of the AR. When the AR temperature is maintained at around 300 °C, the polymers inside the reactor melt. In this molten state, they are fed into the FBR, where pyrolysis takes place. Introducing polymers into the pyrolysis reactor in a molten, rather than solid state promotes their decomposition more effectively, resulting in enhanced production of light olefins. The experimental results confirmed this hypothesis. When the AR temperature was at 300–350 °C, the yield of C2–C4 olefins ranged from 50 to 52 wt%, which is up to approximately 8 wt% higher than the yield (44 wt%) obtained when the AR was unheated. The fluidized bed and freeboard temperatures were also found to influence gas production and the yield of C2–C4 olefins. In contrast, the choice of fluidizing medium had only a minimal effect on product distribution and light olefin yields. In conclusion, this study suggests that the AR-assisted steam pyrolysis process could serve as a straightforward method for the large-scale production of light olefins from plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polyethylene in a combined auger and fluidized bed reactor, with measurable yields of C2–C4 olefins and detailed analysis of temperature and fluidizing medium effects."
"Characterization, performance assessment, techno-economic potential, and process optimization of scrap tire pyrolysis in Bangladesh The objective of this study was to assess the effects of tire pyrolytic oil (TPO) blends on diesel engine performance, evaluate the techno-economic viability, and optimize the process variables using the response surface methodology (RSM) in order to increase the maximum product yield. To test engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics, the derived pyrolytic oil was employed in a four-stroke diesel engine with different diesel fuel blend ratios. It has been found that engine performance using a pyrolytic oil blend is much closer to the diesel fuel engine performance. This paper has briefly explored the economics of TPO production and the reliability improvements of the pyrolysis processes to make them viable for commercial applications. The techno-economic feasibility analysis has been conducted on a 10 tons'/day capacity pyrolytic plant. It has been found that the total cost and net revenue generation from one ton of scrap tires are $225.25 and $410.2, respectively. Additionally, the 8-year project's payback period is only 2.96 years, while the internal rate of return (IRR) was found to be 27.81%. The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was estimated at 1,658.62 tons per year. The RSM was used to optimize the process parameters for maximizing product yield. At the ideal conditions of 464.11 °C operating temperature, 59.53 min of running time, and 1.63 cm particle size, the projected maximum pyrolytic oil yield of 87.31 wt% and char yield of 7.63 wt % was reached. The reliability and applicability of the process were ensured through the developed regression model for pyrolytic oil and char with a high F-value and low P-value. The predicted results were validated, and it was found that the experimental data varied only by 1.21% from the predicted values. Therefore, this study provides investors with scientific guidance for pyrolysis-based energy generation projects in Bangladesh that are financially viable.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of scrap tires (a waste plastic material) with measurable product yields, optimized process parameters, and experimental validation using a diesel engine and regression modeling."
"Thermolysis of polyethylene The thermal degradation (or thermolysis) of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) was studied at moderate temperatures, 425–450 °C, under an inert atmosphere. One potential application for the products of polyethylene thermolysis is in the production of synthetic lubricants. For such an application, the product should be close to 1 decene in chain length and molecular structure. The major reaction product obtained from thermolysis, at a reaction temperature of 450 °C, was a liquid at room temperature with a yield of 82.5% of the initial charge to the reactor. The balance of the reaction products was in two parts: a residue and a non-condensable gas fraction, with yields of 9.5 and 8.0%, respectively. The liquid and residue fractions were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and gas chromatography. The liquid fraction had an average chain length of 13.6 carbons and a maximum total unsaturation of 70.8 mol%. The rate of liquid production with time was investigated and compared with theoretical predictions.",The study involves lab-scale thermolysis of waste polyethylene (LLDPE) at defined temperatures with measurable product yields and detailed analytical characterization of the liquid product.
"Conversion of plastics/HVGO mixtures to fuels by two-step processing A blend containing 20 wt.% low density polyethylene (PE) and 5 wt.% polyvinylchloride (PVC) in heavy vacuum gas oil was pyrolyzed at 623 K (dechlorination step). This mixture was then thermally and catalytically cracked in the presence of hydrogen at 673–723 K in a batch reactor (hydrocracking step). The liquid products from hydrocracking contained no chlorine compounds although the chlorine amount in the dechlorinated mixture was 700 ppm. Experiments have shown that the dechlorination step and the temperature had great effect on the product distribution from the hydrocracking step. It was observed that the dechlorination step led to both degradation of PE and dechlorination of PVC and that PE could be completely cracked with/without a catalyst by hydrocracking even though at 673 K. The use of a catalyst decreased the gas yield and led to an increase in coke yield at 723 K. The effect of the catalyst on the boiling point range of liquid product obtained from hydrocracking depended on the reaction temperature. The chlorine compounds in dechlorinated mixture affected the catalytic activity of the catalyst especially at 723 K. 75% and 55% of the liquid products obtained at 723 K with and without a catalyst, respectively, were hydrocarbons having boiling points ranging from 323 to 473K.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis and hydrocracking of waste plastics (PE and PVC) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Multi-products oriented co-pyrolysis of papers, plastics, and textiles in MSW and the synergistic effects Plastics, papers, and textiles are the main dry waste components of municipal solid waste (MSW). Product-oriented pyrolysis of these wastes under proper blend ratio could be important not only for improving the quality of char, oil, or gas from MSW pyrolysis, but also for enhancing the recycle of plastics from MSW. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of papers (ivory board, coated duplex board with grey back, kraft paper and offset printing paper), plastics (polypropylene and polyethylene), and textiles (cotton and polyester) were studied using thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) analysis, gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to obtain the optimum blend ratios for the desired products (gas, oil, volatile and char). The synergistic effects amongst different components during pyrolysis were investigated. Results showed that the co-pyrolysis of papers, plastics, and textiles under equal blend ratio promoted the production of aromatics, alkenes, water, alcohol, and phenol in volatile, but inhibited the production of CO2, CO, alkanes, and carbonyls. The optimum mass blend ratios were found to be paper: plastic: textile = 25 wt%: 50 wt%: 25 wt% and 12 wt%: 50 wt%: 38 wt%, respectively for obtaining the highest energy share in volatile and gas. While for producing char with higher surface area, higher paper ratio and lower plastics ratio is preferred. When the plastics percentage in mixture was increased from 12.5 wt% to 25 wt%, the oxygenates percentage in pyrolysis oil was reduced from 82 area% to 19 area%, further increase in plastics percentage, or, alterations of papers and textiles percentages did not show significant influence on oil composition, indicating that plastics can be recycled, without lowering the calorific values of pyrolysis oil or MSW for incineration, when their blend ratio in MSW exceeds 25 wt%.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (polypropylene and polyethylene), papers, and textiles with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reactor condition optimization."
"Evolution of light olefins during the pyrolysis of polyethylene in a two-stage process The accumulation of waste plastics has been one of the most urgent and difficult environmental challenges. In this work, the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PyGC-MS), and a two-stage tube reactor. The pyrolysis behavior of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is compared, and there are almost no differences in the thermogravimetric curves obtained by TGA and the yield of gaseous products obtained in a two-stage process. The evolution of light olefins (C2–C4) during the pyrolysis of PE is investigated in a two-stage process with a constant condition in the first stage (500 °C) and various conditions in the second stage (700–1000 °C, 0.2–0.4 s). The temperature in the second stage has a more significant effect on the yield and selectivity of light olefins than the residence time, and the ethylene, propylene, and butene yields do not increase monotonously as the temperature rises. The highest yield of light olefins of 76.1 wt% is obtained at 800 °C with a selectivity of 91.7%. The maximum yields of ethylene, propylene, and butene are 45.1 wt%, 17.3 wt%, and 24.3 wt%, respectively. The scission mechanisms are proposed to provide insight into the process during which PE molecules transform into light olefins.","The study investigates the lab-scale pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) using a two-stage tube reactor, reports measurable product yields and selectivity of light olefins, and includes experimental characterization via TGA and PyGC-MS."
"Microwave assisted co-pyrolysis of biomasses with polypropylene and polystyrene for high quality bio-oil production In this study, co-pyrolysis of five lignocellulosic biomass residues, viz. groundnut shell (G), bagasse (B), rice husk (RH), Prosopis juliflora (PJF) and mixed wood sawdust (MWSD), with two synthetic plastics, polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), was conducted to improve the quality of bio-oil. Equal composition of biomass and plastic was pyrolyzed at 450 W microwave power using graphite susceptor, and the yields of bio-oil, char and gas fractions were determined. The bio-oil yields from PS-biomass blends varied in the range of 51–60 wt%, with maximum yield obtained from PS-MWSD, while that from PP-biomass blends were 25–41 wt% with maximum yield obtained from PP-RH. The higher heating value of co-pyrolysis bio-oil was high (38–42 MJ kg−1) as compared to bio-oil obtained from only biomass pyrolysis (20–30 MJ kg−1). Energy yield of co-pyrolysis bio-oil was significantly higher with PS mixtures (73–81%) than PP mixtures (32–62%). Importantly, the bio-oil, char and gas yields, and organic composition of bio-oil were non-additive with respect to that obtained from pyrolysis of the individual feedstocks. The presence of PS boosted the production of aromatic hydrocarbons (48–54 wt%), while PP promoted aliphatic hydrocarbons (19–33 wt%) in co-pyrolysis bio-oil. Specifically, high selectivity towards alkanes in bio-oil was obtained from PP-RH mixture. Co-pyrolysis bio-oil contained less moisture with lower acidity compared to pyrolysis bio-oil. RH-PS and RH-PP mixtures were shown to be the better biomass-plastic combinations from the viewpoint of recovering high energy in bio-oil. The microwave co-pyrolysis process efficiency was also high (63–68%) and promising.","The study involves microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP and PS) with biomass, reporting measurable product yields, fuel properties, and product composition analysis."
"WEEE recycling: Pyrolysis of fire retardant model polymers Pyrolysis treatments of model polymers were made with the aim of studying the recycling of wastes from electronic, electric equipment containing brominated flame retardants. Pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene and epoxy resins were made both in flow and closed systems. Products of pyrolysis were analysed with FT–IR spectroscopy and GC–MS and the evolution of bromine was followed with a bromine ion specific electrode. The effect of alkali on pyrolysis was also studied demonstrating, as far epoxy resin is concerned, to be effective on decreasing bromine content in oil and volatile products leading to the recovery of bromine from the residue by washing. The alkali treatment was shown to be less effective in styrenic polymers containing brominated flame retardants.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (flame-retarded high impact polystyrene and epoxy resins) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization (FT-IR, GC–MS), and bromine evolution tracking, satisfying all required criteria."
"Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards, and migration and distribution of bromine Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of waste printed circuit boards (WPCB) was performed to investigate the characteristics of pyrolysis product and Br fixation. Pyrolysis conversion increased with increasing temperature, reaching 93.3 % at 650 °C. However, increasing heating time did not exhibit remarkable influence on pyrolysis conversion. At 350 °C, phenols were main compounds in the oil accounting for 91.15 %. As the temperature increased to 650 °C, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (except phenols) increased to 20.55 % and 19.03 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the total content of CO2, CO, CH4 and H2 in the non-condensable gases increased significantly. Addition of ZSM-5 and kaolin promoted the recombination reaction of pyrolysis products, increased the relative percentage of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (except phenols) and C11-C20 compounds in the oil, and reduced non-condensable gases. The oxygen bomb-ion chromatography was used to evaluate the Br content of pyrolysis residues. Higher pyrolysis temperature enhanced transfer of Br to pyrolysis gas. K2CO3, Na2CO3 and NaOH reacted with hydrogen bromide to generate KBr and NaBr, which significantly improved the Br fixation efficiency of pyrolysis residues (i.e. from 29.11%–99.80%, 96.39 % and 86.69 %, respectively) and reduced Br content in pyrolysis gas.","The study involves microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards, a type of plastic-containing waste, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent product composition, catalyst performance, and fuel gas analysis."
"Pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics study of four typical trolley case materials in passenger trains Piled-up luggage is a non-negligible fire load in passenger trains. Four mainstream trolley case materials are selected in the study, and the main components are polypropylene (TC-PP), polycarbonate (TC-PC), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (TC-ABS), and PC/ABS blend (TC-PC/ABS). The pyrolysis behaviors under an air atmosphere with four heating rates are tested using a thermogravimetric analyzer, and the behavior under nitrogen with a heating rate is further tested for comparison. Two model-free methods are used to obtain the activation energy (E a), and the reaction mechanism of the target materials is characterized. Moreover, the pyrolysis products are analyzed coupled with an FTIR spectrometer. The thermogravimetric results show that the pyrolysis processes of the four materials in air and nitrogen atmospheres differed significantly. The E a of TC-PP, TC-PC, TC-ABS, and TC-PC/ABS obtained by the KAS method are in the range of 82.1–294.4, 93.7–394.2, 156.5–419.3, and 152.1–313.6 kJ·mol−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the values obtained by the Friedman method are in the range of 80.7–722.1, 63.6–448.9, 195.3–821.2, and 131.9–371.9 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The SB model is introduced to better characterize the reaction mechanism rather than a single existing theoretical model. The FTIR results demonstrate that the main pyrolysis product of the four materials under air is CO2.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of commercial plastic materials (PP, PC, ABS, and PC/ABS blend) with measurable product analysis, temperature–yield relationships, and experimental characterization using TGA and FTIR."
"Valorization of waste PET: Understanding the role of active ammonia in facilitating PET depolymerization and aromatic nitrile formation Realizing the recovery and valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics into value-added products have gained significant importance. This study successfully synthesized aromatic nitriles, specifically terephthalonitrile (TPN), from waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic through in situ catalytic pyrolysis with urea and γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Based on distributed activation energy model, positive interaction between waste PET and urea is responsible for improved thermal decomposition kinetics. The dosage of urea and pyrolysis temperature significantly influenced TPN production. TPN yield reached 32.5% with ca. selectivity of 85% at 550 °C and equivalent urea dosage. Density functional theory calculations validated the role of active ammonia in reducing energy barriers and thus facilitating PET depolymerization. The study highlights the feasibility of recycling waste PET into valuable aromatic nitriles through in situ catalytic pyrolysis with urea and enhances the understanding of the pyrolysis process.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste PET plastic with measurable yields and product composition analysis, including TPN yield and selectivity at specific temperatures."
"Comprehensive kinetic study of thermal degradation of polyvinylchloride (PVC) The plastic waste accumulation has been increasing and a solution other than landfilling is required. Due to the high cost of recycling, thermal treatment could be an option. However, the existence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) would release hydrochloric acid which would cause emission problems as well as damage to the reactor systems. The thermal degradation of PVC has been studied over the years. However, the mechanism of the PVC thermal degradation is not fully developed. Specifically, the mechanism of the PVC thermal degradation at medium temperatures, which is more practical for industries, is still lacking. A degradation temperature of 300 °C was used to study the dehydrochlorination behavior of PVC. A rather comprehensive mechanism with four consecutive reactions has been developed based on the micro-pyrolysis experiments and has been validated and proved by predicting the mass loss, chlorine content, heat content and elemental composition with high precision experimental data in different reactors with/without heat transfer coupling.","The study involves laboratory-scale micro-pyrolysis experiments on waste PVC plastic, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and experimental validation of degradation mechanisms using real data."
"Depolymerization of HDPE to wax in the presence of a catalyst formed by homonuclear macrocyclic zirconium complex chemically bonded to alumina support A homonuclear macrocyclic Zr–Zr complex was prepared starting with 2,6-diformyl-phenol and 1,2-phenylene diamine and is chemically bonded with carbamate-modified alumina. The TPD of the catalyst having adsorbed NH3 shows the presence of acid sites on the surface of the catalyst and the catalyst is stable under the reaction temperature studied. The catalytic depolymerization of commercially available high-density polyethylene (molecular weight 4.79×105) was carried out in the presence of nitrogen as well as oxygen at about pressure of 300 of kg/cm2 and temperature of 370°C. Catalytic depolymerization in the presence N2 occurs with the time delay of 2h (as opposed to 4h for thermal depolymerization occurring above 400°C) and stops with the formation of wax (as opposed to C5–C16 liquidous alkanes in thermal depolymerization). The wax thus formed was characterized and shown to be the Arge wax (available commercially) having a melting point of 80°C and molecular weight of 392. We have proposed a kinetic model in which the catalyst forms a complex with polyethylene radical formed at high temperature, which gives depolymerization to form wax molecules.","The study involves catalytic depolymerization of commercial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under controlled temperature and pressure, with measurable product yields (wax) and characterization, satisfying all criteria for plastic pyrolysis research."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic from electrical and electronic equipment Plastic waste collected from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) was pyrolysed in the presence of zeolite catalysts to produce a gasoline range aromatic oil. The plastic was from equipment containing cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and also plastic waste from refrigeration equipment. In addition, for comparison the main plastics contained in the WEEE, in the form of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) were also pyrolysed in the presence of the zeolite catalysts. Two zeolite catalysts; Y zeolite and ZSM-5 were used. Catalytic pyrolysis took place in a two stage fixed bed, batch reactor with the plastic pyrolysed in the first stage and the evolved pyrolysis gases catalysed in the second stage reactor. The quantity of oil produced from uncatalysed pyrolysis of plastics from CRTs and refrigerators was more than 80wt%. The gases consisted of hydrogen, methane and C2–C4 hydrocarbons. When the zeolite catalysts were introduced there was a decrease of between 5 and 10wt% in oil yield and a corresponding increase in gas yield. The composition of the oils derived from the uncatalysed pyrolysis of WEEE plastics were mainly aromatic with high concentrations of styrene, derived from the HIPS and ABS present in the plastic waste. Addition of the zeolite ZSM-5 and Y zeolite to the pyrolysis process resulted in significant concentrations of benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene in the product oil but reduced concentrations of styrene. The oils from both thermal and catalysed pyrolysis also contained significant concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for example, naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics from electronic equipment, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Study of the effects of regeneration of USY zeolite on the catalytic cracking of polyethylene In this work, a study of the deactivation and reuse of USY zeolite for the pyrolysis of polyethylene has been carried out in a batch reactor at 500 °C. From the different tested zeolite/plastic ratios, 1/10 is the optimal ratio which allows giving rise to a liquid product free of wax. Regeneration was established by heating at 500 °C for 3 h coked zeolite in presence of air. The liquid yield begins to increase from the 11th cycle of regeneration until reaching a maximum at the 14th cycle showing a lost in the zeolite activity producing a viscous product. The liquid fraction derived from the first eight cycles was a mixture of C4-C27 compounds with a maximum C5-C7 fraction. In the 14th cycle of regeneration, compounds having higher carbon number were obtained and the yield of linear compounds increases up to 29%. To explain the relative activity of the regenerated zeolite, the textural properties and the XRD patterns results of the zeolite recovered after the 1st and 14th cycles have been compared with those obtained with fresh catalyst. The study showed that after 14 cycles of regeneration, the zeolite is still active but its activity level has decreased.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature conditions, catalyst regeneration cycles, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Insights into pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of biomass and polystyrene: Thermochemical behaviors, kinetics and evolved gas analysis The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect on polystyrene (PS) during co-pyrolysis with biomass through thermal decomposition. The model-free iso-conversional methods (Kissinger, Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, Starink and Vyazovkin) were adopted to calculate activation energy of the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis process of two biomass samples (walnut shell: WS and peach stones: PST) with PS. It is found that biomass blending to PS decreased activation energy values and resulted in multi-step reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, changes in the evolution profiles of methyl, water, methoxy, carbon dioxide, benzene and styrene was monitored through evolved gas analysis via TGA/FT-IR and TGA/MS. Detection of temperature dependent release of volatiles indicated the differences occur as a result of compositional differences of biomass.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene and biomass mixtures with measured product evolution, activation energy, and analytical characterization using TGA/FT-IR and TGA/MS."
"Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of a mixture of plastics from small waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) Pyrolysis seems a promising route for recycling of heterogeneous, contaminated and additives containing plastics from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). This study deals with the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of a synthetic mixture containing real waste plastics, representative of polymers contained in small WEEE. Two zeolite-based catalysts were used at 400°C: HUSY and HZSM-5 with a high silica content, while three different temperatures were adopted for the thermal cracking: 400, 600 and 800°C. The mass balance showed that the oil produced by pyrolysis is always the main product regardless the process conditions selected, with yields ranging from 83% to 93%. A higher yield was obtained when pyrolysis was carried out with HZSM-5 at 400°C and without catalysts, but at 600 and 800°C. Formation of a significant amount of solid residue (about 13%) is observed using HUSY. The oily liquid product of pyrolysis, analysed by GC–MS and GC-FID, as well as by elemental analysis and for energy content, appeared lighter, less viscous and with a higher concentration of monoaromatics under catalytic condition, if compared to the liquid product derived from thermal degradation at the same temperature. HZSM-5 led to the production of a high yield of styrene (17.5%), while HUSY favoured the formation of ethylbenzene (15%). Energy released by combustion of the oil was around 39MJ/kg, thus suggesting the possibility to exploit it as a fuel, if the recovery of chemical compounds could not be realised. Elemental and proximate analysis of char and GC-TCD analysis of the gas were also performed. Finally, it was estimated to what extent these two products, showing a relevant ability to release energy, could fulfil the energy demand requested in pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics from WEEE, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of oil, gas, and char."
"The role of temperature program and catalytic system on the quality of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene degradation oil Thermal and catalytic degradation of acrylonitrile-butadien-styrene copolymer (ABS) was performed at 450°C by semi-batch operation. Four different temperature programs were used for thermal degradation. SA4 silica alumina and three SA4/iron oxide combinations (γ-Fe2O3, a Fe3O4-C composite and α-FeOOH) were used for catalytic degradation. The heating rate affects the quality of the degradation oil, the following heating program giving the lowest amount of heavy nitrogen-containing compounds: room temperature→400°C (heating rate β=10°C min−1)→450°C (β=1°C min−1; then isothermally hold at 450°C for 210 min). SA4 catalyst used in liquid phase contact mode has a cracking effect on ABS degradation. The SA4/iron oxide catalytic systems give better results than the separate use of the catalysts, converting the heavy nitrogen (N)-containing compounds into light aliphatic nitriles that can be easily removed from the degradation oil by distillation. With SA4/α-FeOOH system the amount of 4-phenylbutyronitrile, the main N-containing compound from ABS thermal degradation, was strongly decreased in oil, from 17.5 to 1.7 wt.%.","The study involves lab-scale thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste ABS plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalytic performance analysis."
"Valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate plastic into N-doped microporous carbon for CO2 capture through a one-pot synthesis Valorization of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into microporous carbon with N-doping treatment was successfully performed in a one-pot synthesis and the N-doped microporous carbon was used for CO2 capture, which can mitigate plastic pollution and climate change simultaneously. The PET-derived microporous carbon developed by KOH activation and urea treatment in a one-pot synthesis at 700 °C exhibited the highest CO2 adsorption uptake of 6.23 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 4.58 mmol g−1 at 25 °C (1 atm). The Langmuir and pseudo second-order models displayed well-fitting relationships with equilibrium and kinetic experimental data obtained in this study. The N-doped microporous carbon showed high CO2 selectivity over N2, implying that it is feasible for treating flue gases (10% CO2 and 90% N2) at 50 °C. In addition, the CO2 uptake was not only affected by micropores but also related with nitrogen and oxygen functional groups. Compared to the porous carbon prepared by two-pot synthesis where KOH activation and urea treatment were conducted separately, the porous carbon prepared by one-pot synthesis had higher oxygen contents and higher CO2 adsorption uptake. All of findings implied that the N-doped microporous carbon was successfully developed from waste PET plastic for capturing CO2 and can play a promising role in both sustainable waste management and environmental protection.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste PET plastic through a one-pot synthesis at 700 °C, producing N-doped microporous carbon with measurable CO2 adsorption uptake and characterized product yields and performance."
"Thermal decomposition of polypropylene plastics through vacuum pyrolysis The technique of thermal pyrolysis has a great contribution to waste-to-energy platform and circular economic mission. This study used an internal heating process for the vacuum pyrolysis of plastic waste. Eight heating tubes were placed inside a reactor to accelerate heat transfer to the feedstock. Uniform temperature distribution was achieved in C22 at 9%. Gas chromatography–thermal conductivity detector analysis of noncondensable gases revealed that the main product of PP with 75% area was C2H6. Furthermore, the Taguchi method was used to optimize the vacuum pyrolysis of waste to energy. Optimal operating conditions for maximum pyrolytic yields were as follows: temperature 425 °C, heating rate 15 °C/min, residence time 6 h, and output flow rate 0.1 L/min. Moreover, the physical properties, cetane number, soot propensities, and auto-ignition temperature of pyrolytic oil were comparable to petroleum diesel. The heating value of the oil product was 55.96 MJ/kg, which was higher compared with petroleum fuels. Vacuum pyrolysis mass, carbon, and energy balances were also determined. This study demonstrated the novel use of internal heating in vacuum pyrolysis. Ultimately, this study provided a new technique of internal heating method in vacuum pyrolysis.","The study involves vacuum pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic waste with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and defined reactor conditions."
"Chemical recycling of PC/ABS-blends by pyrolysis Not all plastics can be recycled mechanically. Polycarbonate (PC) combined with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is one such material used in applications like electronic casings and automotive components. Since mechanical recycling of PC/ABS results in thermal degradation and the loss of required properties, alternative methods are sought. Pyrolysis, the thermal decomposition without oxygen, preferentially cleaves certain bonds, yielding valuable monomers. This study investigates the pyrolysis of non-flame-retarded and flame-retarded PC/ABS blends at laboratory and pilot plant scales. Analyses utilized thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR). The blends exhibited two decomposition stages influenced by flame retardants. The IR spectra provided insights into the structural properties of volatile compounds. CO2 yield ranged from 6 % to 8 %, with the flame-retarded blend showing 0.5–1 % higher yields. Subsequently, we conducted experiments in a fixed-bed reactor, varying the pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and blend composition. Masses of gaseous, liquid, and solid products were measured, with a liquid yield optimum at 480–500∘C. All product fractions were analyzed. Liquid products contained valuable compounds like phenol, styrene, and bisphenol-A, analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC×GC-MS). For the non-flame-retardant blend, bisphenol-A was the main product (25–30 %), while phenol dominated (10–15 %) in the flame-retardant blend.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste PC/ABS blends with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent optimization, and detailed analytical characterization of liquid products using GC and GC×GC-MS."
"Study of the polymer–catalyst contact effectivity and the heating rate influence on the HDPE pyrolysis This paper studies the effect of two different parameters on the different fractions obtained in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE using HZSM-5. On one hand, the influence of the heating rate on the results obtained has been studied by selecting two totally different heating rates: flash and slow (5°C/min) pyrolysis. On the other hand, two different types of samples have been pyrolyzed at each heating rate: dry catalyst–polymer blend and melted blend (prepared in an extruder). The results obtained allow us to evaluate the influence of the contact effectivity between polymer and catalyst, as well as the effect of the type of heating on the product distribution. In general, catalytic pyrolysis leads to higher volatiles yields than thermal degradation and the pyrolysis of a melted blend reaches always higher yields than a dry blend. It seems than a better contact between polymer and catalyst implies a more noticeable activity of the catalyst although both parameters, heating rate and polymer–catalyst contact, are interconnected and the grade of influence of the type of blend used depends, in many cases, on the heating rate of the process. A detailed quantitative analysis of the compounds generated under these different conditions has been performed.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE with measurable product yields, heating rate effects, catalyst-polymer contact comparisons, and detailed product composition analysis."
"A global kinetic model as a tool to reproduce the deactivation behaviour of the HZSM-5 zeolite in the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene The deactivation behaviour of the HZSM-5 zeolite in the catalytic cracking of LDPE has been analysed. Four important properties of the partly deactivated catalysts have been measured: firstly, the activity of the fresh and partly coked zeolites in the pyrolysis reactions in TG; secondly, the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts after each reaction; thirdly the effect of the coke content of the catalyst on their acid properties and in the fourth place the effect of the coke content on their surface properties. The experimental study of the deactivation behaviour of HZSM-5 during the catalytic cracking of LDPE has permitted a new and simple kinetic model to be developed that takes into account the effect of the coke formation on the catalytic activity decay and the acid and surface properties of the zeolite. The model considered in the present work has been applied to simultaneously correlate the TG data of the successive reaction cycles, the NH3 TPD experimental curves and the nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of the amount of coke in the catalyst. Very good correlation results have been obtained, proving that the method suggested allows a quantitative and simultaneous correlation of the global deactivation behaviour of the HZSM-5 in the catalytic cracking of LDPE.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measured product yields, catalyst deactivation, coke deposition, and characterization of acid and surface properties using TG, NH3 TPD, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms."
"Catalytic fast pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate plastic for the selective production of terephthalonitrile under ammonia atmosphere Terephthalonitrile (TPN) was directly produced from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic via catalytic fast pyrolysis with ammonia. The optimal condition for producing TPN was over 1 g γ-Al2O3-2 wt% catalyst at 500 °C under carrier gas (50% NH3 and 50% N2) with yield of nitriles and TPN of 58.1 and 52.3 C%, respectively. The selectivity of TPN in the nitriles was around 90%. Meanwhile, a bit of aromatics, benzonitrile, acetonitrile were also produced as by-products with the total yields of less than 3 C%. The catalyst deactivated slightly after 5 cycles. Possible reaction routes were proposed and it was found that terephthalic acid, benzoic acid, related esters and amides were the major intermediates from PET to nitriles. Acetonitrile could be produced from acetaldehyde and its corresponding imines. In addition, 32.1 C% TPN with high purity (>95%) was obtained via freezing recrystallization. Catalytic pyrolysis with ammonia process was a promising technology for converting waste PET plastics to TPN. This study provided a new method for producing N-containing chemicals from polyester plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste PET plastic with measurable yields, product composition, and catalyst performance under defined conditions."
"Thermochemical conversion of polyethylene in a fluidized bed: Impact of transition metal-induced oxygen transport on product distribution Thermochemical conversion in dual fluidized bed (DFB) systems is a potential alternative to the recycling of abundantly available plastic waste. The development of oxygen transport in DFB systems is in most cases unavoidable due to the transition metal content of the bed material as well as the metal fraction in the waste stream. This work investigates the influence of transition metal oxide-induced oxygen transport on the thermochemical conversion of high-density polyethylene, a model plastic feedstock, in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Conversion in the reactor at 700 °C was investigated using four different bed materials that had different concentrations of iron oxide. The share of carbon oxides among the gaseous products increased with an increase in the iron oxide content of the bed material. The yield of light olefinic and paraffinic compounds decreased with increased iron oxide content of the bed. The presence of iron oxide in the bed material significantly increased the formation rates of aromatic compounds and solid carbon deposits on the bed material. The observed shift in the product distribution due to oxygen transport follows a dehydrogenation-type reaction mechanism.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields and analytical characterization of reaction products.
"Preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon-rich bio-oils by catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and plastics based on HZSM-5, MCM-41, and HZSM-5/MCM-41 The catalytic co-pyrolysis processes of biomass components (microcrystalline cellulose (MC), xylan (XY), and alkali lignin (AL)) and plastics (polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS)) were studied using HZSM-5, MCM-41, and HZSM-5/MCM-41. For non-catalytic pyrolysis, the co-pyrolysis of MC and AL with plastics are beneficial for increasing the yield of hydrocarbons. The presence of MC, XY, and AL does not exert significant influences on the distribution of types of pyrolysis products of PP, and the interaction of the three components with PS is conducive to the generation of styrene. The introduction of catalysts can increase the yield of hydrocarbons in the co-pyrolysis products of biomass components and plastics. The combination of MC (52.39 %)/XY (35.77 %), PP, and HZSM-5 is most beneficial for increasing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly due to the synergistic effect between MC/XY-derived oxygenates and PP-derived hydrocarbons through the hydrocarbon pool mechanism, the hydrogen transfer reaction, and the Diels-Alder reaction. For the catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass components and PS, HZSM-5 shows significantly superior selectivity for mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, while HZSM-5/MCM-41 and MCM-41 obviously promote the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The research provides a reference for the preparation of high-quality bio-oils through oriented co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PS) with biomass components using defined catalysts and reports measurable product yields and compositional analysis."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of waste packaging polyethylene using AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt as catalyst Catalytic pyrolysis is an attractive and promising way to recycle waste plastics. In this paper, AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt was used as the catalyst to pyrolyze waste polyethylene (WPE), and its catalytic activity was studied. Thermogravimetry (TG), gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were applied to investigate the pyrolysis behavior of WPE in the presence of AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt during the catalytic pyrolysis. Subsequently, the char separated from the pyrolysis residue were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), nitrogen adsorption and desorption testing, respectively. The results show that our strategy allows for the pyrolysis of WPE in the presence of molten AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt, which can not only reduce the initial pyrolysis temperature (below 200 °C) significantly but also play a key role in increasing the reaction rate. Accordingly, it is a safe and environmentally benign treatment of “white pollutions” by both reducing energy consumption of pyrolysis process and alleviating the environmental pollutions. Besides, another advantage of using the AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt as catalyst in pyrolysis of WPE is that the components of the heavy oil in the liquid products was much more reduced and no olefin was generated thus narrowing the composition distribution and improving their utilization value for further use. What’s more, the char separated from residue contains many pore structures with a BET surface area of 218-277 m2 g−1. As results, this strategy provides a new avenue for the applications of eutectic salt for catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (a commercial plastic) using AlCl3-NaCl eutectic salt, with measurable experimental data including reduced pyrolysis temperature, product yields, GC–MS analysis, and BET surface area of char."
"Silicon photovoltaic modules at end-of-life: Removal of polymeric layers and separation of materials An eco-friendly process to recover valuable materials deriving from silicon based photovoltaic panels at end-of-life has been proposed. In particular, in this paper a new two-step process to separate and recover glass, Si and metals has been investigated and discussed. A preliminary mechanical treatment to remove fluorinated polymers allows to exclude dangerous emissions of hydrofluoric acid and fluorinated compounds coming out from conventional heat treatments. A subsequent thermal treatment allows the complete removal of the residual polymers and the separation of valuable materials. The influence of treatment time, temperature and atmosphere, during the polymers degradation has been evaluated and the by-products have been examined. The process efficiency has been assessed by determining the quantity and quality of the recovered materials. The results have shown that the combination of the two mechanical/thermal processes allows energy efficiency and environmental sustainability with respect to conventional recovery treatments. The optimal operating conditions for the thermal treatment have turned out 500 °C for 1 h in oxidizing atmosphere. The quality of the recovered materials has been determined by analysing the residual carbon content after the thermal treatment. The gaseous products of the polymeric degradation have been characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis.","The study involves thermal treatment of polymeric layers from end-of-life photovoltaic modules, with GC–MS analysis of gaseous products, temperature–yield relationships, and measurable product characterization, satisfying all criteria for plastic pyrolysis at lab scale with extractable data."
"Hydrogen production from polystyrene pyrolysis and gasification: Characteristics and kinetics Polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis and gasification have been examined in a semi-batch reactor at temperatures of 700, 800 and 900°C. Characteristic differences between pyrolysis and gasification of polystyrene (PS) have been evaluated with specific performance focus on the evolution of syngas flow rate, evolution of hydrogen flow rate, evolution of output power, syngas yield, hydrogen yield, energy yield, apparent thermal efficiency and syngas quality. Behavior of PS under either pyrolysis or gasification processes is compared to that of char based sample, such as paper and cardboard. In contrast to char based materials, PS gasification yielded less syngas, hydrogen and energy than pyrolysis at 700°C. However, the gasification of PS yielded more syngas, hydrogen and energy than pyrolysis at 900°C temperature. Gasification of PS is affected by reactor temperature more than PS pyrolysis. Syngas, hydrogen and energy yield increased exponentially with temperature in case of gasification. However, syngas and energy yield increased linearly with temperature having rather a mild slope in the case of pyrolysis. Pyrolysis resulted in higher syngas quality at all temperatures. Kinetics of hydrogen evolution from the PS pyrolysis is introduced. The Coats and Redfern method was used to determine the kinetic parameters, activation energy (E act), pre-exponential factor (A) and reaction order (n). The model used is the nth order chemical reaction model. Kinetic parameters have been determined for three slow heating rates, namely 8, 10 and 12°C/min. The average values obtained from the three heating rate experiments were used to compare the model with the experimental data.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis and gasification of polystyrene (a commercial plastic) in a semi-batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and kinetic analysis of hydrogen evolution."
"Fabrication of CeO2-supported catalysts for regulating CNTs synthesis from plastic wastes The recycling of plastic wastes is key to not only the development of circular economy, but also the safety of living environment. Herein, CeO2 support was prepared and used to fabricate Fe/CeO2 catalyst, which facilitated CNTs synthesis from polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and real plastic wastes (RPW). The catalysts and carbon products were analyzed by XRD, TEM, SEM-EDS, XPS, N2 physisorption, H2-TG, H2-TPR, TG-DSC and Raman. It was found that Fe/CeO2 catalyst effectively regulated CNTs growth under various operating conditions, obtaining (1) the uniform, regular, long and straight CNTs, (2) the high CNTs yield of 1090.0 mg/g or (3) the excellent crystallinity and graphitization degree of CNTs. Furthermore, Fe-based catalysts with commercial supports (CeO2(nm), Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2) were fabricated and used for CNTs synthesis from PE, which were taken as the reference to reveal the unique role of Fe/CeO2 catalyst in regulating CNTs synthesis. Compared with CeO2(nm), Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 supports, CeO2 support exhibited a smaller crystallite and particle size, enhanced the reducibility and improved the metal-support interaction, which was positive to the growth of long-straight CNTs. The unique role of Fe/CeO2 catalyst in regulating CNTs synthesis was inherent for different carbon sources including plastic wastes and hydrocarbons. This work may provide a new research direction for catalyst design and preparation towards fine-tuning the synthesis of CNTs from plastic wastes.","The study involves pyrolysis of plastic wastes (PE, PP, PS, and real plastic wastes) to synthesize CNTs, with experimental data on catalyst performance, product characterization, and measurable yields."
"Conversion of hazardous plastic wastes into useful chemical products Azoisobutylnitrile (AIBN) initiator was used in the treatment of most widely used domestic plastics in lieu of catalysts. The pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), poly-ethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) plastics with azoisobutylnitrile was carried out individually under nitrogen atmosphere. A series of single (plastic/AIBN) and binary (mixed plastics/AIBN) reactions were carried out in a 25-cm3 micro-autoclave reactor. The optimum conditions selected for this study were: 5% AIBN by weight of total plastics, 60min, 650psi and 420°C. It was found that HDPE, LDPE, PP underwent to a maximum cracking and produced highest amounts of liquid and gaseous products. Pyrolysis of PET and PS plastics with AIBN afforded comparatively significant amount of insoluble organic materials. In other reactions, fixed ratios of mixed plastics were pyrolyzed with AIBN that afforded excellent yields of liquid hydrocarbons. This result shows a very significant increase in the liquid portions of the products on using AIBN in the pyrolysis of plastics. The use of AIBN in the pyrolysis of plastics is seems to be feasible and an environmental friendly alternative to catalytic process for maximizing the liquid fuels or chemical feed stocks in higher amounts.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP, PET, PS) with measurable yields and conditions, using a micro-autoclave reactor and AIBN as a decomposer, with product analysis and yield optimization reported."
"Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and waste high-density polyethylene: Synergistic effect and product distributions Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) with waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was performed in a fixed-bed reactor under different temperatures (400–700 °C) and blending ratios (0–100%). Product yields and chemical compositions were compared with those from the pyrolysis of individual components to ascertain the synergistic effect between SCB and HDPE. The synergistic effect of SCB and HDPE produced higher liquid yield than the theoretical value. The effect was strongest at 600 °C and 60:40 HDPE:SCB ratio, with the maximum difference of 6.02 wt%. The positive synergistic effects on the production of high-value organic compounds (alcohol, hydrocarbons, and aromatics) and inhibition of oxygenated compounds were most prominent at 600 °C and 40:60 HDPE:SCB ratio. SCB-derived hydroxyl radicals favored the secondary cracking of HDPE primary volatiles, thereby promoting the formation of aliphatic compounds with lower carbon numbers. Co-pyrolysis of SCB and HDPE also produced oil with higher carbon (34% higher) and hydrogen (47% higher) contents, and with lower oxygen content (70% lower) than those of SCB pyrolysis oil. It also achieved a high calorific value of 42.41 MJ/kg, which is comparable to those of commercial diesel fuels.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste HDPE (a commercial plastic) with sugarcane bagasse, reporting measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis of common plastics and their mixtures to produce valuable petroleum-like products In the present study, polystyrene (PS), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and their mixture undergo intermediate isothermal pyrolysis at 450 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 600 °C inside a tubular semi-continuous reactor under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The liquid pyrolytic oil samples recovered in each case were analyzed through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to identify and quantify the different products formed. It was found that polyethylenes (HDPE and LDPE) behave similarly in these pyrolysis conditions. For instance, GC analysis showed consecutive triplet series of linear aliphatic hydrocarbons at each carbon number of the alkane, 1-alkene, 1,(N-1)-alkadiene where N is the carbon number. On the other hand, PP, LDPE, and HDPE pyrolytic oil were rich in olefinic compounds. However, the case was quite different for PS. The pyrolytic oil was constituted totally of aromatic compounds ranging from mono to tri aromatic hydrocarbons. Styrene was the main product, along with other products such as styrene dimer, styrene trimer, benzene, toluene, bibenzyl, and α-methylstyrene. Results showed an increase in lighter hydrocarbons as the temperature increased, especially for styrene, where the weight fraction in the oil increased from 40 wt.% to 60 wt.%. Ultimately, a synergistic effect was observed with mixed plastic pyrolysis, yielding lighter compounds with a lower liquid quantity. In addition, the quality of the oil seems to be improved by the increase of around 10 wt.% of both aromatic and light compounds from the expected value at the expense of the heavier fraction. The computed lower heating value (LHV) for gaseous and liquid products ranged between 40 MJ/kg and 51 MJ/kg. A quick glance at the possible end use of each oil was investigated along with a principal component analysis (PCA) on the pyrolytic oil.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PS, LDPE, HDPE, PP) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization using GC–MS and GC-FID."
"Activator-assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene One of the most promising ways to recycle plastic is pyrolysis. Valuable fuels and chemicals can be obtained by pyrolysis of waste plastic. In this study, pyrolysis of polypropylene was conducted using a novel continuous two-stage process equipped with auger and fluidized bed reactors connected in series. The auger reactor played an important role as an activator to elevate the vibrational states of molecules fed into the fluidized bed reactor. Hence, the two-stage pyrolysis conducted herein was called activator-assisted pyrolysis. In this study, the effects of the temperatures of the auger reactor (or activator) and bubbling and freeboard zones of the fluidized bed reactor, the type of the fluidizing medium (product gas and N2), and the residence time of pyrolysis vapor on the product distribution and composition were investigated. In the experiments, the activator facilitated decomposition of polypropylene molecules, resulting in a high yield of the product gases (81 wt%) consisting mainly of H2 and CH4. The maximum olefin (ethene, propene, 1,3-butadiene, and butenes) yield was 52 wt%. The pyrolysis oil mainly consisted of aromatics (up to 92 wt%), particularly mono-aromatics. The activation energies of the activated and unactivated molecules were calculated using the Friedman and Flynn–Ozawa–Wall methods. The activation energy of the activated molecules was approximately 17 kJ/mol lower than that of unactivated molecules. Hence, it was clear that the degradation mechanism of polypropylene was different when activator-assisted pyrolysis was applied. The new activator-assisted pyrolysis proposed in the current work could be helpful to produce valuable chemicals from the pyrolysis of polyolefin waste.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene using a continuous two-stage reactor system with measurable product yields, temperature effects, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of Chinese herb residue and polypropylene over Ni, Fe, Co and Cu/AC: Co-production and formation mechanism of carbon nanomaterials, liquid oil and pyrolysis gas The preparation of high-value fuels and carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) by co-pyrolysis of Chinese herb residue (CHR) and polypropylene (PP) is conducive to the improvement of environment and energy problems. The effect of monometallic (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu) and bimetallic (Ni/Fe, Ni/Co, Ni/Cu) loaded on activated carbon (AC) catalysts on the pyrolysis products was investigated in a two-stage fixed bed. The results showed that the synergistic effect of bimetals improved the quality of pyrolysis products. In particular, NiCo/AC significantly promoted the removal of F and improved the quality of liquid oil. Moreover, the content of over C20 in the Ni/Co group was the lowest, indicating that the secondary cracking of macromolecules was promoted. NiCo/AC also improved the yield and quality of pyrolysis gas. The content of H2 in Ni/Co group increased to 27.82%. In addition, Ni/Co group had the highest yield (more than 4 times that of blank group) and quality (ID/IG = 1.019) of CNMs. The pyrolysis gas obtained from different front-end catalytic has a great influence on the formation of back-end CNMs. The high CH4 promoted the formation of CNMs. A unique 3D graphitic carbon (GC) network was finally formed in high temperature.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with Chinese herb residue, reporting measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Recovery material from a new designed surgical face mask: A complementary approach based on mechanical and thermo-chemical recycling The usage of disposable face mask to control the spread of COVID-19 disease has led to the alarming generation of a huge amount of plastic waste in a short span of time. On other hand, face masks are made of high-quality thermoplastic polymers that could be recovered and converted into valuable products. The aim of this study is to investigate a complementary approach for the recycling of face mask in lab-scale plants: the mechanical recycling of the filter in polypropylene (PP) and the chemical recycling of the whole face mask. For this purpose, a new designed surgical face mask was chemically and physically characterized. The results shows that the face mask was composed of 92.3 wt% high grade PP (filter), very similar to virgin PP but with a high melt volume index (MVI, 385 cm3/10 min) due to its non-woven manufacturing. The PP from face mask was mixed with recycled virgin PP in order to obtain a MVI suitable for the extrusion process and recycled as filament for 3D printing. This filament was used to print a specimen with a very similar visual quality of that printed with a commercial PP filament. Simultaneously, the whole face mask underwent a pyrolysis process to produce new feedstocks or fuels. Low-cost catalysts derived from coal fly ash (CFA) were employed to enhance the production of light hydrocarbons. In particular, the synthetized acid X zeolite (HX/CFA) improved the yield of light fractions up to 91 wt% (79 wt% for thermal pyrolysis) and the quality of the light oil with the 85% of C6–C10 (55% for thermal pyrolysis). Furthermore, HX/CFA decreased the degradation temperature of PP to 384 °C versus 458 °C of thermal cracking.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of whole surgical face masks composed of high-grade polypropylene, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition, and reactor conditions reported."
"Studies on co-pyrolysis of microalgae and polymeric waste (plastic/rubber): Thermal behavior, kinetics, and product characteristics Frequent global health crises pose the challenge of effectively recycling the vast amounts of waste polymers generated by pandemics. The co-pyrolysis of polymers and microalgae to produce high value-added chemicals and fuels presents a promising solution for waste management. The present work aims to comprehensively study the thermal degradation properties, synergistic effects, kinetic parameters, product distribution, and pyrolytic oil composition of Chlorella vulgaris (CV), polystyrene (PS), and nitrile butadiene gloves (NBG) co-pyrolysis. The results show that the interaction during co-pyrolysis promotes CV decomposition. The kinetic analysis indicated that CV:PS:NBG reduced the activation energy at all phases. The master plot method shows that CV, PS, and NBG correspond to the order reaction model (F8), nucleation model (A2), and diffusional model (D3), respectively. Meanwhile, the 1D diffusion model (D1), second-order model (F2), and first-order model (F1) are more suitable for the pyrolysis processes of CV:PS, CV:NBG and CV:PS:NBG. The thermodynamic characteristics suggest that all components require external energy to form activated complexes, and the presence of polymers promotes this process. Co-pyrolysis greatly enhanced the pyrolysis oil yield, from 45.58 wt% for the CV alone pyrolysis to 67.36 wt% for CV:PS, 50.59 wt% for CV:NBG, and 61.43 wt% for CV:PS:NBG. Compared to the theoretical values, the pyrolysis oil derived from the ternary blend exhibited increases of 17.74 % and 7.04 % in aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons, while the contents of N and O elements were reduced by 2.96 % and 2.54 %, respectively. The interaction mechanism and potential reaction pathways of CV with PS and NBG co-pyrolysis was proposed based on the reaction process. This study implies that CV co-pyrolyzed with PS and NBG could optimize energy output, providing theoretical and practical support for efficiently utilizing waste resources.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (polystyrene, nitrile butadiene gloves) and microalgae, with measurable product yields, kinetic analysis, and detailed product composition data."
"Catalytic cracking of LDPE over nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite prepared by seed-assisted synthesis from an organic-template-free system The catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) was accomplished using nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites. Nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolites were synthesized by a seed-assisted method from an organic-template-free system employing three different seeding strategies: two of these strategies based on aqueous clear solutions containing the ZSM-5 precursors (silanized and non-silanized) and the third strategy based on a commercial ZSM-5 zeolite in powder form. The plastic cracking reactions were carried out at 380–420°C, employing really mild conditions (plastic to catalyst mass ratio of 100). Nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites prepared by seed-induced synthesis based on liquid solutions exhibit a superior catalytic activity than the reference microcrystalline zeolite. Conversion values very close to 100% are achieved at 420°C, by using these catalysts, while significant conversion values (>50%) are still attained at 380°C. Moreover, these nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites promote the production of a high proportion of light olefins (>60% at 380°C), propylene, 1-butene, isobutene, being the main products (∼50%). Nanocrystalline HZSM-5 synthesized from a clear solution containing an organic structure-directing agent (TPA+) exhibits a 100% conversion value at 380°C. However, the economic and environmental advantages of the seed-assisted synthesis from a TPA+ free system and the remarkable activity showed by the nanocrystalline zeolites obtained, makes of these materials interesting catalysts in the LDPE catalytic cracking.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE using nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites, with measurable yields, temperature-dependent conversion, and product composition analysis."
Effect of Sb2O3 in brominated heating impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) on thermal degradation and debromination by iron oxide carbon composite catalyst (Fe-C) The iron oxide carbon composite catalyst (Fe-C) was prepared and used for catalytic debromination process during pyrolysis of heating impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) with various brominated flame retardants at 430°C into fuel oil. The effect of antimony oxide (Sb2O3: synergist) in HIPS-Br containing decabromo diphenyl oxide (DDO) and decabromo diphenyl ethane (DDE) as flame retardant was investigated. The thermal degradation of HIPS-Br produced various brominated hydrocarbons and also hydrobromic acid (HBr) in addition to various hydrocarbons. The synergist (Sb2O3) reacted with the hydrogen bromide evolved during the pyrolysis process and formed the SbBr3 in the liquid products. The presence of bromine content (organic and inorganic) in liquid products is not desirable to use as a fuel oil. The use of iron oxide carbon composite catalyst (Fe-C) during pyrolysis debrominated (ca. 99%) the bromine compounds from liquid products. The presence of Sb2O3 (5wt.%) decreased both the hydrogen bromide and brominated hydrocarbons by forming SbBr3 and produced high quantity of lower hydrocarbons (C7C11). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the presence of Sb2O3 in HIPS-Br decreased the degradation temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction results showed the presence of Fe3O4 phase in fresh Fe-C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) shows the presence of Sb and Br in used Fe-C catalyst in the degradation process.,"The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of brominated high-impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including TGA, XRD, SEM, and EDX."
"Organic template-free synthesis of fly ash-based ZSM-5 for economical closed-loop of hybrid plastics Multi-win strategy produces high-value chemicals from plastics through catalytic pyrolysis, alternative to the traditional petroleum route, which is of positive significance in realizing closed-loop recycling of plastics, white pollution control and low-carbon emission. Key work lies in the organic template-free synthesis of fly ash-based ZSM-5 (FAZ) zeolites for catalytic reforming process of mixed plastics. The zeolites were subjected to ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis with simulated mixed plastic particles (MPP) from municipal solid wastes, and the liquid yield of FAZ-2–48h was 42.7 wt%, which was 1.3 times that of commercial ZSM-5. The selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the reformulated oil was 84.3 %, and the C6-C12 distribution was 98.01 %. The synergistic reaction between hydrogen-rich polymers (LDPE, PP) and hydrogen-poor polymers (PS) in the ternary hybrid plastics promoted the formation of liquids. The liquid yield of FAZ zeolite for the catalytic reforming of the actual hybrid plastics was 24 wt%, with a MAHs selectivity of 86.5 %, and the percentage of C6-C12 was 99.7 %. The FAZ zeolite showed long-term stability in catalytic reforming experiments on mixed plastics, and the selectivity of MAHs was stabilized at 81 %, and this work provides an opportunity to realize high-value conversion and economic recycling of waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste using synthesized fly ash-based ZSM-5 zeolites, with measurable product yields, selectivity, and compositional analysis of hydrocarbons."
"Effect of volatile reactions on oil production and composition in thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene The volatiles generated from the pyrolysis of waste plastics undergo chemical reactions before being catalyzed to produce the plastic-derived oil. To reveal the relation between the oil properties and the volatile reactions, thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene – a main component in waste plastics – were studied at volatilization temperatures of 300–600 °C with a volatilization time of 17.7–53.0 s in a two-stage reactor. The yield and composition of the oil in both thermal and catalytic reactions were investigated. It was found that in thermal pyrolysis, a high volatilization temperature favors the cracking of volatiles, resulting in the decline of carbon chain length and the decrease of the oil yield. Extension of the volatilization time favors the formation of light oil at a volatilization temperature above 400 °C, but produce more long-chain fractions at a volatilization temperature of 300 °C. The carbon number distribution of the oil after catalysis is independent on the conditions for volatile reactions, but the yields of the oil and each fraction after catalysis are higher at a lower volatilization temperature and shorter volatilization time. The long-chain alkenes in the volatiles is responsible for the formation of the coke deposited on catalyst.","The study investigates thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene, a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis under controlled lab-scale reactor conditions."
"Recovery of high-grade copper from waste polyester imide enameled wires by pyrolysis and ultrasonic treatment Recovery of high-grade copper from waste enameled wires can effectively alleviate the shortage of copper resources. In this paper, the evolution of pyrolytic products during pyrolysis of waste polyester imide enameled wires was analyzed and the thermal decomposition mechanism was presented. A technology consisting pyrolysis and ultrasonic was proposed to achieve deep decarbonization. The results showed that the pyrolysis process was mainly divided into two stages. Below 500 °C, polyester imide was first depolymerized into large monomer, and then pyrolytic oil containing ketones, imides, amines and aromatic compounds was generated by random fracture (three main ways) and free radical reactions. With increase of temperature, the free radical reactions of small molecules to produce carbon and pyrolytic gas were dominant. The decarbonization efficiency reached 99.99% and the high-grade copper was obtained under the optimal conditions. This study provided the theoretical basis for recycling high-grade copper from waste enameled wires.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyester imide enameled wires (a plastic waste) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent decomposition mechanisms, and analytical characterization of pyrolytic products."
"Production of nanostructure carbon materials via non-oxidative thermal degradation of real polypropylene waste plastic using La2O3 supported Ni and Ni–Cu catalysts In this work real polypropylene (PP) waste plastic was used as a feedstock for synthesis of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) via a two-stage process. Lanthanum oxide (La2O3) was reported as a promising support for the active metals in thermocatalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons. This is due to the fact that it produces highly dispersed metal particles with an appropriate metal support interaction. Accordingly, La2O3 supported monometallic 50%Ni and bimetallic 40%Ni–10%Cu catalysts with the total metal content of 50 wt % were prepared and examined for the first time for the decomposition of non-condensable gases obtained from pyrolysis of PP to produce CNMs. The main target of this work is to study the impact of Cu addition on the yield and nature of as-deposited carbon product. The prepared catalysts were tested at the same pyrolysis and decomposition temperatures of 500 °C and 700 °C, respectively, and reaction time of 2.5 h. Various characterization techniques such as XRD, H2-TPR, BET surface area and FTIR were used to study the physicochemical properties of fresh catalysts. While, HR-TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and TGA-DTG techniques were employed on the spent catalysts to explore the nature, morphology, quality and thermal properties of CNMs product. It was observed that the bimetallic Ni–Cu/La2O3 catalyst exhibited higher surface area, higher metal dispersion as well as lower reduction temperature compared to the monometallic 50%Ni/La2O3 catalyst. These factors were found to be responsible for the improved catalytic growth activity of the 40%Ni–10%Cu/La2O3 catalyst in terms of carbon yield. The CNMs yield remarkably increased from 944% to 1458% after incorporating 10 wt% Cu in 40%Ni/La2O3 catalyst. TEM images showed that multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with regular diameters were formed over 50%Ni/La2O3 catalyst, while a mixture of large diameter carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and MWCNTs were produced over the 40%Ni–10%Cu/La2O3 catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real polypropylene waste plastic using catalysts, with measurable product yields, temperature conditions, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Suitable properties of the HY zeolite of NiW/HY catalysts for the hydroprocessing of a plastic pyrolysis oil/vacuum gas oil (PPO/VGO) blend The possibility of using oil refinery facilities for treating streams derived from consumers’ society wastes, such as plastics, is gaining relevance in recent times. This strategy would cover two goals at the same time: (i) improve the management of wastes reducing the landfilling and incineration rates, and (ii) integrate the conventional oil industry within the circular economy. In this context, the hydroprocessing of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) blended (10 wt%) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) was investigated. In particular, four different NiW/HY catalysts were prepared and the influence of HY zeolite with different SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios (80, 30, 12, and 5.1) for producing automotive fuel-like fractions was studied. The catalysts were characterized in detail by several techniques to correlate their performance with their main physico-chemical characteristics. The hydroprocessing runs were conducted in a batch reactor with continuous H2 feeding at 80 bar, 420 °C, catalyst-to-feed (C/F) mass ratio of 0.1 gcatalyst gfeed −1 and for 2 h long. Results exposed high differences in product distribution and composition. Overall, it was obtained that highly acidic catalysts with a high concentration of Brønsted-type acid sites with moderate acidic strength rule the process, but these acidic properties must be endorsed by adequate textural properties in a matter of high specific surface and wide pore sizes. According to this, the NiW/HY12 catalyst offered the best performance, since the highest hydrocracking conversion and sulfur removal were achieved while the production of naphtha and light cycle oil fractions was maximized. The higher hydrodearomatization and hydroisomerization activity of the NiW/HY30 catalyst made them appropriate to produce highly iso-paraffinic and poorly aromatic gasoline and LCO fractions.","The study involves the hydroprocessing of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO), a product derived from plastic pyrolysis, with experimental conditions, catalyst characterization, and measurable product yields and compositions reported."
"Recent advances in pyrolysis upcycling of waste plastics into hydrocarbon fuels on biochar-based catalysts Waste plastics, positioned between biomass and fossil fuels, hold great potential for valorization through upcycling technologies. However, it is still challenging to produce high-quality energy and chemicals from real-word commingling waste plastics. Catalytic pyrolysis demonstrates strong adaptability to mixed feedstocks, and the development of specialized catalysts is key to enhancing product quality. Among various catalysts, biochar-based catalysts stand out for their simple preparation and remarkable resistance to coke deposition. In this context, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics based on biochar-based catalysts was comprehensively and statistically analyzed by considering plastics feedstocks, pyrolysis reactors, reaction conditions, and catalyst development. This paper critically examines the mechanisms governing catalytic reaction during pyrolysis and analyzes the current challenges aimed at improving the yield and selectivity in the production of target products. In comparison to in-situ, the oil yield from ex-situ and microwave catalytic pyrolysis is notably higher. The coconut shell-based biochar with polymetallic modification under higher catalyst-to-feedstock ratios and lower reaction temperatures are more conducive to producing liquid oils. The free radical generation, carbocation reactions, and hydrogen transfer are the main mechanisms of waste plastics pyrolysis catalyzed by biochar-based catalysts. The Bronsted and Lewis acid centers on biochar-based catalysts, enhanced by biochar design, metal modification, and microwave heating, are key to determining the above reactions. Nonetheless, more efforts should be taken to design outstanding biochar-based catalysts and conversion systems by considering the environmental impacts and economic feasibility from intelligent and life-cycle aspects for scaling up to promote the sustainability and socio-economic benefits.","The abstract describes lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using biochar-based catalysts with measurable outcomes such as oil yield, reaction conditions, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Investigation on hydrogen-rich syngas production from catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and waste paper blends Urgent need for waste disposal and renewable energy have opened up promising pathways for renewable and sustainable fuel production to substitute traditional fossil fuels. In this study, catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste paper (WP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as typical municipal solid wastes was experimentally investigated towards hydrogen-rich syngas production. Results indicated the maximum H2 yield (429 μmol·gcat −1·min−1) was obtained with 60% PVC weight ratio under 900 °C which was higher than single component pyrolysis. Higher hydrogen yield (681.76 μmol·gcat −1·min−1) appeared over Fe/CeO2–CaO under the optimal conditions compared to that of Ru/ZSM-5-CaO (445.54 μmol·gcat −1·min−1). From the calculated non-isothermal kinetic parameters, both catalysts could reduce activation energies. Proper porous structure and CaO content in the catalyst could enhance hydrogen production via carbon species fixation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) and waste paper, with measurable hydrogen yield data, catalyst performance comparison, and reactor conditions reported."
"Waste catalysts for waste polymer Catalytic cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts (1:6 ratio) was carried out using a laboratory fluidized bed reactor operating at 450°C. Two fresh and two steam deactivated commercial FCC catalysts with different levels of rare earth oxide (REO) were compared as well as two used FCC catalysts (E-Cats) with different levels of metal poisoning. Also, inert microspheres (MS3) were used as a fluidizing agent to compare with thermal cracking process at BP pilot plant at Grangemouth, Scotland, which used sand as its fluidizing agent. The results of HDPE degradation in terms of yield of volatile hydrocarbon product are fresh FCC catalysts≫steamed FCC catalysts≈used FCC catalysts. The thermal cracking process using MS3 showed that at 450°C, the product distribution gave 46wt% wax, 14% hydrocarbon gases, 8% gasoline, 0.1% coke and 32% nonvolatile product. In general, the product yields from HDPE cracking showed that the level of metal contamination (nickel and vanadium) did not affect the product stream generated from polymer cracking. This study gives promising results as an alternative technique for the cracking and recycling of polymer waste.",The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data.
"Catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites produced by microwave-assisted chelation-alkaline treatment A new microwave (MW) assisted chelation-alkaline strategy was developed to produce hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites (with external surface area of 203 m2/g) in minutes, leading to the formation of heterogeneous structure with a high-silica shell and aluminium-rich core (silicon-to-aluminium ratios of 49.2 and 37.6, respectively). The zeolites were assessed comparatively by catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Compared to the mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the conventional alkaline treatment (via desilication by the NaOH aqueous solution), the hierarchical zeolite by the MW-assisted method showed comparable kinetics in catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, but with the improved stability in the cyclic pyrolysis-regeneration tests. The improved stability could be due to the better-preserved structural integrity thanks to the relatively milder surface etching by the MW-assisted chelation dealumination method. In addition, compared to the parent ZSM-5, the product distribution of HDPE catalytic pyrolysis over the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite showed a higher portion of oil products (i.e., 12 wt% vs. 6.9 wt%) and an improved alkane-to-olefin ratio in the oil products (2.22 vs. 1.86, respectively) due to the reduced acidity and improved hydrogen transfer ability. The MW-assisted chelation-alkaline treatment could be a new strategy to regulate the trade-off between stability and activity of zeolites for catalytic applications.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Characterization of pyrolysis oil produced from organic and plastic wastes using an auger reactor The objective of this study is to assess the suitability of pyrolysis oils produced from organic and plastic wastes for engine application. The assessment was performed by comparing the properties of the obtained pyrolysis oils with those of standard engine fuel. A fast pyrolysis process with an auger reactor was used to convert organic wastes such as beauty leaf fruit husk (BLFH), macadamia nutshell (MNS), and municipal green waste (MGW), and plastic waste such as waste high-density polythene (HDPE) into oil. Prior to pyrolysis experiments, all the wastes were characterized using a thermogravimetric and a CHNS analyser to perform proximate and ultimate analyses. The experiments were performed using varied temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 550 °C at intervals of 25 °C, a 3-minute residence time and 2-mm feedstock particle size. The maximum yield of pyrolysis oil was obtained at 475 °C for BLFH (42.75 %), at 500 °C for MNS (45.09 %) and MGW (44.72 %) and at 525 °C for HDPE (61.29 %). The chemical and physical properties of the pyrolysis oils were analysed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), elemental and physicochemical properties analysis. The characterisation results reveal that the pyrolysis oils obtained from BLFH, MNS and MGW are enriched with phenolic, aromatic, and oxygenated compounds and oil obtained from HDPE contains mostly hydrocarbons and aromatics. The BLFH, MNS and MGW derived oils have higher viscosity and density and lower calorific value compared to that of HDPE derived oil. Due to these features, the oils obtained from organic wastes are not suitable for engine application without further refinement. HDPE derived oil, on the other hand, meets most of the criteria to be an engine fuel. However, a firm conclusion cannot be drawn until this oil has been tested in an engine.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste HDPE plastic using an auger reactor with measurable yields, temperature-dependent results, and detailed product characterization."
"Pyrolysis of waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics and production of epoxy composites with their pyrolysis chars High density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic wastes were pyrolysed in the temperature range of 300–700 °C, liquid, gas and solid fractions (char) were quantified and pyrolysis char was used as additive in production of epoxy composite. Effects of pyrolysis temperature on products fractions, char quality and composite quality were investigated. In the composite composition, char was included as 10–50 wt% of epoxy to determine the effects of additive dosage on the composite quality. The char additives and produced composites were characterized by FTIR and SEM. Mechanical properties, namely tensile strength, surface hardness and electrical properties were determined for the epoxy composite materials. Epoxy composite materials produced with HDPE pyrolysis char additive obtained at 300 °C (ER300) showed the most ideal behavior in terms of elongation at break and tensile strength. With increasing pyrolysis temperature and char doses elongation at break and tensile strength of composites generally decreased. While tensile strength showed an increase by 32% at 10% wt% dose for composite (ER300) with HDPE char obtained at 300 °C, the increases were 21%, 14%, 14% and 13% for ER400-ER700 composites prepared with 10 wt% HDPE chars obtained at 400–700 °C pyrolysis temperatures, respectively. Despite this, LDPE chars a small decreased the tensile strength of epoxy. The hardness of neat epoxy was improved from 79.8 Shore D up to 86.3 and 87 Shore D by the LDPE and HDPE char additives, respectively.

"Pyrolysis of long chain hydrocarbon-based plastics via self-exothermic effects: The origin and influential factors of exothermic processes Converting plastic wastes into value-added products through energy-efficient pyrolysis is essential, and it requires lower pyrolysis temperatures and shorter processing times than that of other processes. An exothermic phenomenon was observed during the process high-pressure polyethylene pyrolysis. It was proven for the first time that the exotherm is caused by a pressure-induced phase transition, in which colossal heat release can be driven by relatively small pressures. A large temperature change (> 100 °C) leads to the deep cracking of polyethylene, although the set temperature is far lower than the required temperature for thermal cracking. Importantly, the heat input stops immediately when the set temperature is reached; thus, the external heating time is short. Polyethylene can be completely converted into liquid products in ~90 wt% yield and with a small number of gases. The self-exothermic phase transition only occurs within a certain range of material thickness, which is related to the corresponding phase behavior. In the self-exothermic pyrolysis process, with an increase in the thickness of polyethylene, the proportion of low-value olefins in oil products decreases gradually, while alkanes, isoalkanes and aromatics show an increasing trend, making the product composition closer to the fuel standard. This work provides a viable approach for plastic recycling at low pyrolysis temperatures and short external heating times with the help of a self-exothermic phase transition in the absence of a catalyst.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high-pressure polyethylene (a waste plastic) with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis, demonstrating self-exothermic effects and catalyst-free conversion to liquid products."
"Detailed analysis of olefins and diolefins in hydrotreated plastic waste pyrolysis oils by GC-VUV Recently, the hydrotreatment of plastic waste pyrolysis oils has been considered a promising route to remove heteroatoms and unsaturates from plastic pyrolysis oils to be used as steam cracking feedstock. As plastic waste pyrolysis oils differ vastly in composition from conventional crude oils, accurately identifying the different molecular species present in the mixture is essential to acquire further insights into their hydrogenation pathways. This work used gas chromatography coupled to a vacuum ultraviolet detector (GC-VUV) to obtain accurate quantification of (di)olefins compared to more conventional methods. It was found that there is no difference in intrinsic hydrogenation rates between diolefins and olefins, at least for chain lengths above C10. Moreover, an explicit dependency of the carbon chain length is identified on the hydrogenation rate for both olefins and diolefins with optimal hydrogenation rates up to C15. This is a consequence of the competition between hydrogenation and cracking reactions. Shorter unsaturated chains are thus formed because intrapore diffusional limitations prevent the hydrogenation of larger species. In addition, the degree of substitution (non-branched, methyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, etc.) of the unsaturated molecules mattered concerning the hydrogenation rate. Linear olefins were more rapidly hydrogenated than branched components. Apart from hydrogenation, skeletal isomerization reactions are also important, especially at high olefin conversions. These fundamental insights demonstrate the capability of GC-VUV to analyze hydrotreated plastic pyrolysis oils and provide essential knowledge for designing and optimizing the hydrotreatment processes of plastic waste pyrolysis oils.","The study involves lab-scale experimental work on hydrotreated plastic waste pyrolysis oils, with measurable product composition analysis using GC-VUV, including quantification of (di)olefins and hydrogenation rate dependencies on chain length and substitution."
"On-line photoionization mass spectrometric study of the catalytic pyrolysis of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer over HZSM-5, HUSY and Al-MCM-41 Three molecular sieve-based catalysts, HZSM-5, HUSY, and Al-MCM-41, were employed in the catalytic pyrolysis of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer. The on-line synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) together with pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to evaluate the performances of these catalysts in the catalytic pyrolysis processes, especially their denitrogenation ability on the pyrolysis oil. Based on the Py-GC/MS results, the formation of N-containing oligomers can be significantly suppressed with the presence of HZSM-5 and HUSY, over which a high content of Brønsted acid sites were detected. In contrast, although large amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be formed over Al-MCM-41, little effect was exhibited on the yields of major products owing to its inferior acidity. Given the relative production of light nitrogenous compounds, it can be concluded that HUSY is more applicable to the denitrogenation than HZSM-5. On account of the temperature-evolved profiles of the aromatic products acquired with SVUV-PIMS in real time, two different reaction paths were proposed for the catalytic pyrolysis over zeolite catalysts, by which the formation of valuable compounds can be clearly demonstrated, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and styrene. Moreover, it has been directly evidenced that the framework structure of HUSY can facilitate intermolecular hydrogen transfer to a great extent. This work highlights the superiority of SVUV-PIMS in the study of catalytic decomposition mechanisms of complex copolymers.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of ABS copolymer, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and real-time analytical characterization using SVUV-PIMS and Py-GC/MS."
"Employing CO2 as reaction medium for in-situ suppression of the formation of benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during pyrolysis of simulated municipal solid waste This study proposes a strategic principle to enhance the thermal efficiency of pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW). An environmentally sound energy recovery platform was established by suppressing the formation of harmful organic compounds evolved from pyrolysis of MSW. Using CO2 as reaction medium/feedstock, CO generation was enhanced through the following: 1) expediting the thermal cracking of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) evolved from the thermal degradation of the MSWs and 2) directly reacting VOCs with CO2. This particular influence of CO2 on pyrolysis of the MSWs also led to the in-situ mitigation of harmful organic compounds (e.g., benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) considering that CO2 acted as a carbon scavenger to block reaction pathways toward benzenes and PAHs in pyrolysis. To understand the fundamental influence of CO2, simulated MSWs (i.e., various ratios of biomass to polymer) were used to avoid any complexities arising from the heterogeneous matrix of MSW. All experimental findings in this study suggested the foreseeable environmental application of CO2 to energy recovery from MSW together with disposal of MSW.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of simulated municipal solid waste containing polymers, with measurable experimental data on product yields and suppression of harmful compounds using CO2 as a reaction medium."
"Oil and gas production from the pyrolytic transformation of recycled plastic waste: An integral study by polymer families Different plastics recovered from a local urban solid waste plant were collected before landfilling, separated, and classified by families, i.e. polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), high impact and expanded polystyrene (HIPS and EPS, respectively), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). A systematic pyrolysis study was carried out to compare the different behavior registered in each plastic type, and an integral analysis of the produced oils and synthetic gas was conducted. In general terms, the oil yield followed the order EPS > PP > PE > HIPS > PET > PVC, reaching maximum values over 500 °C after 1 h of treatment. The oil from HIPS, EPS, PET, and PP was rich in light compounds, i.e., C5-C9 hydrocarbons. Almost 100 % of the oil from HIPS and EPS pyrolysis was aromatic. The aromatic fraction was important in the case of PVC (57 %) and PET (45 %). PE produced an oil with the most varied distribution of compounds but rich in olefins (67 %). The analysis of the non-condensable composition of the gas showed that in all the pyrolysis gases methane was over 50 % (vol.), followed by ethane in importance. CO was produced in the case of PET.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, EPS, HIPS, PET, PVC) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Deactivation of a Y-zeolite based catalyst with coke evolution during the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene for fuel oil Coke evolution on a Y-zeolite based catalyst and its influence on the active site and catalytic activity during catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene for fuel oil were investigated. Results show that the coke evolution includes both quantity accumulation and structural condensation. The coke amounts increase from 0.8% at TOS = 1 h to 2.4% and 6.3% at TOS = 2 h and 4 h respectively, and the external coke deposits faster than the internal coke. Structural condensation is evidenced by DTG, H/C, 13C NMR, FTIR and UV-Vis results. The average coke model changes from a tricyclic aromatic to a hexacyclic alkyl aromatic as TOS increases from 1 h to 4 h. Coke evolution causes catalyst deactivation, resulting in the decrease of oil yields but increase of wax yields and heavy oil concentration. The strong acid sites and micropores favor the coke deposition, and fast external deposition leads to slow decrease of acidities with coke yields.","The study investigates catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene, a waste plastic, using lab-scale experiments with measurable product yields, catalyst deactivation, and analytical characterization of coke evolution."
"Enhanced diesel fuel fraction from waste high-density polyethylene and heavy gas oil pyrolysis using factorial design methodology Factorial Design Methodology (FDM) was developed to enhance diesel fuel fraction (C9–C23) from waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and Heavy Gas Oil (HGO) through co-pyrolysis. FDM was used for optimization of the following reaction parameters: temperature, catalyst and HDPE amounts. The HGO amount was constant (2.00g) in all experiments. The model optimum conditions were determined to be temperature of 550°C, HDPE=0.20g and no FCC catalyst. Under such conditions, 94% of pyrolytic oil was recovered, of which diesel fuel fraction was 93% (87% diesel fuel fraction yield), no residue was produced and 6% of noncondensable gaseous/volatile fraction was obtained. Seeking to reduce the cost due to high process temperatures, the impact of using higher catalyst content (25%) with a lower temperature (500°C) was investigated. Under these conditions, 88% of pyrolytic oil was recovered (diesel fuel fraction yield was also 87%) as well as 12% of the noncondensable gaseous/volatile fraction. No waste was produced in these conditions, being an environmentally friendly approach for recycling the waste plastic. This paper demonstrated the usefulness of using FDM to predict and to optimize diesel fuel fraction yield with a great reduction in the number of experiments.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste HDPE and heavy gas oil with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical optimization using factorial design methodology."
"Heating strategies for the system of PP and Spherical Activated Carbon during microwave cracking for obtaining value-added products Microwave catalytic cracking of waste plastics is a promising technology. However, how to mix effectively microwave absorber, catalyst and feedstock, and reuse microwave absorbers and catalysts is obviously a challenge. This study has focused on the heat transfer performance and reuse of microwave absorber and the influence of heating strategies on cracked products. Commercial Spherical Activated Carbon (SAC), containing some catalysts, has been used for microwave cracking of polypropylene. The effect of heating strategies on product distribution has been studied. Meanwhile, SAC has been reused many times to test the possibility of industrialization of the system. The results show that the heating strategies such as reducing the input power, choosing appropriate intermittent heating time and co-cracking of PP-Wax are beneficial to the formation of light oil. Compared with the first use, the subsequent heating rate of SAC will decrease, but the average heating rate shows a certain stability in the subsequent multiple use (the change range <1 °C/min at 32% input power). From the point of view of heat transfer and reuse, SAC has obvious advantages as microwave absorber. However, the catalytic performance is not significant and needs to be improved in the next study.","The study involves microwave catalytic cracking of waste polypropylene using spherical activated carbon as a microwave absorber and catalyst, with measurable product distribution and reuse performance data."
"Production of aromatic hydrocarbons by catalytic co-pyrolysis of microalgae and polypropylene using HZSM-5 In the current study, the thermogravimetric behavior of Nannochloropsis sp. (NS), polypropylene (PP) and mixed samples (NS: PP = 1:1) with and without catalyst were investigated by TGA analysis. To promote the efficient production of aromatic hydrocarbons, co-pyrolysis of NS and PP over the HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst were carried out in a bench-scaled fixed bed reactor. The effects of the reaction temperature (500–900 °C), NS/PP mass ratio (1:0, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2,1:3 and 0:1) and feedstock/catalyst mass ratio (1:0-1:10) on the relative content of aromatics were investigated. The results showed that the catalytic co-pyrolysis of NS and PP exhibited a synergistic effect on the generation of aromatic hydrocarbons compared to their individual pyrolysis. The relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons compounds and mass yield of monoaromatic hydrocarbons in oil from catalytic co-pyrolysis of NS and PP with HZSM-5 could reach to 77.04 area%, and 0.1223 g/(g·sample), respectively. Based on chemical composition analysis of the oil, the mechanisms for the formation of major aromatic hydrocarbons during the catalytic co-pyrolysis of NS and PP were further discussed.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) and microalgae in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields, temperature-dependent results, and product composition analysis."
"The catalytic performance for LDPE destruction over aluminum-incorporated mesoporous silicates The aim of this study was to investigate the aluminum-incorporated mesoporous silicate (Al-MPS) as a thermal catalyst for the destruction of low density polyethylene (LDPE). Various Al-MPS (Si/Al molar ratios=117.6, 58.8, 39.2 and 29.4) materials were successfully synthesized without any structural damage. With regard to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, the main peak of 2θ =64.0 in Al2O3 did not show until the incorporation of Si/Al=58.8. This result implies the aluminum ions were stably substituted into the silicon site of the mesoporous framework. The hexagonal straight pore size increased to about 8.0nm in Al (Si/Al=58.8)-MPS, but then decreased in the range of 3.0–5.0nm in Al (Si/Al=29.4)-MPS. In relation to the amount of incorporated aluminum, the Al-MPS absorbed many pyridine molecules, implying the acidities on the external surfaces up to Si/Al=58.8, but this amount decreased somewhat above a Si/Al ratio of 39.2. The catalytic decomposition of LDPE was enhanced in Al (Si/Al=58.8)-MPS and particularly, the selectivity to light hydrocarbons below C4 reached 43%.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE using synthesized Al-MPS catalysts, with measurable product selectivity to light hydrocarbons and catalyst performance data reported."
"Pyrolysis of end-of-life polystyrene in a pilot-scale reactor: Maximizing styrene production Chemical recycling of polystyrene (PS) via pyrolysis is of great industrial, and academic interest, with styrene being the primary product of interest. To identify the optimal process conditions, the pyrolysis of end-of-life PS was studied in a pilot-scale unit consisting of an extruder, and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The PS was pyrolyzed with continuous feeding at a pressure range from 0.02 to 1.0bara, and a temperature range from 450 to 600 °C, giving primarily styrene, other mono-aromatics, and oligomers. The comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) coupled with flame ionization detector (FID), and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ToF-MS) as well as GC with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) were used to characterize the liquid, and gaseous products exhaustively. The styrene yield increased from 36 wt% at 1.0bara, and 450 °C to 56 wt% at 0.02bara, and 550 °C. Working under a vacuum enhanced the styrene recovery at all corresponding temperature levels. The yield of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) increased from 4 wt% at 450 °C, and 0.02 bara to 17 wt% at 450 °C, and 1.0 bara. The experimental results have been used in a mathematical model that can explain the combined effect of temperature, and pressure on the yield of the primary products. The present work illustrates the potential of a continuous pyrolysis process for end-of-life PS, and paves the way for this technology to be rapidly transferred from mere laboratory use to industrial processes in the circular (petro-) chemical industry.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of end-of-life polystyrene in a pilot-scale reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–pressure relationships, and comprehensive analytical characterization of liquid and gaseous products."
"Preparation of highly selective olefins from pyrolyzed ground film plastics catalyzed by fishbone-based catalysts Ground film plastic, widely used in large-scale agriculture, is a major source of persistent white pollution due to its poor degradability. This work investigates the pyrolysis process of agricultural plastic mulch using a modified fishbone-derived metal catalyst combined with microwave-assisted pyrolysis. Experimental data indicate that the 5Cu/HAP fishbone catalyst exhibits optimal catalytic performance. The ideal pyrolysis conditions are: pyrolysis temperature of 550°C, catalytic temperature of 350°C, and a catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 1:2. Under these conditions, an 80.30 wt% liquid oil yield was achieved, with maximum olefin selectivity reaching 63.92 % and a 90.80 % selectivity of C6∼C12 olefins. These results demonstrate the significant potential of catalytic pyrolysis using modified fishbone-derived metal catalysts for converting agricultural plastic waste into C6∼C12 olefins. These olefins can be further processed into high-purity chemicals like naphtha and gasoline. As olefins are also essential plastic raw materials, this approach enables a potential closed-loop film-to-olefin-to-film recycling cycle, offering a promising new pathway for the chemical recycling of plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of agricultural plastic mulch with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis under defined conditions."
"Thermo-chemical disposal of plastic waste from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) using CO2 The source reduction of plastic waste could be an effective means to attenuate hazardous environmental problems triggered by microplastics. Energy recovery from plastic waste through thermochemical processes is a desirable valorization route. To realize the grand challenges, plastic waste derived from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) was pyrolyzed. To propose a greener feature, CO2 was introduced as a mediator to maximize carbon allocation to the gaseous pyrogenic product (syngas) by CO2 reduction to CO and concurrent oxidation of volatile matter (VM) that was evolved from the thermolysis of plastic waste. As such, fundamental and systematic works were conducted to delineate the CO2 effects on conversion of VMs. This study experimentally proved that CO2 promotes thermal cracking in line with C–C bond scissions. However, the reaction rate for the conversion of CO2 and VM into CO via homogeneous reaction was not fast. Therefore, a Ni-based catalyst was employed to accelerate the reaction rate. However, there was coke deposition on the catalyst surface. To prevent coke formation, we chose a method to enhance CO2 reduction to CO and the oxidation of VM. Thus, three bimetallic catalysts were used for catalytic pyrolysis. Among the three bimetallic catalysts, Rh0.1Ni1/SiO2 was the most effective.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste from end-of-life vehicles with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of reaction products."
"Catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene over H-Beta and HZSM-5 zeolites: Influence of the external surface. Kinetic model The effect of the addition of H-Beta and HZSM-5 zeolites on the pyrolysis of commercial LDPE has been studied using dynamic experiments in a thermobalance. The H-Beta zeolite shows an important influence on the decomposition of the polymer even at a very low zeolite concentration. A remarkable effect in the first steps of LDPE decomposition on increasing the catalyst loading has been observed and a two-step process occurs in the presence of H-Beta zeolite. A pseudo-kinetic model has been proposed in order to adequately reproduce this behaviour. The model developed has been applied to simultaneously correlate the TG and DTG curves obtained under dynamic conditions at heating rates of 5, 10 and 35°C/min and at several catalyst concentrations. The model is capable of simultaneously correlating all the experiments, thus demonstrating the validity of the hypothesis suggested and revealing a notable ability as a predictive model.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of commercial LDPE using H-Beta and HZSM-5 zeolites with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and kinetic modeling based on TG/DTG data."
"Conceptual design of a distillation process for the separation of styrene monomer from polystyrene pyrolysis oil: experiment and simulation This study presents experiments and modeling of batch distillation for the separation of styrene monomer from polystyrene pyrolysis oil. The bottoms obtained from the batch distillation was further fractionated applying a short-path distillation unit to study the separation efficiency of styrene from the polystyrene pyrolysis oil. GC-FID and GCMS were applied for the composition analysis of the polystyrene pyrolysis oil, distillate, and bottom fractions. Styrene monomer was obtained with a purity of 99.9 wt% from the batch distillation. The batch distillation was modeled employing the NRTL–RK thermodynamic model. A good agreement was achieved for the purity of styrene between the experimental analysis and model prediction. Additionally, a continuous distillation column was modeled for the scale-up of the process. Furthermore, viscosities and densities of the bottoms fraction were measured at the temperature range of 298–348 K.","The study involves pyrolysis of polystyrene, a commercial plastic, with experimental characterization of pyrolysis oil and its fractions, including measurable product yields and composition analysis."
"Photo-thermal catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: Investigation into light-induced metal-support interaction A novel photo-thermal catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE was conducted with a solar simulator for effective and energy-conserving production. Four photothermal catalysts, including TiO2, NiTi(Ni/TiO2), NiAl(Ni/Al2O3) and NiTiAl(Ni/TiO2/Al2O3), were prepared to study the performance on gas and carbonaceous production at variant temperatures (500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C). NiTiAl reached carbon nanotubes(CNTs) yield of 280 mg/gplastics with simultaneous hydrogen yield of 54 mmol/g even at 700 °C. For the better understanding of light-induced carbon deposition and hydrogen evolution, pyrolysis in pure thermal mode was also carried out over NiTiAl for comparison, where H2 production of 28 mmol/g and little carbon product was found. It turns out that the introduction of irradiation together with support component deliberately mediated the metal-support interaction in NiTiAl by certain photoelectrons transfer, which was favorable for CNTs growth and hydrogen evolution. It is expected to provide a design strategy of catalysts in solar pyrolysis of carbonaceous feedstock.","The study involves lab-scale photo-thermal catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE waste plastic with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and reactor conditions."
"Aromatic hydrocarbons production and synergistic effect of plastics and biomass via one-pot catalytic co-hydropyrolysis on HZSM-5 The catalytic co-hydropyrolysis of pine sawdust (PW) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) to selectively produce aromatic hydrocarbons was studied by optimizing reaction parameters (feedstock composition, reaction temperature, residue time, initial hydrogen pressure and catalyst to reactant ratio). The composition of feedstocks, reaction temperature and the ratio of catalyst to reactant all had significant effects on the content of aromatic hydrocarbons, and the appropriate reaction parameters were selected to maximize the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. The maximum aromatic hydrocarbons yield (18.3 %) and the highest selectively (67.8 %) were obtained when the ratio of plastic to reactant was 0.6, 400 °C, 1.5 MPa for 1 h and the catalyst to reactant ratio was 0.2. Compared with hydropyrolysis of biomass, the addition of plastics reduced the yield of solid residue and the oxygen content in bio-oil. Characteristic analysis of bio-oil showed that that monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for the majority of aromatic hydrocarbons in blends, with benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) having the highest selectivity (51.6–70.6 %), and oxygenates were almost absent in bio-oil. Meanwhile, the possible reaction pathways in the co-hydropyrolysis of biomass and plastic for aromatic hydrocarbons were discussed extensively.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-hydropyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) and biomass, with measurable yields, reaction conditions, and product composition analysis."
"From end-of-life tires to storable energy carriers End-of-life tires are an increasingly important environmental burden. Since retreading is only partly possible, safe and economic methods of disposal need to be developed. Pyrolysis of ELTs, and subsequent upgrading/application of the produced energy carriers, is considered a valuable treatment method. In order to design the process, numerous operation units have to be taken into account. Char, vapour and gas are formed in the reactor. The char is purified from ZnO with a leaching process. The pyrolysis vapour is separated into a condensable fraction (oil) and a non-condensable fraction (gas) thanks to a cross-flow condenser with air as indirect cooling medium. The remaining gas is compressed to 6 bar: a part of it is continuously converted in electricity for process use, while another part is stored for power generation at peak demand time. A flowsheet of the process is established and environmental and assessment of investments and production are discussed. For the pyrolytic treatment of 3 ton/hr of ELTs, the required heat for the reactor is 271 kW at 380 °C, provided by electrical heating elements. A reactor volume is determined for a residence time of about 6 h. For the cross-flow condenser, indirectly air-cooled, a heat-transfer area of about 13.2 m2 is required. The compression of the gas the pressurized pyrolytic gas storage tank depends upon the excess pyrolytic gas produced during operation. The char cooler requires a heat-transfer area of 10.2 m2, when indirectly cooled by water. Operating parameters of the leaching and subsequent recovery of Zn2+ complete the design. The product added-value and the large-scale capacity make the process economically viable, although the ROI is between 2 and 3 years.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of end-of-life tires, with measured reactor conditions, product yields, and analytical characterization of outputs such as oil, gas, and char."
"Deactivation dynamics of a Ni supported catalyst during the steam reforming of volatiles from waste polyethylene pyrolysis The valorization of waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) for hydrogen production has been studied in a two-step process, comprising pyrolysis and subsequent steam reforming of the volatiles produced in the first step. Particularly, this work focuses on the deterioration mechanisms (sintering and coke deposition) of the Ni commercial catalyst used in the second step, as it conditions the overall process performance. Pyrolysis of HDPE has been performed in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500°C, and the catalytic steam reforming of the pyrolysis volatiles, in a fluidized bed reactor at 700°C. Deactivated catalyst samples were recovered at different values of time on stream, and characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, SEM and TEM electronic microscopies, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), Raman, FTIR and LDI-TOF MS spectroscopies. The results show that the deactivation is due to the sintering and encapsulation -by coke- of Ni. The former is inevitable within the current conditions, and the latter can be ascribed to the condensation of adsorbed precursors that evolve over time. Encapsulating coke is partially carbonized into filamentous coke with lower effect on catalytic deactivation and higher economic interest.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500°C, followed by catalytic steam reforming, with measurable experimental data including catalyst characterization, product analysis, and deactivation dynamics."
"Effects of 2H-heptafluoropropane on the liquid and tar products of poly(methylmethacrylate) flash pyrolysis The flash pyrolysis of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) granules in nitrogen and 2H-heptafluoropropane (HFP) atmosphere were carried out in a tube-type pyrolyzer at 700°C, respectively. The liquid and tar products were transported by the continuous flowing environmental gases, and collected by Cambridge pad. The products were detected and identified by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results indicate that the liquid and tar products mainly consist of some aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the distributions of pyrolysis products in HFP atmosphere are rather different from that in nitrogen atmosphere. The presence of HFP results in an obvious concentration decrease of most oxygenated aromatic compounds, as well as an increase of almost all the aromatic hydrocarbons. The mechanisms of the changes are discussed from the aspect of reaction pathways.","The study involves lab-scale flash pyrolysis of PMMA, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields and composition analysis via GC/MS under controlled reactor conditions."
"Catalytic fast pyrolysis of low density polyethylene into naphtha with high selectivity by dual-catalyst tandem catalysis In this work, catalytic fast pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE) into highly valuable naphtha by the relay catalysis (Al2O3 followed by ZSM-5 zeolite) was conducted. Effects of different catalysts, pyrolysis temperatures, catalyst to plastic ratio, and Al2O3 to ZSM-5 ratio, on product distribution and selectivity were studied. Al2O3 shows an excellent performance for catalytic reforming of LDPE pyrolysis vapors, mainly producing C5-C23 olefins that are the important precursors to form aromatics via Diels-Alder, aromatization, and polymerization reactions in the pores of ZSM-5 catalyst. Experimental results also show that the selectivity of monoaromatics and C5-C12 alkanes/olefins can be up to 100% over Al2O3 followed by ZSM-5 relay catalysis at the temperature of 550 °C, the catalyst to plastic ratio of 4:1, and Al2O3 to ZSM-5 ratio of 1:1. The product (monoaromatics and C5-C12 alkanes/olefins), naphtha, could be a renewable feedstock for new plastic production in the petroleum industry so that this finding might provide a new insight for a circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic fast pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis at specific reactor conditions."
"Kinetic study of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolysis In this study, 15mg samples of high density polyethylene (HDPE) were pyrolysed in an isothermal thermogravimetric set-up in a micro-thermobalance reactor with pre-set temperatures. The objective was to study the thermal degradation behaviour of the polymer and determine the kinetic rate constants and overall activation energy (E o). Yielded pyrolysis products under different temperatures were analyzed and lumped into the following categories: rich gases (C 1 –C 4), liquids (non-aromatic C 5 –C 10), aromatics (single ring structures), waxes ( C 11) and char. It was observed that the gas yield was increasing with the operating temperature. Data obtained enabled us to propose a novel kinetic modelling approach based on the thermal cracking of the polymer by primary and secondary depolymerisation reactions to form the pyrolysis products. The E o was estimated to be 147.25kJmol−1 for the total conversion of HDPE in isothermal pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic with measured product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and kinetic characterization using a micro-thermobalance reactor."
"Catalytic stepwise pyrolysis for dechlorination and chemical recycling of PVC-containing mixed plastic wastes: Influence of temperature, heating rate, and catalyst The viability of pyrolysis technology for chemical recycling of plastics is challenged by the presence of PVC in real-world mixed plastic wastes. This study aims to investigate catalytic stepwise pyrolysis as a pretreatment step to remove chlorine from PVC-containing plastic wastes prior to further processing. TG-FTIR and Py-GCMS analysis as well as experiments on a lab-scale pyrolysis system were conducted to study the influence of key processing parameters on the pretreatment including temperature, heating rate, and catalysts. Py-GCMS results indicated 300 °C to be the best pretreatment temperature in terms of balancing Cl removal and avoidance of organochloride formation. Metal oxides, i.e., CaO and Fe2O3, mainly acted as adsorbents of HCl gases with little cracking effect, and their adsorption effects are positively correlated with alkalinity. ZSM-5 catalysts promoted the release of HCl, and the dechlorination effect was more pronounced with ZSM-5 of higher acidity. In contrast, in the lab-scale pyrolysis system, 350 °C pretreatment achieved the highest HCl generation ratio, i.e., 43.60 %. The addition of zeolite catalyst significantly reduced the content of organochloride in the pyrolysis oil in contrast to the performance of metal oxides, but also absorbed most HCl instead of promoting HCl release as in Py-GCMS tests. Mass balance analyses revealed that the majority of chlorine was retained in the solid residues following the catalytic stepwise pyrolysis process, with the notable exception of Fe2O3. ZSM-5(25) catalyst combined with 350 °C pretreatment temperature and 550 °C final pyrolysis achieved the lowest chlorine content in the pyrolysis oil, i.e., 20 ppm, among different process conditions.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of PVC-containing mixed plastic waste with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Investigation on chlorine migration during pyrolysis of medical waste Large quantities of physiological saline and polyvinyl chloride fragments constitute the primary sources of chlorine within medical waste. During the thermochemical treatment of medical waste, they induce severe corrosion and degradation of product quality. A combined TG-MS-FTIR analysis of 13 representative medical waste types, including plastics, rubber, and cellulose materials, along with their mixtures, revealed a signature five-stage co-pyrolysis process. Free radicals from fibrous dehydration aided plastic scission and lignin cleavage, while polymer melt inhibited secondary fiber reactions. NaCl catalyzed fibrous decarboxylation but hindered hydrocarbons. Fixed-bed tests showed chlorine migration intensely temperature-dependent, with under 500 °C critical for dechlorination. Crucially, 20.06 % of liquid-phase chlorine here existed as chlorinated esters, confirming co-pyrolysis alters speciation via ester exchange. Even at 700 °C, 25.95 % char chlorine remained organic; gas-phase enrichment rose to 44 % by 800℃. Introducing hematite catalyst proved highly effective. Its surface lattice oxygen mediated C-Cl cleavage, reducing chlorinated ester yield by 6.3 % at 500 °C and decreasing chlorine content in the liquid-phase product by 5 %. Hematite also enhanced tar secondary cracking, boosting gas yield and raising renewable gas calorific value by 19.34 %. XRD confirmed stable FeCl3 formation. By synergizing hematite catalysis with the optimized pyrolysis temperature profile, this study achieved targeted volatile chlorine enrichment and significant suppression of key chlorinated residues. This offers innovative theoretical and technological support for sustainable chlorine pollution mitigation during medical waste pyrolysis resource recovery.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of medical waste containing polyvinyl chloride, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent chlorine migration, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including FTIR, XRD, and GC–MS."
"Valorization of waste polystyrene and palm biomass via co-pyrolysis for gasoline-range fuel production supporting low-carbon transition Palm fronds (PF), a common byproduct of the oil palm industry, and waste expanded polystyrene (EPS), a long-lasting plastic pollutant, were co-valorized through pyrolysis to generate gasoline-range hydrocarbons. This study explored various feed ratios to assess the yield and composition of pyrolysis oil produced from the co-pyrolysis of PF and EPS at 500 °C for 2 h. The resulting pyrolysis oil was primarily composed of hydrocarbons in the C6–C11 range, with boiling points reaching up to 215 °C, as determined by simulated distillation. Increasing the proportion of EPS in the feed led to a higher production of pyrolysis oil and reduced the aqueous phase. A feed ratio of PF to EPS of 1:2 yielded approximately 64.67 % pyrolysis oil. Furthermore, the addition of EPS as a co-feed enhanced the carbon content of the char to approximately 82 % while also reducing its ash content. The result offers potential for the production of liquid fuels from a mixture of agricultural byproducts and plastic waste, which contributes to the circular economy initiatives and promotes low-carbon strategies.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polystyrene and palm biomass, with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Defluidization phenomena during the pyrolysis of two plastic wastes A couple of commercially available packaging-derived fuels, both obtained as a result of mono-material recycling programs of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were fed in a laboratory scale bubbling fluidized-bed reactor, made of quartz. The effect of the main operating variables (bed solids hold-up, inert material size, fluidizing velocity, plastics feed rate) on the agglomeration and the defluidization phenomena was investigated by means of experiments carried out in the bed temperature range of 450–650°C. Different mechanisms of defluidization were identified and characterized. The time at which defluidization occurred was correlated to the ratio between the bed solids hold-up and the polymer feed rate by means of linear relationships. An increase of this ratio, as well as a decrease of the bed temperature, led to a decrease of the defluidization time for both the recycled polymers. No substantial effects were found in the tested range of fluidizing gas velocities. An operating criterion to avoid defluidization was finally proposed.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE and PET) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable experimental data on defluidization time, reactor conditions, and product behavior."
"High quality products from microwave catalytic pyrolysis of heavy oil and polyethylene Heavy hydrocarbon residue management has always been an environmental issue; thus, it is essential to find a method for upgrading heavy oils and plastic waste to high quality products as an alternative source of chemicals and fuels. In this study, the microwave catalytic pyrolysis (MCP) of heavy oil (HO) and LDPE (as plastic source) was proposed by employing a unique design of the catalyst, SiC foam@HZSM-5. This special catalyst design provided sufficient mass and heat transfer and enhanced the available catalyst surface area during the pyrolysis process. The effect of microwave power and the HO:LDPE ratio were investigated to optimize the product yield and quality. The results showed that the hazardous and unwanted elements of HO were eliminated by adding LDPE to the feedstock. More importantly, it was observed that the secondary and side reactions were accelerated due to a positive synergistic effect ( Δ Y ), which occurred because of hydrogen donors from the LDPE degradation and the non-thermal effect of microwave heating. The HO:LDPE ratio of 1:1 with a microwave power of 800 W and 10 min heating time were the optimum conditions; the liquid yield was about 42 wt% with around 90% of aromatics (mono- and polycyclic) relative concentration. Furthermore, the proportion of BTX was about 82% of the liquid oil, while the concentration of oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds was less than 2%. Under the above conditions, the proportion of collected non-condensable gases was around 46 wt%, which comprised light olefins (C1-C6) at about 37%, and a considerable proportion of H2 as well. Additionally, adding more LDPE to the feedstock decreased solid residue by promoting the conversion of HO, which improved catalyst efficiency.","The study involves microwave catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) and heavy oil, with measured product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of neem sawdust and high-density polyethylene towards aromatic-rich bio-oil: Significance of zeolite mesopores Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic was conducive to aromatics-rich bio-oil production, though the significance of zeolite mesopores in co-pyrolysis was still lacking and required further investigation. Herein, a conventional ZSM-5 and its two mesoporous deviants (hollow HS-ZSM-5 and core–shell hierarchical ZSM-5@SBA-15) were synthesized and utilized as catalysts in the co-pyrolysis of neem sawdust (NS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Results showed that compared to ZSM-5, both the mesoporous zeolites enhanced aromatics production. And HS-ZSM-5 with an interior mesoporous cavity performed better in improving the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) fraction. An optimization of co-pyrolysis conditions (e.g., HDPE percentage, catalyst loading, co-pyrolysis temperature) further improved the MAHs selectivity to 33.8 area%. The synergy between NS and HDPE over mesoporous zeolites was also compared. While the aromatization between short-chain olefins was dominant in aromatics production over ZSM-5@SBA-15, the Diels–Alder reaction between NS-derived furans and HDPE-derived olefins contributed more in that over HS-ZSM-5.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and neem sawdust using catalytic pyrolysis with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity data."
"Pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming of polystyrene through a two-step reaction system Hydrogen production from polystyrene (PS) has been studied following continuous pyrolysis and in-line steam reforming. The first step was carried out at 500°C in a conical spouted bed reactor and the subsequent reforming one was performed in a fluidized bed reactor on a commercial Ni catalyst at 700°C. The effect space time and time on stream have on the reaction indexes (reforming conversion, yields of H2, CO2, CO, CH4 and hydrocarbons, and H2 production) has been determined. Furthermore, the process performance has been compared with the results obtained in a previous study conducted by feeding HDPE under the same conditions. Full reforming of PS derived volatiles and high H2 production of 29.1 wt% were attained at zero time on stream. However, a significantly poorer performance of the catalyst was observed after 100min continuous operation, with the decrease in activity being more acute than that observed for HDPE in a previous study. This deactivating behaviour has been related to the aromatic nature of PS thermal degradation products. The cokes deposited in the degradation of PS and HDPE have been analysed by means of temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and electron microscopy, and the higher deactivation rate observed in the case of PS has been related to the condensed and encapsulating nature of the coke formed from aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) in a conical spouted bed reactor followed by in-line catalytic steam reforming, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Polyolefin-derived substrate-grown carbon nanotubes as binder-free electrode for hydrogen evolution in alkaline media Switching from a linear mode of waste management to a circular loop by transforming plastic waste into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a promising approach to current plastic waste treatment. One of the many applications of CNTs is its use for electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution. Existing methods of CNTs-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode fabrication involve additives like polymeric binders and additional steps to improve CNT dispersion, which are detrimental to the CNT structure and properties. The in-situ fabrication approach can potentially be a one-pot solution to HER electrode synthesis. In this study, polyolefins pyrolysis gas and a Co:Ni:Mg catalyst were used to fabricate binder-free CNTs-based electrodes on different substrates for HER. The study assessed CNT quality on conductive carbon paper, semiconductive silicon, and dielectric glass substrates, evaluating their HER performance in 1 M KOH. A mixture of hollow-core, bamboo-like, and cup-stacked arrangement nanotubes were synthesized on the substrates, with CNTs on glass and carbon paper substrates possessing better graphitization than CNTs grown on silicon. This is in agreement with HER performance, whereby the as-prepared electrodes required overpotentials of 267 mV, 241 mV, and 216 mV for silicon, glass, and carbon paper, respectively, to achieve 10 mA/cm2. Despite being poorly conductive, the glass substrate electrode achieved a lower overpotential than the silicon electrode. Additionally, the as-prepared silicon electrode faced a delamination issue likely attributed to the lower surface energy of the silicon substrate surface, demonstrating the weaker adhesion between the CNTs and silicon surface. The proposed approach thus showed that the in-situ fabricated electrodes performed better than separately synthesized CNTs prepared into electrodes by 27.4% and 14.2% for carbon paper and glass substrates, respectively. The improved performance of the as-prepared, binder-free electrodes can be linked to the lower charge-transfer resistance and reduced contact resistance between the CNTs and substrate.","The study involves pyrolysis of polyolefin waste plastics to produce carbon nanotubes, with measurable experimental data on catalyst performance, CNT morphology, and HER overpotentials."
"Catalytic fast pyrolysis of a wood-plastic composite with metal oxides as catalysts The catalytic fast pyrolysis of a poplar wood-polypropylene composite (WPP) was investigated using Py-GC/MS in the presence of ZnO, CaO, Fe2O3 and MgO. The synergistic effects between wood and plastic components in both non-catalytic and ZnO-catalyzed pyrolysis of WPP were studied. CaO facilitated the removal of oxygen due to its strong basicity, eliminating carboxylic acids and phenols from the products, while slightly increasing cyclopentanones and alkenes. MgO has weaker deoxygenation but stronger chain scission activities versus CaO, and significantly enhanced the alkene yields. Alkene yields were highest using ZnO among the four catalysts. ZnO increased ketone and phenol yields while reducing carboxylic acids. Aromatics were identified in the presence of Fe2O3. A synergistic effect between poplar wood and PP in the uncatalyzed pyrolysis of WPP increased the yields of carboxylic acids, phenols and light alkenes, while it reduced carbonyl-containing oxygenates such as aldehydes, ketones and furans. The synergy in the ZnO-catalyzed pyrolysis of WPP further enhanced the formation of monomeric phenols and alkenes.",The study involves catalytic fast pyrolysis of a polypropylene-based plastic composite with measurable product yields and catalyst performance analysis.
"Infrared heated co-pyrolysis behavior of polyethylene and corn stover via optimization of secondary reactions Infrared-fast pyrolysis (IF) has proven effective for examining the co-pyrolysis behavior of polyethylene (PE) and corn stover (CS) by optimizing secondary reactions. In this study, a fixed-bed reactor with fast infrared heating was adopted to explore the distribution of pyrolysis products and compare the product compositions generated by IF with those produced by electric-conventional slow pyrolysis (ECS). Increasing the PE ratio first increased the oil yield and then reduced it at 600 °C during the co-pyrolysis process by IF. The maximum oil yield produced by IF in PE50%-CS50% was 1.6 times the calculated yield, whereas the oil generated by ECS were roughly comparable to the calculated amount. Owing to the sluggish heating rate in ECS, the pyrolysis volatiles experienced a prolonged residence time in the high-temperature area, resulting in a severe secondary reaction and large variations in H2 and CO2 content. The highest H2 content in PE75%-CS25% was 18.09 vol%, which was 3.4 times the calculated value. The lowest CO2 content was 45.7 vol% in PE50%-CS50%, which was 27% less than predicted. During IF, The phenols, ketones, acids, aldehydes, and polyaromatic rings gradually decreased as the PE ratio increased, while the alcohol and ester content initially increased and then decreased. The alcohol reached a maximum content of 57.3% in CS50%-PE50%, while the ester reached a maximum value in PE25%-CS75%. The increased PE content produced a large number of hydrogen radicals that accelerated the hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions of phenols and furans.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed infrared pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) and corn stover, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent oil yields, and detailed product composition analysis via GC–MS."
"Catalytic recycling of the mixture of polypropylene and polystyrene Catalytic degradation of the mixture of polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) was investigated in a semi-batch reactor. For all the catalysts (HNZ, SA, HZSM-5) tested, the main degradation products were liquid oils with gasoline range carbon number distributions. A natural clinoptilolite zeolite (HNZ) showed as good catalytic performance as silica-alumina (SA). HZSM-5 catalyst produced the highest amount of gaseous products. Increase of degradation temperature resulted in a decrease of ethylbenzene and propylbenzene, but an increase of styrene. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed the interaction of PP and PS in the catalytic degradation.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics PP and PS in a lab-scale reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Depolymerization-liquefaction of plastics and rubbers. 2. Polystyrenes and styrene-butadiene copolymers The depolymerization-liquefaction reactions of representative polystyrene and styrene-butadiene co-polymer (non-vulcanized SBR) samples were systematically investigated as a function of processing variables, i.e. temperature (350–450°C), time (15–120 min), H2 pressure (500–2500 psig), and the presence of catalysts. Two solid superacids, i.e. Fe2O3 SO4 2− and ZrO2 SO4 2− , which differ in acidity were used in the study. The detailed composition of products was determined by GC/MS. Typical products from a polystyrene sample (average MW, 280 000) contained benzene, toluene, (C2C5) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, 1,3-diphenylalkanes and triphenylalkanes, accompanied by some indanes, tetralins, naphthalenes and polyphenyls, whereas products from non-vulcanized SBR (MW, 140 000) contained, in addition to the above, C5C9 paraffins and cycloparaffins, (C5C8) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, cyclopentylbenzenes, and cyclohexylbenzenes. The changes in product composition as a function of the above processing variables were determined and conditions for preferential (> 85 wt.%) production of gasoline-range liquid fuels established. The observed change in composition as a function of reaction time and temperature allowed for elucidation of mechanistic aspects of high-temperature depolymerization-liquefaction processes, including the role of catalytic effects.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymer with measurable product yields, composition analysis via GC/MS, and defined reactor conditions including temperature, time, H2 pressure, and catalysts."
"Leveraging carbon dioxide to control the H2/CO ratio in catalytic pyrolysis of fishing net waste The global presence of plastic debris has become an indisputable environmental issue. While it is useful to recycle used plastic materials, contaminated plastics require a series of pretreatments prior to the process. Here, we offer a viable thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) platform to directly valorize fishing net waste (FNW). Prior to the pyrolysis of FNW that was collected at a Korean seaport, its chemical composition (polyethylene) was examined using thermogravimetric analysis, ultimate analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Pyrolysis of FNW was conducted to produce value-added syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) in both CO2 and N2 environments with a variety of pyrolysis setups. The pyrolysis temperature significantly contributed to the thermal cracking of long-chain liquid HCs into H2 and C1-2 HCs under the N2 and CO2 conditions. In the presence of cobalt-based catalysts, an additional improvement of the reaction kinetics for producing H2 and C1-2 HCs was shown in the N2 environment. However, the synergistic effectiveness of Co-based catalysts and CO2 resulted in CO formation, because CO2 provided additional C and O sources over the Co-based catalysts. Thus, it allowed control of the H2/CO ratio in the CO2 and N2 atmospheres. The compositional matrix of the liquid HCs after pyrolysis also confirmed that CO2 controlled their aromaticity. Thus, the CO2-cofeeding pyrolysis of FNW can be considered a viable platform for the direct treatment of plastic wastes by harvesting energy as a form of syngas.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of fishing net waste (a waste plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and compositional analysis of syngas and hydrocarbons under varying conditions."
"Coke deposition and product distribution in the co-cracking of waste polyolefin derived streams and vacuum gas oil under FCC unit conditions The effect of co-cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or its pyrolysis wax together with vacuum gasoil (VGO) has been studied. The aim is to determine the content, nature, and location of coke while analyzing the impact on product distribution in the process. Four different feeds were used (VGO, VGO + 5 wt% HDPE, VGO + 20 wt% of wax, and 100 wt% wax) in experiments performed in a laboratory-scaled riser simulator, with similar conditions to those of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit: equilibrium catalyst; 530 °C; catalyst/feed mass ratio, 5; contact time, 6 s. The results of the different characterization techniques of the deactivated catalyst and the coke indicate that the catalyst fouling decreases notably by incorporating these waste streams, changing its nature to a more aliphatic (olefinic) one and its location towards the zeolite micropores. On the contrary, the coke formed from the VGO is more evolved and mainly constituted by polyaromatic components deposited on the mesopores of the catalyst matrix. Product distribution is also affected, increasing the yield of light cycle oil and keeping a relatively similar gasoline yield, with greater olefinity and lower aromaticity. Thus, the FCC shows great perspectives to valorize polyolefins, present in waste plastics, at great scale.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (HDPE) and their pyrolysis wax, with measurable product distribution, coke deposition analysis, and catalyst characterization under defined reactor conditions."
"Co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyvinyl chloride under microwave irradiation: Distribution of chlorine Co-pyrolysis of sophora wood (SW) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was conducted in a microwave reactor at different temperatures and different mixing ratios, and the transformation and distribution of chlorine in pyrolysis products were investigated. Microwave pyrolysis is a simple and efficient technique with better heating uniformity and process controllability than conventional heating. Compared with PVC pyrolysis, the addition of SW significantly reduced CO2 yield and greatly increased the yield of CO. The yield and quality of pyrolysis oil were effectively improved by SW, and the content of chlorine-containing compounds in the oil was suppressed to <1% at low temperatures (<550 °C). Co-pyrolysis of SW and PVC reduced the chlorine emissions from 59.07% to 28.09% and promoted the retention of chlorine in char (from 0.33% to 4.72%). Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were co-pyrolyzed with PVC to investigate their effects on chlorine distribution. The experiments demonstrated that lignin had the most significant effects on reducing gas phase chlorine emission and achieving chlorine immobilization, and chlorine mainly existed in the form of sodium chloride in the char of lignin-PVC co-pyrolysis. Hence co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and PVC provides a practical pathway for utilization of PVC waste in an environmentally friendly manner, realizing efficient chlorine retention and significantly reducing chlorine-related emissions.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a waste plastic, with biomass, demonstrating measurable product yields, chlorine distribution, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Effect of desilication of HZSM-5 on the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene Desilicated HZSM-5 (DeHZSM-5) was prepared by the desilication of HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3: 30) and applied to the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). TGA showed that HZSM-5 lowered the decomposition temperature and apparent activation energies of PS. DeHZSM-5 led a lower decomposition temperature and Ea values than HZSM-5. The main pyrolyzates of PS, styrene monomer, dimer, and trimer, were converted to smaller aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene and toluene. The increased pore size and acidity of DeHZSM-5 formed by the desilication of HZSM-5 led to the efficient diffusion of large molecular pyrolyzates with the increased formation of smaller molecular aromatic hydrocarbons confirming the higher catalytic cracking efficiency.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (a commercial plastic) using TGA and Py-GC/MS, with measurable results on decomposition temperatures, activation energies, and product composition."
"Enhancing pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue through torrefaction: Interactions among typical components Enhancing the pyrolysis of Automotive Shredder Residue (ASR) through torrefaction effectively removes impurities, preventing equipment corrosion and improving product quality. ASR, mainly composed of plastics, rubber, foam, and fabric in varying ratios, exhibits torrefaction and pyrolysis behaviours influenced by complex interactions among these components, which contribute to process outcomes that exceed the additive effects of individual components. To further elucidate the interaction mechanisms during the integrated torrefaction and pyrolysis process of ASR, this study analyzed the product properties of ASR with varying component ratios during this process. Our findings reveal that the interactions among the typical components of ASR enhance reactions between volatiles and char, boosting the polymerization of volatiles into char. This interaction increased char yield by over 6.0 wt% compared to the sum of individual components and enhanced the formation of large aromatic structures within the char. The melting of plastics over semi-char caused continuous volatile accumulation, further boosting polymerization, while foam’s porous structure enhanced volatile-char contact, promoting this process. Conversely, rubber and fabric produced more char and oxygen-containing radicals, promoting the secondary polymerization of volatiles. This resulted in char with higher molecular weight and a 50% increase in heteroatom content within the oil fraction.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue, a waste plastic mixture, with measurable product yields, char and oil composition analysis, and reactor condition effects reported."
"Pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a fluidized-bed reactor to obtain styrene monomer and gasoline fraction A specially designed laboratory fluidized-bed reactor apparatus was developed for the pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) waste in the range 450–700°C with nitrogen as the carrier gas and 20–40 mesh quartz sand as the fluidization medium, operating isothermally at atmospheric pressure. The yield of styrene monomer reached a maximum of 78.7 wt.% at a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C. Some monoaromatics with boiling point lower than 200°C could also be obtained as high-octane gasoline fraction. Styrene monomer with 99.6 wt.% purity was obtained after vacuum distillation of the liquid products, which could be used as the raw material to produce high-quality PS. The attempt to increase the yields of styrene monomer and other monoaromatics by recycling the higher boiling point fraction to the reactor during pyrolysis is also discussed.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Valorizing plastic toy wastes to flammable gases through CO2-mediated pyrolysis with a Co-based catalyst Toys are discarded due to their short life cycle. Unfortunately, development of sustainable disposal platform for toy has not gained particular concern. To establish a reliable disposal platform, this study employed a pyrolysis platform to valorize plastics into value-added fuels. To confer more environmentally resilient process, CO2 was used as a feedstock to enhance the process efficiency from a perspective of the yield of flammable gases. To this end, waste toy brick (WTB) was used as a model compound. The exact types of plastics (polyacrylonitrile, polybutadiene, polystyrene, and polymethyl methacrylate) in WTB were experimentally determined. In pyrolysis of WTB, the complicated mixture of benzene derivatives was inevitably generated. To detoxify them by means of syngas (H2/CO) production, catalytic pyrolysis was performed. Co catalyst effectively induced chemical bond scissions, leading to substantially enhanced H2 formation. Also, the gas phase reactions (GPRs) between CO2 and volatile compounds over Co catalyst expedited the production rate of CO, and such CO enhancement effectively offered a chance to mitigate toxic chemical generations. The synergistic contribution of CO2 and Co catalyst enhanced syngas formation more than 25 times in reference to pyrolysis of WTB without Co catalyst. The GPRs also greatly prevented catalyst deactivation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic toy bricks (containing polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, etc.) with measurable syngas yields and catalyst performance data."
"Sustainable conversion of waste plastic into reduced graphene oxide for superior supercapacitor applications: A comparative electrolyte study The present study investigates the upcycling of waste polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a nanoclay-assisted melt mixing and pyrolysis process. A comparative electrochemical evaluation is performed using sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and potassium chloride (KCl), electrolytes in a three-electrode configuration.

The fabricated device executes a maximum energy density of 53.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 280 W/kg. Additionally, this device shows remarkable long-term cycling stability, retaining approximately 83.1 % of its initial capacitance after 12,000 charge-discharge cycles. These findings demonstrate an efficient route for converting plastic waste into high-performance supercapacitor materials.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to produce reduced graphene oxide, with measurable product performance (specific capacitance, energy density, cycling stability) and experimental conditions (nanoclay catalyst, melt mixing, pyrolysis process)."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of polycarbonate and polyethylene/polypropylene mixtures: Promotion of oil deoxygenation and aromatic hydrocarbon formation The co-pyrolysis of polycarbonate (PC) and polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) in the presence of HZSM-5 catalyst was studied in a two-stage tube reactor with the objective of promoting simultaneous deoxygenation and aromatic hydrocarbon formation, at atmospheric pressure and without external hydrogen addition. As the blending ratio of PE/PP increased, the yield of oil phase product, coke, and solid decreased, and the yield of gas phase increased significantly. At the blending ratio of 75% PP, the concentration of oxygenates in the oil was reduced to 2.9% and that of aromatic hydrocarbons increased to 97.1%. Increasing the reaction temperature from 500 °C to 700 °C increased the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons further to 98.1%. Catalyst regeneration decreased the acidity of the HZSM-5 catalyst, resulting in a slight decrease in the deoxygenation and aromatization effects. The results showed that PP is an effective hydrogen donor in the catalytic deoxygenation and aromatization process; the hydrogen provided enhanced the adsorption of phenols produced by the pyrolysis of PC on HZSM-5 and their direct deoxygenation to form new aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PC, PE, PP) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Identify the impact of pyrolysis temperature on preparation of carbon nanotubes by catalytic reforming polypropylene Catalytic reforming offers a promising method for converting waste plastics into valuable products such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The composition of the carbon source plays a crucial role in determining the growth of CNTs because pyrolysis temperature exerts a significant influence on volatilisation. This study investigated the impact of pyrolysis temperature on the formation of CNTs in the presence of an Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. A pyrolysis temperature of 500 ℃, generated a liquid product containing a high concentration of long-chain waxy hydrocarbons, while the gaseous products were dominated by C3H6 (47 vol%) and C2H6 (20 vol%). Increasing the pyrolysis temperature facilitated the formation of CH4 and aromatic hydrocarbons at the expense of the waxy components. Following catalysis, carbon deposits of > 30 wt% (comprising approximately 80 % CNTs) were obtained at 500 ℃, compared to 20 wt% (with CNTs comprising 60 %) at 900 ℃. In summary, the results suggest that small molecular hydrocarbons, including C3H6 and waxy components, promote CNT formation, whereas aromatic hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of amorphous carbon or coke.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene waste plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of carbon nanotubes and byproducts."
"Characterization and performance evaluation of co-pyrolysis oil from waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene as a potential diesel substitute In this experimental study, the co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene in different proportions was conducted at 500 °C using a fixed bed type reactor, and synthesized oils were tested to determine their physical and chemical properties, aiming to evaluate their potential as alternative fuel sources. Promising properties closely resembling those of transportation-grade diesel, such as low density (759.1–848.9 kg/m3), higher calorific value (42.33–46.22 MJ/kg), low oxygen content (1.02 %), and zero sulphur content, were observed in the obtained oils. To assess the performance, combustion, and emissions of the co-pyrolysis oil blended with diesel, three different blends (D90P10, D80P20, D70P30) were analyzed at various engine loads. The results revealed that the brake thermal efficiency of the engine increased from 26.2 % to 27.4 % for the D90P10 blend under high load conditions. At top load conditions, the blend D90P10 exhibits a maximum reduction in HC, smoke, and CO emissions by 19.3 %, 17.3 %, and 5.6 %, while NO have increased by 42.85 %. However, as the proportion of the co-pyrolysis oil in the blend increased, the NO emissions decreased. Hence, co-pyrolysis oil blending upto 30 % can be considered a potential alternative to reduce diesel consumption.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and waste cooking oil, with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and engine performance data."
"ZSM-5 zeolites performance assessment in catalytic pyrolysis of PVC-containing real WEEE plastic wastes Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes is a promising way for their conversion into valuable products. By modulating the catalyst properties and operating conditions, it is possible to direct the product distribution to obtain oils that may be suitable both as fuels and as chemicals. However, the efficient and safe removal of the halogens, often contained in plastic wastes, remains as a great challenge. In this work, the catalytic behaviour of ZSM-5 zeolites in the pyrolysis of a real chlorinated plastic waste of the electric and electronic equipment sector (WEEE), consisting of PE with about 3.4% of PVC, was investigated. To that end, three zeolite samples with different acidity and accessibility were synthesized and assayed. A thermal pre-treatment was applied to the plastic waste at 350 ºC, which allowed a chlorine removal of 87% from the WEEE feedstock. The pyrolysis tests were carried out in a downdraft fixed-bed stainless steel reactor, with a catalyst/feedstock ratio of 0.2, at temperatures of 600 ºC and 450 ºC in the thermal and catalytic zones, respectively, of the reaction system. In comparison with thermal pyrolysis, that mainly produced waxes, the product distribution changed considerably by contacting the pyrolysis vapours with ZSM-5 zeolites, leading to a strong enhancement in the yield of oil and gases. The largest yield of oil (about 60 wt%), having a concentration of monoaromatics (mainly BTX) above 50 wt%, was attained over the desilicated ZSM-5 sample. Regarding chlorine distribution, about 90% was accumulated in the char fraction, probably captured by the inorganic components present in the raw WEEE waste. Coke was the second fraction in terms of Cl concentration, followed by wax and oil, whereas this halogen was almost not detected in the gases. The lowest concentration of Cl in the oil was attained with the desilicated zeolite, with a value below 90 ppm, which could facilitate the subsequent processing of this stream in refinery units.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of real PVC-containing plastic waste (WEEE) in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product composition, and catalyst performance data."
"Study of synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics from the perspective of phase reactions Co-pyrolysis is an important direction for the high-value conversion and utilization of biomass and plastics. Research on the mechanisms underlying synergistic effects contributes to the regulation of co-pyrolysis processes and enables targeted production of products. The synergistic effect is primarily determined by the physicochemical properties of the feedstocks as well as chemical reactions occurring during pyrolysis. This study designed co-pyrolysis experiments with varying mass transfer processes, aiming to classify and identify physical and chemical changes in co-pyrolysis from a reactive perspective, thereby obtaining methods for regulating the co-pyrolysis process. The research findings indicate that solid-phase contact and reactions between gas phase and solid phase are major factors influencing pyrolytic behavior and variations in pyrolytic products, independent of feedstock types. The type of feedstock affects specific reaction processes. In terms of thermal weight loss, both PP and PET can facilitate the pyrolysis of cellulose, but the molten PET, due to its higher viscosity, can encapsulate cellulose, preventing the release of volatile components and promoting secondary reactions. Regarding surface structure characteristics of biochar, the main difference between the two plastics lies in the hydroxyl group content. PETV can reduce the hydroxyl group content on the biochar surface through esterification reaction, while also fixing itself on the biochar surface, thereby increasing the biochar yield. PPV primarily reacts with unsaturated structures such as carbonyl groups, increasing the hydroxyl group content. As for the liquid phase products, both plastics can promote the deep decomposition of CE, producing more small molecular substances. This synergistic effect primarily originates from the interaction between plastic volatiles and CE.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PET) with biomass, includes experimental reactor conditions, product yields, and analytical characterization of biochar and liquid products."
"Insight into the kinetics and thermodynamic analyses of thermally-induced phase separation and liquid fuel recovery from Co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and polyethylene The study investigated the kinetic, thermal, and thermodynamic behaviors of the co-pyrolysis of waste cooking oil and waste polyethylene. The results showed an evident two-phase degradation of the different WCO-WP mixtures. WCO showed complete degradation in Phase 1(300–435 °C), whereas W3P1 showed a maximum degradation of 60.19 wt% among the mixtures at the same phase. The maximum weight loss temperatures for all the WCO-WP mixtures in Phase 2(435–510 °C) were found to be lower than that of WP. The correlation coefficient for diffusion models was 0.95–0.98, suggesting it to be the most probable reaction mechanism for WCO- WP co-pyrolysis. The activation energies of the mixtures for diffusion models were found to range from 103.33 to 122.66 kJ/mol and 73.42–258.88 kJ/mol in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. The recorded entropy values for the co-pyrolysis of mixtures were lower than the parent pyrolysis value, indicating a stable activated complex formation during co-pyrolysis. Moreover, the highest liquid yield of 67.2 wt% was obtained for the W1P1 proportion at 500 °C. The produced liquid oil has a calorific value in the range of 42.8 to 45.9 MJ/kg. The GC–MS analysis of the highest-yield liquid at various temperatures reveals that its primary compounds are alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols, highlighting its potential as an alternative fuel source. The highest alkane percentage of 31.85 % was recorded at 500 °C. Additionally, the obtained liquid oil contains 71.05 % to 80.33 % of C8–C16 hydrocarbons, which fall within the typical carbon chain range for jet fuels.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyethylene and waste cooking oil, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of the liquid oil."
"Investigation on the synergistic effect between different components in pyrolysis of paper-plastic composite material Pyrolysis characteristics of Tetra Pak, a paperboard-polyethylene-aluminium foil, were investigated in this study with a focus on the synergistic effect between its individual components. Scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that molten LDPE coating on cellulose surface led to suppression on mass and heat transfer and the increased activation energy of pyrolysis reaction. Samples of individual components and simulated Tetra Pak packaging were pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyzer at various heating rates. Synergistic effect between cellulose and LDPE on E a and the formation of characteristic products are investigated: Kinetic analysis showed that the cellulose decomposition peak in the simulated mixture exhibited a higher E a than that of pure cellulose at each conversion rate. For LDPE, the free radicals formed from cellulose pyrolysis enhanced the degradation of plastic polymers, resulting that E a of its decomposition peak in the mixture being lower in comparison to pure LDPE, with a discrepancy of around 16–27 kJ·mol−1. The formation of characteristic products including levoglucosan, furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and alkanes from pyrolysis of cellulose and LDPE mixture with different mass ratios was further investigated in a micro-pyrolyzer. The results suggested that synergistic effects and physical barrier existed during fast pyrolysis between cellulose and LDPE. The extent of the synergy effect depended on the proportion of cellulose and LDPE in the mixture.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) in a composite material, with experimental data on kinetic parameters, product formation, and synergistic effects under controlled reactor conditions."
"Catalytic cracking of HDPE over hybrid zeolitic–mesoporous materials The potential application of hybrid ZSM-5/MCM-41 materials for the catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated and compared with the behavior of standard Al-MCM-41 and HZSM-5 samples. Hybrid zeolitic–mesoporous materials were prepared from zeolite seeds obtained in different stages of ZSM-5 crystallization by variation of the synthesis time. The seeds were assembled around cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles to obtain hybrid materials having a combination of both zeolitic and mesostructured features. The samples so obtained have exhibited remarkable catalytic activity in the HDPE cracking despite the low temperatures (380°C) and catalyst loadings used (plastic/catalyst mass ratio=100), leading to polyolefin conversions higher than both Al-MCM-41 and HZSM-5. The product distribution observed with the hybrid materials are closer to that obtained in the HDPE cracking over HZSM-5 zeolite, with a high proportion of light hydrocarbons. Moreover, the products present a high content of C3–C5 olefins, which is an interesting result regarding its possible use as raw chemicals. Increasing the zeolitic crystallinity of the hybrid materials causes an enhancement in the production of heavier products with boiling points within the gasoline range and a higher content of aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study investigates catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, a waste plastic, using lab-scale experiments with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
Pyro-GC/MS and thermal degradation studies in polystyrene–poly(vinyl chloride) blends The blends of polystyrene (PS) using various proportions of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were prepared and the thermal decomposition temperatures of these blends were measured from the dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) carried out under inert atmosphere from ambient to 800°C at different heating rates. Kinetic parameters of the degradation process in pure PS and its blends with various proportions of PVC were calculated. Activation energy of the degradation process in the blends was found to increase with the inclusion of small amount of PVC in PS. The stabilization effect on PS varies with the heating rates and the composition of the blends. The pyrolysis gas-chromatographic mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) studies were also carried out over a range of temperature (330–370°C) and the intensity of major ions produced during pyrolysis were separated and measured though GC/MS. Using a small amount of PVC in the matrix showed a marked reduction in the major pyrolysis products of PS. The stabilization of PS in the blends has been explained by a mechanism involving interaction between the degrading products from the polymer components leading to a stable polymer network. The extent of interaction is affected by the changing morphology of the blends with composition.,"The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic blends (PS and PVC) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization via Py-GC/MS and TGA."
"Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of rice straw pellets and plastic packaging wastes for value-added products and energy recovery The sustainable utilization of agricultural residues and waste plastics to mitigate environmental pollution, while generating renewable energy through pyrolysis has achieved significant attention through the years. In this study, microwave-assisted pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of plastic packaging wastes (PPW) and rice straw pellets (RSP) of different mixture compositions (10 % PPW, 20 % PPW, and 30 % PPW) have been carried out to evaluate the synergistic effect of the two different feedstocks on product yields, composition, energy recovery, energy and exergy efficiency. With an intention to avoid pulverization of the feedstocks to fine particle sizes, a unique configuration resembling a chocolate is adopted to mix the biomass pellet with sheets of PPW, while using activated carbon as a susceptor. The calorific value of the co-pyrolysis oil was higher (30–35 MJ kg−1) than the pyrolysis oil obtained from RSP (22–28 MJ kg−1). The maximum oil yield from co-pyrolysis was 40 wt% for a feed-to-susceptor ratio of 2.5:1 w/w, 10 % PPW at 600 °C, and 800 W microwave power. Compared to the pyrolysis of RSP, co-pyrolysis resulted in significant deoxygenation in the oil fraction (50–60 %). The oil composition data revealed an increase in aliphatic hydrocarbons from 37 % to 42 % along with increased aromatics from 13 % to 19 % when PPW content was increased from 10 % to 30 % in the feedstock. High energy recovery (∼91 %) and feed conversion efficiency (∼99 %) were recorded for 20 % PPW at 800 W and 600 °C. The net energy balance for co-pyrolysis was positive (9–16 MJ kg−1) at different reaction conditions, which proves the energetic feasibility of the process. At 800 W and 600 °C, the total exergy efficiency was maximum (57.7 %) for 10 % PPW feedstock, and the exergy efficiencies were lower than the energy efficiency values.","The study involves microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of plastic packaging waste (PPW) and rice straw pellets, with measurable product yields, oil composition analysis, and energy efficiency data obtained under defined reactor conditions."
"Fuel production by cracking of polyolefins pyrolysis waxes under fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) operating conditions The catalytic cracking of high–density polyethylene pyrolysis waxes under fluidized catalytic cracking conditions has been investigated with the aim of producing fuels at large–scale from waxes obtained in pyrolysis plants located nearby collection and segregation points. Additionally, preliminary information about the capacity of these units to valorize waste polyolefins has been obtained. The catalytic cracking runs have been performed in a riser simulator reactor under industrial conditions: 500–560 °C; catalyst to oil mass ratio, 3, 5 and 7 gcat goil −1; and, contact time, 6 s. The product distribution has been quantified determining the yields of different fractions, which have been defined according to their boiling point range: dry gas, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The concentration of the families of compounds has been also determined, which are n–paraffins, iso–paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics. For the shake of comparison, the results of catalytic cracking of a common stream fed to the industrial units, i.e., vacuum gasoil, have been included. Globally, promising results have been obtained in the valorization of waste polyolefins by means of this combination of pyrolysis–cracking stages that expose, at the same time, the capacity of this unit to manage waste plastics.",The study involves pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (a commercial plastic) followed by catalytic cracking under lab-scale reactor conditions with measurable product yields and composition analysis.
"The effect of slow pyrolysis on the conversion of packaging waste plastics (PE and PP) into fuel Packaging plastic waste consisting of low and high-density polyethylene and polypropylene were pyrolyzed in a lab scale semi-batch reactor at a very slow dynamic condition (1 °C min−1). Gaseous and liquid products were collected at regular intervals starting from their inception during the degradation process. Detailed analysis was carried out to estimate the properties of plastic derive oil (PDO) obtained at different stages of the pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis temperature has a significant effect on the product compositions. The paraffin concentration increases with increasing pyrolysis temperatures. On the other hand, increased pyrolysis temperature decreases olefin concentration. Olefinic content in the PDO was found comparatively higher when PP was in the feed. Presence of polypropylene in the feed caused the production of PDOs with branch-chain hydrocarbon components with high isoparaffin index and research octane number (RON). The PDOs obtained (for all feed studied) at the early stages of the degradation process have light hydrocarbon liquid fractions belonging to light and middle distillates of petroleum (C6 – C20). The yield of both light and middle fractions decreased as the pyrolysis reactor temperature reached the maximum value (∼400 °C). Gas evolution pattern depends on both pyrolysis temperature and the feed composition. Propylene was found more dominating among other major components of gases like methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, n-butane, 1-butene, isobutylene and n-pentane etc.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE and PP) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Quantitative analysis of microplastics in beach sand via low-temperature solvent extraction and thermal degradation: Effects of particle size and sample depth Quantifying trace levels of microplastics in complex environmental media remains a challenge. In this study, an approach combining field collection of samples from different depths, sample size fractionation, and plastic quantification via pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) was employed to identify and quantify microplastics at two public beaches along the northeast coast of the U.S. (Salisbury beach, MA and Hampton beach, NH). A simple sampling tool was used to collect beach sand from depth intervals of 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm, respectively. The samples were sieved to give three size fractions: coarse (>1.2 mm), intermediate (100 μ m–1.2 mm), and fine (1.2 μ m–100 μ m) particles. Following density separation and wet peroxide oxidation, a low-temperature solvent extraction protocol involving 2-chlorophenol was used to extract polyester (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyamide (PA), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The extract was analyzed using Py-GC–MS for the respective polymers, while the solid residue was pyrolyzed separately for polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). The one-step solvent extraction method significantly simplified the sample matrix and improved the sensitivity of analysis. Among the samples, PET was detected in greater quantities in the fine fraction than in the intermediate size fraction, and PET fine particles were located predominantly in the surface sand. Similar to PET, PS was detected at higher mass concentrations in the fine particles in most samples. These results underscore the importance of beach environment for plastic fragmentation, where a combination of factors including UV irradiation, mechanical abrasion, and water exposure promote plastic breakdown. Surface accumulation of fine plastic particles may also be attributed to transport of microplastics through wind and tides. The proposed sample treatment and analysis methods may allow sensitive and quantitative measurements of size or depth-related distribution patterns of microplastics in complex environmental media.","The study involves laboratory-scale pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) from beach sand samples, with measurable product analysis via Py-GC–MS and quantifiable yields based on size and depth fractions."
"Catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene over zeolite-containing hierarchical two-layered catalyst with different mesopore size using Curie point pyrolyzer Zeolite-containing hierarchical two-layered (ZC2L) catalysts were prepared by the gel skeletal reinforcement method. Their reactivity was estimated in catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 590°C using a Curie point pyrolyzer method. In addition, the “relative activity” per amount of zeolite in the catalyst was calculated, and the relationship between the pore and acid properties of each catalyst was investigated. The results suggested that the presence of both mesopores and the strong acid sites of zeolite would be closely related to the increase in activity. ZSM-5-ZC2L catalysts showed much higher aromatics selectivity especially for toluene and p-xylene than ZSM-5 single and kaolin-mixed catalysts. In contrast to the cases of ZSM-5-containing catalysts, β-zeolite-containing catalysts and Y-zeolite-containing catalysts selectively produced i-olefins and i-paraffins, respectively. The product selectivity of the ZC2L catalyst was influenced by the size of the micropores of the zeolite while the hierarchical ZC2L catalysts with a small amount (26 wt%) of zeolite exhibited the higher activity than zeolite single catalysts.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, using lab-scale experiments with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Bio-oil production via catalytic microwave co-pyrolysis of lignin and low density polyethylene using zinc modified lignin-based char as a catalyst In order to improve the product quality and make the process more sustainable, lignin-based char was used as a catalyst during microwave co-pyrolysis of lignin and low density polyethylene (LDPE). Lignin-based char modification using zinc transition metal proved to be beneficial by improving the porosity and selectiveness of the prepared catalyst. General selectivity of lignin-based char catalyst was observed to produce bio-oil with high selectivity of valued compounds. GC/MS analysis proved that the major chemical components of the bio-oil were hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, phenols and guaiacols(∼70%). A central composite experimental design (CCD) was used to optimize the product yield and component composition. The optimum condition to produce the highest quantity and quality of bio-oil was 450 °C and 12.5% LDPE/lignin ratio. GC analysis of the syn-gas revealed that the valued compounds were H2, CO and CH4, the content of which was about 40%, 20% and 5%, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic microwave co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) and lignin, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis via GC–MS and GC."
"Conversion of pyrolysis vapors derived from non-biodegradable waste plastics (PET) into valuable fuels using nickel-impregnated HZSM5-70 catalysts Recycling waste plastics into pyrolytic fuels is a highly promising energy-saving approach. The improvement and enhancement of the resulting fuel quality from heavy oil-derived-waste plastics pyrolysis is in high demand. We performed catalytic reforming of heavy oils-derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET) pyrolysis to simultaneously improve the quality of oils into valuable fuels (gasoline-range hydrocarbon) and reduce the oxygenated compounds. Nickel-impregnated HZSM5-70 catalysts were prepared by the wet-impregnation method. The catalytic process was carried out in a catalytic tubular reactor at a constant feeding rate of 2.5 mL/h. In particular, various processing factors were examined by varying the impregnation loading of nickel (2–10 wt%), catalyst mass (1–5 wt%), and process temperature (400–500 °C). Increasing any of the three process parameters resulted in a relatively similar decrease in the quantity of liquid products and an improvement in the quality of reformed products. The best quality of reformed oils were obtained at 5 % catalyst loading and 10 % nickel loading on the catalyst at 450 °C. FT-IR analyses show that raising process parameters has a substantial influence on increasing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon content, while lowering the quantity of undesired products (acids, alcohols, and ketones) in the oils. GC–MS analysis results confirmed that the relative content/area of liquid products predominantly contains gasoline-range hydrocarbons (C5-C12), with a total of 33.39 % on blank-run. The hydrocarbons (C5-C12) production from HZSM5-70 and NiO/HZSM5-70 was greatly enhanced to 66.48 % and 85.05 %, repectively, while the oxygenated compounds, including alcohols, acids, and ketones were reduced from 39.38 to 10.75 % (total area). In comparison to HZSM5-70, the NiO/HZSM5-70 catalyst performs more effectively, retaining its catalytic activity after five cycles (∼3 % decrease). Thus, the NiO/HZSM5-70 exhibits high catalytic performance and reusability.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste PET plastic in a lab-scale tubular reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of fuel composition."
"Synthesis of carbon nanotubes by sequential pyrolysis and combustion of polyethylene Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized from polyethylene using a pyrolysis–combustion technique. Pre- or post-consumer polyethylene (in strips, pellets or ground particles) was pyrolyzed to gaseous products, which were then combined with an oxygen-containing gas and auto-ignited to create a fuel-rich flame. The combustion effluent was used to synthesize multi-wall CNTs using stainless-steel wire mesh as both catalyst and substrate. An overall CNT yield in the order of 10%, by mass relative to the initial carbon in the fuel, was typically achieved before purification. The viability of partial conversion of a readily-available waste stream to the value-added product of CNTs was demonstrated, combining the economy and process safety aspects of flame synthesis with the control of synthesis temperature that chemical vapor deposition methods typically afford.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyethylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable CNT yield and experimental characterization of the process."
"Transformation behavior and fate of chlorine in polychloroprene (PCP) during its pyrolysis Polychloroprene (PCP) rubber is mostly mixed in industrial solid waste (ISW) as the main source of chlorine element. Whereas, the products formation and chlorine behavior during the pyrolysis are insufficiently illustrated for this typical chlorinated polymer, which is not conducive to the chlorine regulation of ISW pyrolytic products. In order to investigate the chlorine transformation behavior, the PCP pyrolysis under the influence of a wide range of heating rates (3–600 °C/min) was conducted to explore the chlorine distribution properties as well as its migration mechanism in the present study. Importantly, 30–65 wt% chlorine was found to be migrated to gas and tar, respectively. Compared with PVC, the differences of chlorine distribution between PCP and PVC may be attributed to the easier cyclization with a longer molecular chain. Also, the release temperature of HCl acted as main component determines its availability for the subsequent formation of chlorinated hydrocarbons. In details, the conversion pathway from chlorinated limonene to Cl-aromatic hydrocarbons was confirmed and the reaction was found to be enhanced at higher temperature and heating rate. By analyzing the content of tar components (especially at low heating rate), it was found that the major formation pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons was supposed to be the direct Diels-Alder reaction of monomer rather than the dechlorination of intermediate chlorinated limonene. Our findings discussed the effect mechanism of heating rate and temperature on chlorine behavior during PCP pyrolysis, providing guidance for the chlorine regulation of ISW pyrolytic products.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polychloroprene, a chlorinated plastic waste, under varying heating rates, with measured chlorine distribution and product formation, including gas, tar, and aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"The pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride: Kinetic study and product evolution This study investigates the thermal decomposition kinetics and mechanisms of Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Kinetic parameters were determined using model-free methods, including Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), as well as the model-fitting Coats-Redfern (CR) method. PVC was dehydrochlorinated in a fixed-bed reactor at 300–450 °C, followed by pyrolysis at 550 °C using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS). In fixed-bed experiments, gaseous products and chlorine-containing species were characterized using a gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors (GC-TCD/FID), and oxygen bomb combustion-ion chromatography (OBC-IC). The structural evolution of char was examined through elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The raw PVC was also pyrolyzed with Py-GC/MS at 300–550 °C to elucidate the reaction mechanism. Results revealed a two-stage thermal decomposition pathway for PVC, with the activation energy for the first stage (131.477 kJ·mol−1) was notably lower than that of the second stage (199.409 kJ·mol−1), indicating that defect structures initiate dehydrochlorination. At lower temperatures during fast pyrolysis, raw PVC undergoes dehydrochlorination, releasing HCl and forming short-chain conjugated polyenes. As temperature increases, the dehydrochlorination rate accelerates, forming longer conjugated polyene chains that rapidly cyclize and aromatize into bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, the two-stage process, comprising low-temperature dehydrochlorination in a fixed-bed reactor followed by pyrolysis via PY-GC/MS, facilitates the development of a more extensively crosslinked structure during the initial stage. Upon subsequent thermal treatment, the crosslinked network undergoes further cracking and structural rearrangement, forming aliphatic hydrocarbons and more polycyclic aromatic compounds, particularly tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic PVC using fixed-bed and PY-GC/MS methods, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization of products and char."

The main gaseous and liquid products including the chlorinated hydrocarbons obtained at different temperatures were identified and quantified by chromatographic methods. Global mass balance and chlorine mass balance were determined and different techniques to capture HCl under vacuum conditions were tested. The solid residue was analyzed and characterized for elemental composition, surface properties and calorific value. The advantages of the vacuum pyrolysis process and the potential difficulties expected during large scale pyrolysis treatment of PVC are briefly discussed.","The study involves lab-scale vacuum pyrolysis of pure PVC, a waste plastic, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products and residue."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste using activated carbon from cotton waste This study introduces a novel approach to plastic waste management and energy recovery by synthesizing highly porous activated carbon from an often-overlooked resource, waste cotton fabric (WCF), using H3PO4 as an activating agent. The synthesized waste cotton fabric activated carbon samples (WCF-AC) were utilized as a solid acid catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), with the aim of converting LDPE into fuel-range hydrocarbons. This research highlights the potential of bio-based waste materials in the synthesis of eco-friendly and cost-effective catalysts for feedstock recycling. The impact of the H3PO4 impregnation ratio and the carbonization/activation temperature on the physicochemical properties of the resulting WCF-AC samples was investigated, providing valuable insights into the optimization of activated carbon production. The catalytic activity of the synthesized WCF-AC samples was evaluated, demonstrating a reduction of 12°C in the LDPE degradation temperature. Furthermore, this work revealed a substantial increase in the formation of carbocyclic compounds, with light aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and xylene constituting up to 43 % of the pyrolysis output. In certain instances, a decrease in heavier hydrocarbons beyond C11 was observed, indicating the selective yield of specific range hydrocarbons. This study underscores the potential of bio-based acid catalysts, such as the synthesized activated carbon presented here, in plastic recycling. The approach adopted in this research aligns with the principles of the circular economy, promoting resource efficiency and sustainability.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, using a synthesized activated carbon catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature effects, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of corn stalk and polyethylene at a gas phase contacting mode and aromatization mechanism study The co-pyrolysis of “hydrogen-deficient” biomass and plastics is an efficient method to produce aromatic-rich bio-oils. However, the distinct pyrolysis characteristics and complex interactions between biomass and plastics in conventional reactors limited aromatics production and synergy study. A modified Y-shaped tube reactor was therefore established, in which corn straw and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were placed in two branches respectively, with a co-pyrolysis ZSM-5 catalyst at the junction for co-pyrolysis. Firstly, optimal pyrolysis conditions (temperature, catalyst-to-feedstock ratio) were studied for each feedstock to boost furans/light olefins production. As a result, the Diels-Alder reaction raised the aromatics to 21.7 area% in non-catalytic trial. The addition of co-pyrolysis ZSM-5(60) further strengthened this reaction and doubled aromatics to 44.8 area%. It is noteworthy that even with the same catalyst (ZSM-5(60)), the gas-phase contact mode outperformed the conventional co-pyrolysis mode (39.4 area%) in aromatic generation. Subsequently, the synergy between HDPE and cellulose/hemicellulose/lignin was respectively investigated. Results showed that the Diels-Alder reaction between furans and light olefins contributed most to aromatics production, followed by the aromatization of HDPE-derived light olefins.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) and corn stalk (biomass) in a modified reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analysis of aromatic compound formation."
"A feasible approach for the treatment of waste computer casing plastic using subcritical to supercritical acetone: Statistical modelling and optimization Electronic waste (e-waste) usage has increased tremendously with the rapid evolution of technologies. The accumulated e-waste has now emerged as one of the crucial concerns regarding environmental pollution and human health. Recycling e-waste is commonly focused on metal recovery; nevertheless, a significant fraction of plastics (20–30%) are in e-waste. There is an indispensable need to focus on e-waste plastic recycling in an effective way, which has been mostly overlooked to date. An environmentally safe and efficient study is conducted using subcritical to supercritical acetone (SCA) to degrade the real waste computer casing plastics (WCCP) in the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM) to achieve the maximum oil yield of the product. The experiment parameters were varied in the temperature span of 150–300 °C, residence time between 30 and 120 min, solid/liquid ratio between 0.02 and 0.05 (g/ml), and NaOH amount from 0 to 0.5 g. Adding NaOH into the acetone helps to achieve efficient degradation and debromination efficiency. The study emphasized the attributes of oils and solid products recovered from the SCA-treated WCCP. The characterization of feed and formed products is performed with different characterization techniques such as TGA, CHNS, ICP-MS, FTIR, GC-MS, Bomb calorimeter, XRF, and FESEM. The highest oil yield achieved is 87.89% from the SCA process at 300 °C, in 120min, 0.05 S/L ratio, and 0.5 g of NaOH. GC-MS results disclose that the liquid product (oil) comprises single- and duplicate-ringed aromatic and oxygen-containing compounds. Isophorone is the significant component of the liquid product obtained. Furthermore, SCA's possible polymer degradation mechanistic route, bromine distribution, economic feasibility, and environmental aspect were also explored. This present work represents an environmentally friendly and promising approach for recycling the plastic fraction of e-waste and recovering valuable chemicals from WCCP.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste computer casing plastics using subcritical to supercritical acetone, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Production of low molecular oil from typical polyolefin plastics through molten salts thermal treatment The resource recovery based on pyrolysis has become the mainstream disposal method for polyolefin plastics in recent years. However, the poor heat transfer characteristics and uneven temperature distribution of plastics lead to inferior product quality. To address these problems, molten salts thermal treatment was performed to conduct targeted regulation of the process. It revealed that the excellent heat storage and thermal conductivity of molten salts provide a strengthened heat source for plastics, promoting product homogenization and high-value conversion. It reduced the energy barrier of the reaction and prompted the conversion of macromolecular components to light oil. Meanwhile, the catalysis of alkali metal salts effectively inhibited the transition cracking of major oil components. The yield of pyrolysis oil increased while the valuable products gradually accumulated, such as α-olefins (ranging from 26.48 % to 31.06 %) and styrene (ranging from 48.89 % to 64.03 %). Additionally, the kinetics of hydrogen could be used to analyze the dynamic processes of plastic pyrolysis well and the activation energy was significantly reduced with molten salts. The contracting volume model was considered to be the most suitable reaction model, providing critical insight for the thermal treatment of plastics at larger scales.","The study involves lab-scale molten salts thermal treatment of polyolefin plastics, demonstrating measurable product yields, catalytic effects, and detailed product composition analysis, including specific percentages of α-olefins and styrene."
"Vacuum pyrolysis of automobile shredder residues A research program was undertaken to evaluate the overall performance of a vacuum pyrolysis process applied to the treatment of Automobile Shredder Residues (ASR). North American and European ASR samples were tested. Vacuum pyrolysis experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 496–536°C and a total pressure of approx. 1–5 kPa. Pyrolysis product yields averaged 52.5 wt.% solid residue, 27.7 wt.% organic liquids, 13.3 wt.% pyrolytic water and 6.6 wt.% pyrolysis gas. Composition of ASR feedstocks and pyrolysis products has been thoroughly characterized. After pyrolysis, ASR volume and weight were reduced 5×and 1.8×, respectively. It was possible to readily recover 14 wt.% of useful metals remaining in the solid residues; the material left over can be safely landfilled. Pyrolytic gas and oil can be used as heating fuels. The heavy fraction of the oil (>400°C) can be added to road bitumens in order to improve their performance. The total oil also represents a challenging matrix for various purposes. The vacuum pyrolysis technology can be seen as an alternative to landfill and incineration.","The study involves lab-scale vacuum pyrolysis of automobile shredder residues, a waste plastic mixture, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Possibilities and limits of pyrolysis for recycling plastic rich waste streams rejected from phones recycling plants The possibilities and limits of pyrolysis as a means of recycling plastic rich fractions derived from discarded phones have been studied. Two plastic rich samples (⩾80wt% plastics) derived from landline and mobile phones provided by a Spanish recycling company, have been pyrolysed under N2 in a 3.5dm3 reactor at 500°C for 30min. The landline and mobile phones yielded 58 and 54.5wt% liquids, 16.7 and 12.6wt% gases and 28.3 and 32.4wt% solids respectively. The liquids were a complex mixture of organic products containing valuable chemicals (toluene, styrene, ethyl-benzene, etc.) and with high HHVs (34–38MJkg−1). The solids were composed of metals (mainly Cu, Zn, and Al) and char (≈50wt%). The gases consisted mainly of hydrocarbons and some CO, CO2 and H2. The halogens (Cl, Br) of the original samples were mainly distributed between the gases and solids. The metals and char can be easily separated and the formers may be recycled, but the uses of the char will be restricted due to its Cl/Br content. The gases may provide the energy requirements of the processing plant, but HBr and HCl must be firstly eliminated. The liquids could have a potential use as energy or chemicals source, but the practical implementation of these applications will be no exempt of great problems that may become insurmountable (difficulty of economically recovering pure chemicals, contamination by volatile metals, etc.)","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics from electronic devices, reports measurable product yields and composition, and includes experimental characterization of products and reactor conditions."
"Hydrocarbons obtained by waste plastic pyrolysis: Comparative analysis of decomposition described by different kinetic models Thermal degradation of waste polymers has been investigated in a batch reactor at temperatures of 410, 430 and 450°C using atmospheric pressure without catalysts. Raw materials were real wastes (plastics, paper, etc.), but considerably differences have been found among them. According to FTIR analysis raw materials contained polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and polyamide 6. The composition of plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.) was different, however in case of one sample (W-3) significant motor oil content has been demonstrated. Different hydrocarbon fractions were produced in the cracking reactions: gases, pyrolytic oil and heavy oil. The polymer destruction was described based on different reaction kinetic approaches (yields of volatile products, theory of continuous distribution, and number of scissions per an average polymer chain) and reaction kinetic parameters (e.g. activation energy of the degradation) have been calculated then results were compared. The values obtained have also been compared to literature data and try to reflect the complexity of pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis reactions could be well described by the used models. The calculated results well approached the data obtained from the literature, but due to the difference in raw material composition, the calculated kinetic parameters have been different, too.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PA6) in a batch reactor with measurable yields, product analysis, and kinetic parameter calculation."
"Boosting upcycling polypropylene waste to propylene via microwave catalysis Polypropylene waste presents both an environmental challenge and a valuable resource for sustainable chemical production. This study presents a direct microwave catalytic upcycling process using a Ru/α-Fe2O3 catalyst to efficiently convert polypropylene back into propylene, achieving a propylene yield of 57.2 wt% at 400 °C, which is the highest yield reported in literature. The recovered propylene can re-enter PP production or serve as a petrochemical feedstock, promoting circular economy goals. DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate catalytic behavior of Fe-O and Ru-O active sites in activation of C-H and C-C bonds. Microwave irradiation enhances reaction selectivity by rapidly and selectively energizing the catalyst. The catalyst exhibits stable performance over multiple reaction cycles under microwave conditions. This work provides a transformative strategy for converting plastic waste into valuable resources, driving sustainable advancements in polymer upcycling.","The study involves microwave catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene waste, achieving measurable propylene yield and catalyst performance data under defined reactor conditions."
"Catalytic conversion of commingled polymer waste into chemicals and fuels over spent FCC commercial catalyst in a fluidised-bed reactor A commingled post-consumer polymer (CPW#1) was pyrolysed over spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) commercial catalyst (ECat-1) using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The influence of reaction conditions including catalyst, temperature, ratios of commingled polymer to catalyst feed and flow rates of fluidising gas was examined. The conversion for spent FCC commercial catalyst (82.7wt%) gave much higher yield than silicate (only 14.2wt%) and the highest yield (nearly 87wt%) was obtained for ZSM-5. Greater product selectivity was observed with ECat-1 as a recycled catalyst with about 56wt% olefins products in the C3–C7 range. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reaction conditions. Valuable hydrocarbons of olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times used in this study. It is also demonstrated that the use of spent FCC commercial catalyst and under appropriate reaction conditions can have the ability to control both the product yield and product distribution from polymer degradation, potentially leading to a cheaper process with more valuable products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of commingled post-consumer polymer waste using a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis behavior of low-density polyethylene over HZSM-5 via rapid infrared heating Catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over HZSM-5 were carried out by using infrared heating technology. The effects of heating rate (1–30 °C/s), pyrolysis temperature (450–650 °C), and mass ratio of catalyst to LDPE (0:100 to 50:100) on product distribution and oil composition in LDPE pyrolysis were investigated, and the fast pyrolysis mechanism was explored. The results indicated that a higher heating rate, namely 20 °C/s, can remarkably enhance the liquid oil yield (93.42%), but the oil is heavy due to about 90% high‑carbon n-aliphatics. The addition of HZSM-5 performed an excellent effect on obtaining high-quality liquid oils, among which the total content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and iso-aliphatics obviously increase from 0.68% to 70.26%. The optimal HZSM-5/LDPE ratio of 10:100 was identified by considering the cost-effective factor. Furthermore, the lower catalytic temperature is favorable to the generation of light oil components, especially MAHs. The feasible generation paths were proposed, which mainly derived from the secondary reaction of the intermediate formed by initial chain cleavage including cyclization, aromatization, Diels-Alder reaction, as well as isomerization.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic fast pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Fast pyrolysis of polyurethanes and polyisocyanurate with and without flame retardant: Compounds of interest for chemical recycling To date, the recycling of polyurethane (PU) and polyisocyanurate (PIR) waste still poses a significant problem. Within this contribution, the thermal degradation of high-resilient ether PU, semirigid PU, rigid PU, and (PIR) with and without TCPP flame retardant was studied at different temperatures to identify and quantify the main products. For this, a tandem micropyrolyzer coupled to GC × GC with FID and ToF-MS detectors was used, and the yield volatiles, light gases, and residue was quantified. The volatile pyrolysis vapours obtained from pyrolyzing high-resilient ether PU and semirigid PU at 600 °C were very similar, and the main products obtained were ethylene and propylene (combined yield of ~13 wt%), ~16 wt% of various oxygenates, and 4–6 wt% organic nitrogen compounds. The oxygenates included mostly poly-ether type compounds with varying molecular weight, and these are attributed to the decomposition of the polyol chains forming the soft segments of the polymer. The main semi-volatile nitrogen compound was 4,4′-methylenedianiline, attributed to the decomposition of the hard segments in the PU structure synthesized from MDI. The pyrolysis vapours from rigid PU contained several ether-type compounds and high yields of heteroatom-free monoaromatics—in particular styrene. The PIRs were more difficult to decompose and volatilize than the PUs, resulting in ~20 wt% higher residue yields. The charring propensity was even higher in the absence of a flame retardant in the formulation. Pyrolysis of TCPP-containing PIR produced Cl-containing pyrolysis vapours such as allyl chlorides. While the yield of H2O was comparable for the different PUs and PIR, pyrolysis of PIR produced higher yields of CO2 and less CO compared to the different PUs. The use of catalysts can help to convert PU waste pyrolysis vapours more efficiently to desirable chemicals.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyurethane and polyisocyanurate plastics with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed chemical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Inhibition on Chloroaromatics during thermal conversion processes of Municipal Solid Waste by oxygen-induced low-temperature pre-dechlorination and hydrogen-assisted in-situ Cl capture In thermal treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), oxygen-induced low-temperature pre-dechlorination coupled with hydrogen-assisted Cl capture in subsequent pyrolysis was proposed as an economical and competitive way for the inhibition of chloroaromatics. Dechlorination and pyrolysis processes were experimentally investigated, and formation of chloroaromatics in both processes was quantitatively compared, using PVC as the model. Due to the low bond energy of CCl, most of Cl released at low temperature, ahead of common volatiles, providing a feasible temperature window for the pre-dechlorination of feedstock. Chlorobenzene and benzyl chloride were the major chloroaromatics in pyrolysis product, formed at 300 °C and higher temperature. Therefore, dechlorination should be proceeded below 300 °C to prevent the generation of chloroaromatics from itself. However, under inert atmosphere, dechlorination efficiency was heavily dependent on temperature, being poor at 250 °C and 275 °C. O2 had a clear inductive effect on low-temperature dechlorination, lowering the peak temperature of HCl release to 234 °C. After a 30 min oxygen-induced dechlorination at 250 °C, 97.525% of Cl in feedstock was removed, and chloroaromatics in the subsequent pyrolysis was reduced by 90.2%. For a further inhibition of chloroaromatics, 2% H2 was introduced for in-situ Cl capture in the pyrolysis of pre-dechlorinated feedstock, as a result, no chloroaromatic was detected.","The study involves experimental pyrolysis of PVC waste, with measured dechlorination efficiency, chloroaromatic formation, and product analysis under controlled reactor conditions."
"Non-oxidative conversion of real low density polyethylene waste into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials over MgO supported bimetallic Co-Mo catalysts with different total Co-Mo contents A series of bimetallic CoMo/MgO catalysts with different total metal contents from 10 up to 60 wt% and a fixed Co/Mo weight ratio of 4/1 were prepared and employed for the first time to transform real low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste into hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials through a two-stage process. The waste was thermally cracked at 500 °C to non-condensable gases which then decomposed over CoMo/MgO catalysts at 700 °C to obtain the desired products. Both fresh and spent CoMo/MgO catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, FTIR, Raman, BET, TEM, and TGA techniques. The results showed that the catalytic activity and stability were increased with the successive increase of CoMo content up to 40 wt%. Both 30CoMo/MgO and 40CoMo/MgO catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity where more than 90% H2 yield was obtained. This behavior could be attributed to the excessive formation of different types of mixed oxide species such as MgCoOx, CoMoOx and MgMoOx as shown from XRD, TPR and Raman results. In fact, the presence of these species enhances the dispersion and stabilization of Co and Mo particles in the catalyst matrix, resulting in improved catalyst performance. TEM, Raman spectra, and TGA results showed that high-quality CNMs with various structures such as regular, bamboo, cup stacked carbon nanotubes were deposited over all CoMo/MgO catalysts depending on the CoMo content.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of real low-density polyethylene waste using a two-stage process with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Thermogravimetric kinetic study of catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of PET bottles and micro carbon rod formation This study examined the thermogravimetric pyrolysis behaviour of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles using catalysts like ferrocene (F), red mud (RM), a Ni/Cu/Mo multicomponent catalyst on kieselguhr, and ferrocene-red mud mixtures, with or without hydrogen peroxide. Heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min were used. The Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) models determined activation energies (Ea), which were lower with catalysts compared to pure PET (189 kJ/mol). The lowest Ea (53 kJ/mol) was achieved with hydrogen peroxide, resulting in complete pyrolysis and no char. SEM analysis of the resulting char showed micro carbon rod (MCR) formations. The best catalyst can be chosen based on the needs of the final product. For example, if MCR creation is the goal, ferrocene and red mud may be the best choice; if full pyrolysis is the goal, H2O2 may provide the greatest result. The thermodynamic analysis, including ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS, indicated that the enthalpy values for catalyst-containing PETs are lower than those for pure PET. This suggests that the synergistic effect of catalytic pyrolysis likely reduces the energy required to form the activated complex during the thermal decomposition of PET.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of PET bottles with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including SEM and kinetic analysis."
"An experimental study on thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste using a continuous pyrolyser A bench scale, two-stage, thermo-catalytic reactor equipped with a continuous feeding system was used to pyrolyse pure and waste plastics. Experiments using five zeolitic and clay-based catalysts of different forms (pellet and powders) and different plastic feedstocks – virgin HDPE, HDPE w1aste and mixed plastic waste (MPW) were compared to the control experiments – pyrolysis without catalyst. Results indicated that the two pelletized catalysts were the most promising for the conditions employed. Of these two, one with higher acidity and surface area was highly selective for the gasoline fraction (C5–C11) giving 80% from the total medium distillate conversion using virgin HDPE as feedstock. It also produced the least amount of olefins (17% for virgin HDPE, 4% for HDPE waste and 2% for MPW) and coke (<1% for virgin HDPE, 3% for HDPE waste and 5% for MPW), and the highest aromatics content (22% for virgin HDPE from un-distilled medium distillate, 5% for HDPE and 13% for MPW both from distilled medium distillate). The second pelletized catalyst exhibited high selectivity for the diesel fraction (C12–C25) giving 63% from the total medium distillate conversion using virgin HDPE as feedstock. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst surface depended mainly on the mesopore volume, with less coke deposited as the mesopore volume increased. The variation in catalyst selectivity with acidity strength due to Lewis sites on the catalyst surface controls selectivity towards carbon chain length.","The study involves lab-scale thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, mixed plastic waste) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Multiple use of waste catalysts with and without regeneration for waste polymer cracking Waste plastics contain a substantial number of valuable chemicals. The wastes from post-consumer as well as from industrial production can be recycled to valuable chemical feedstock, which can be used in refineries and/or petrochemical industries. This chemical recycling process is an ideal approach in recycling the waste for a better environment. Polymer cracking using a laboratory fluidised bed reactor concentrated on the used highly contaminated catalyst, E-Cat 2. Even though E-Cat 2 had low activity due to fewer acid sites, the products yielded were similar with amorphous ASA and were far better than thermal cracking. The high levels of heavy metals, namely nickel and vanadium, deposited during their lifetime as an FCC catalyst, did not greatly affect on the catalyst activity. It was also shown that E-Cat 2 could be used with and without regeneration. Although there was more deactivation when there was no regeneration step, the yield of gases (C2–C7) remained fairly constant. For the first time, these results indicate that “waste” FCC catalyst (E-Cat) is a good candidate for future feedstock recycling of polymer waste. The major benefits of using E-Cat are a low market price, the ability to tolerate reuse and regeneration capacity.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics using a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"Comparing the effects of different metal oxides on low temperature decomposition of PVC Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is one of the most widely used plastics in the world. When PVC is heated, HCl will form, causing equipment corrosion, product quality decline, environmental pollution and other problems. Therefore, more attention is paid to recycling of PVC than other plastics. In this study, the reaction mechanisms of PVC with different metal oxides (MO x : CaO, ZnO, CuO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3) at low temperature (310 °C) were compared, with focus on chlorine capture and dehydrochlorination product (De-Cl PVC) property. The results showed that when the radius of metal ion was smaller, the extrapolated onset temperature (Ti ) of PVC-MO x pyrolysis tended to be lower, such as PVC-ZnO, PVC-CuO and PVC-Al2O3. Direct reaction of PVC and MO x was deduced for PVC-CuO and PVC-ZnO pyrolysis, based on the lower Ti and peak temperature (T max) than that of PVC pyrolysis. MO x that did not significantly lower T max was supposed to react with HCl that dissociated from PVC. The addition of ZnO significantly reduced the release of HCl (0.5%) and captured 97.6% of chlorine as inorganic chloride salts. However, the chloride salts produced from PVC-MgO pyrolysis could decompose at low temperature, thus releasing HCl again, and the C atoms in PVC-CuO system could react with copper chloride salts and H2O, to form and release HCl. The capture effects of chlorine by Fe2O3 and Al2O3 were not good. With addition of MO x , all De-Cl PVCs were rich in C=C-H and (C)3C-H structures. Fe2O3, MgO and CuO reduced the release of volatile hydrocarbons, while CaO, ZnO and Al2O3 increased the release of volatile hydrocarbons. Except for CaO and CuO, the other MO x increased the amount of residual hydrocarbon (De-Cl PVC).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PVC waste plastic with metal oxides, measuring chlorine capture efficiency, product composition, and reaction temperatures, with clear experimental data on yields and catalyst performance."
"Enhancing hydrogen production from municipal solid waste through an integrated pyrolysis and microbial fermentation approach Pyrolysis is a well-established method for hydrogen generation from municipal solid waste (MSW); however, limited research has explored its integration with microbial fermentation to optimize hydrogen yield. This study introduces an innovative two-stage process combining pyrolysis (450–900 °C) and microbial fermentation to maximize hydrogen production while enabling closed-loop resource utilization. The pyrolysis stage achieved peak hydrogen yields of 489.26 mL/g (580 °C, 500 mesh) and 475.24 mL/g (900 °C). Subsequently, a microbial agent (Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Clostridium spp., and PET-degrading strains) was optimized to ferment pyrolysis residues, yielding 301 mL/g hydrogen at 38 °C. Post-fermentation residues enhanced soil organic matter by 15 %, demonstrating dual benefits for energy recovery and soil remediation. This work advances sustainable MSW management by integrating thermochemical and biological processes, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon-neutral waste valorization.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (a waste plastic source) at specified temperatures, reports measurable hydrogen yields, and includes analytical characterization of products and conditions."
"Co-liquefaction of coal and polypropylene or polystyrene in hot compressed water at 360–430°C The co-liquefaction of coal and polypropylene or polystyrene in hot compressed water was carried out in a 50mL batch stainless steel autoclave reactor. The effects of the polymer ratios by weight (10–40%), reaction temperatures (360–430°C), and reaction time (30–120min) were investigated. The main products were analyzed qualitatively by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that the synergistic effect was demonstrated and the polymer stimulated coal liquefaction as a hydrogen donor during co-liquefaction in hot compressed water. The reaction temperature was the critical factor because the process of oil and gas generating by hydro-cracking, ring-opening and hydrogenation clearly occurred above 400°C and the conversion and yield of oil and gas reached a maximum of 75.92% and 69.11% at 420°C, respectively. The phase behavior during co-liquefaction in a fused-silica capillary reactor was recorded by a microscope during the heating and cooling processes, demonstrating that polypropylene melted to form a liquid phase as the reaction medium and hydrogen donor during co-liquefaction.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-liquefaction of waste plastics (polypropylene and polystyrene) with coal in a batch reactor, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product analysis."
"Low-temperature dechlorination methods for pyrolysis oil of municipal plastic waste Pyrolysis oil produced from municipal plastic waste can be utilized as fuel and various valuable chemicals as an alternative to petroleum. However, pyrolysis oil usually contains a relatively high concentration of chlorinated compounds, obstructing its utilization in the chemical industry. The present research reveals that pyrolysis oil contains inorganic chlorine and organochlorine compounds, and differentiated approaches should be considered to remove Cl from covalent and ionic chlorine linkages. Transition metal-based ZSM-5 catalysts showed remarkable dechlorination performance via mild C-Cl cracking of 1-chlorooctane and 4-chlorotoluene at 180 °C or below. The neutralization method of mixing pyrolysis oil with an alkaline solution quickly eliminated ionic chlorine from inorganic chlorine compounds, reducing Cl concentrations by up to 70 % at temperature below 40 °C. Based on the different dechlorinating pathways, an ideal combination of these two methods was suggested to enhance chlorine removal efficiency from pyrolysis oil.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste, with measurable product yields and analytical characterization of pyrolysis oil, including chlorine content reduction via experimental dechlorination methods."
"Impact of CO2 on the pyrolysis of mixed polymer wastes into combustible fuel: A case study for footwear waste Plastic waste is a promising resource for producing liquid fuels that can be integrated into existing hydrocarbon infrastructures. However, the heterogeneous nature of plastic-derived liquid fuels limits direct application in internal combustion engines, necessitating their refinement into a usable form. To address these issues, this study explored the enhancement of combustible gaseous fuels derived from plastic waste, footwear waste, as a viable alternative. This approach involves the introduction of carbon dioxide as a reactive feedstock during the pyrolysis process. Analytical techniques were employed to precisely determine the types and compositions of four polymers present in footwear waste. The compositional matrices of the primary pyrogenic products were also identified. However, incorporating carbon dioxide into pyrolysis leads to its interaction with volatile compounds, converting them into lighter gaseous products, particularly carbon monoxide. The homogeneous reactivity of carbon dioxide was further enhanced by the application of heat and a nickel-based catalyst. The gaseous product yield from catalytic pyrolysis in the presence of carbon dioxide increased proportionally with the test temperature. Specifically, the use of carbon dioxide led to a 1.92-fold increase in gaseous product yield at 700 ˚C, in reference to the results from nitrogen. This study demonstrates a technical advancement in pyrolytic valorisation of footwear waste by incorporating carbon dioxide and provides a detailed investigation into its mechanical role in maximising the production of combustible gaseous fuels.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (footwear waste) with measurable gaseous product yields and temperature-dependent performance data, using a nickel-based catalyst and CO2 as a reactive feedstock."
"Thermal degradation of various types of polylactides research. The effect of reduced graphite oxide on the composition of the PLA4042D pyrolysis products This study was aimed to investigate the effect of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the pyrolysis of polylactide composites (PLA4042D/rGO) prepared in solution. GC-MS analysis of PLA4042D/rGO pyrolysis products showed that introduction of rGO into the composition with PLA leads to a significant change in the ratio of main degradation products. A sharp decrease of five-membered dioxolanones accompanied by a growth in the content of lactides and cyclic oligomeric lactides was observed in PLA4042D/rGO pyrolysis products as compared with pristine PLA. DSC studies of PLA4042D crystallization in the melt showed that the adsorption of PLA macromolecules on rGO surface can cause the decrease in their segmental mobility. Apparently, a decrease in the segmental mobility of PLA chains hinders the formation of dioxolanones via the intramolecular nonradical ester interchange reaction. At the same time, the role of intermolecular reactions with the formation of cyclic oligomers of lactides increases.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic PLA4042D/rGO composites with measurable product yields and composition analysis via GC-MS, including temperature-dependent product changes and catalyst (rGO) performance."
"Effect of polypropylene on the pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene Pyrolysis of high impact polystyrene (HIPS), containing decabromodiphenyl oxide as brominated flame retardant (BFR) with Sb2O3 as a synergist (Br–Sb–HIPS), often leads to high concentrations of toxic brominated organic compounds in the pyrolysis oils which would detrimentally impact the reuse of these pyrolysis oils. In this work, the pyrolysis of Br–Sb–HIPS in the presence of polypropylene (PP) at different blending mass ratios using a fixed bed reactor at 410°C was performed to investigate what the effect of PP has on the pyrolysis of Br–Sb–HIPS. The thermal decomposition characterization of Br–Sb–HIPS and PP was investigated using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The pyrolysis oils were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). TGA revealed that there was a synergistic interaction between Br–Sb–HIPS and PP during co-pyrolysis process. More wax/oil and less gas were produced and the yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene and many other compounds in the pyrolysis oil reversely increased in the presence of PP. Moreover, PP was found to be effective to reduce bromine in the pyrolysis oil. When 30wt.% PP was blended into Br–Sb–HIPS, it could reduce the amount of bromine in pyrolysis oil to 38% of the original value.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (Br–Sb–HIPS and PP) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization (FTIR, GC–MS), and quantifiable results on bromine reduction and oil composition."
"New energy value chain through pyrolysis of hospital plastic waste In this paper, the evolution in thermochemical behaviours of hospital plastic wastes and changes in chemical composition and characteristics of pyrolysis liquid products have been investigated by using different fixed bed reactor scales. The main objective is to identify the critical technical parameters enabling thermochemical process adaptation in function of raw materials chemical structure, with the aim of maximising the yield of condensable fraction and optimising its energetic properties related to internal combustion engines. It is a step-by-step procedure using three reactor capacity levels, which allows various aspects approach of thermochemical process development from the evaluation of global reaction kinetic parameters to the measurement of physicochemical properties of the final pyrolysis products. In order to reduce the gas and solid fractions with corresponding increasing of condensable products, the transposition of thermal and kinetic information provided by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to larger reactors is used to control of process parameters. In this experimental work the mass of samples increases from 0.05 g in the thermogravimetric analyser to 600 g in the bench scale reactor. Gas-chromatography techniques have been used to identify the chemical composition of gases (GC/TCD) and liquids (GC/FID-MS). It was established that changing the reactor scale does not result in significant differences in pyrolysis product distribution, neither in gas composition. On the other hand, the aspect and the quality of condensable fraction display a high variability. Also, the energy contained in the final valuable pyrolysis product was compared with the energy demand during the thermochemical transformation in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the process.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of hospital plastic waste using fixed-bed reactors, with measurable product yields, chemical composition analysis via GC–MS, and energy efficiency evaluation."
"Exploratory study on the pyrolysis and PAH emissions of polylactic acid The emission factors for 16 U.S. EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the polylactic acid (PLA) pyrolysis and the decomposition mechanism were investigated in this study. The fragments and gas compositions using on-line thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) were determined. A temperature series of 7 fragments was analyzed in helium, and was found to include: m/z =16, which may represent methane; 28, which may be carbon monoxide; 44, which may be acetaldehyde; 56, which may be methylketene, 144, which may be oligomers of lactide. In addition, there are little amount of 100, and 200 which are oligomers of lactides observed in the pyrolysis of PLA. The pyrolysis of PLA is a non-radical, backbiting ester interchange reaction involving the OH chain ends. Depending on the size of the cyclic transition state, the product can be a lactide molecule, an oligomeric ring with more than two repeat units, methylketene, or acetaldehyde. Carbon monoxide and methane are contributions from the decomposition of acetaldehyde. Experimentally, not detected (n.d.)-40.47μg of 16 PAH emissions were determined from per gram of PLA pyrolysis. The PAH profiles showed a predominance of naphthalene (58.9%), phenanthrene (12.5%), and fluoranthene (5.9%). The total PAH emissions for PLA pyrolysis is significantly lower than the values associated with PLA combustion. From the viewpoint of air pollution control, this result suggests that pyrolysis seems a better alternative than combustion for the disposal of waste PLA. Also, since pyrolysis is the first step for an incineration process, these results can provide important information on the control of PAHs formation for a commercialized incinerator.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polylactic acid (PLA), a commercial plastic, using experimental methods including TG-MS analysis, temperature-dependent fragment identification, and quantification of PAH emissions, providing measurable product yields and composition data."
"Enhancing jet fuel range hydrocarbons production from catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir and low-density polyethylene over bifunctional activated carbon catalysts Low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts are vital to the conversion of solid wastes into biofuels or chemicals. In this study, a bifunctional activated carbon catalyst modified with Fe (Fe/AC) was obtained and applied to the catalytic co-pyrolysis of Douglas fir (DF) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using a facile fixed bed reactor. The effects of Fe loading amount, catalyst to feedstock ratio, and pyrolysis temperature on the product yields and distributions were studied. Results showed that the highest yield of bio-oil (53.67%) was achieved using 10Fe/AC at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C with a catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1. The main chemical compositions of the obtained catalytic bio-oil were aromatics, alkanes, and phenols. Increasing the temperature (450–600 °C) and catalyst to feedstock ratio (0.5–2) enhanced the selectivity of aromatics at the expense of phenols and alkanes. Compared to the AC catalyst, Fe/AC exhibited excellent performance on aromatics production (especially mono-aromatics) due to the newly created acid sites. The catalytic synergistic effect over 10Fe/AC significantly promoted the formation of aromatics through hydrogen transfer reactions which facilitated the dehydroxylation and demethoxylation of phenols. The present work provides a promising approach of converting biomass and plastic wastes directly into jet fuel range hydrocarbons by using green inexpensive carbon-based catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (a waste plastic) and biomass in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Gaseous products from primary reactions of fast co-pyrolysis of wood and plastic: The effect of CaCO3 This study investigates in-situ catalysis during fast co-pyrolysis of wood and plastic and focus on gases from the initial reactions. The materials were prepared through melt-mixing and include birch wood together with low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS). The co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted at 600°C with a residence time of 5 seconds. Introduction of CaCO3 resulted in increased yields of the gaseous compounds. Notably, the amount of gaseous compounds increased from 14 to 27 wt% for Wood-LDPE, from 17 to 31 wt% for Wood-PP, and from 44 to 81 wt% for Wood-PS. Particularly, compounds with a carbon number below 10 showed the most significant increase. This study contributes to a better understanding of the initial reactions of fast co-pyrolysis of wood and plastic. Specifically, it includes the impact of in-situ inorganic catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, PP, PS) mixed with wood, with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data reported."
"Pyrolysis kinetics and synergistic effect in co-pyrolysis of Samanea saman seeds and polyethylene terephthalate using thermogravimetric analyser This work deals with co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with Samanea saman seeds (SS) to understand the kinetics and synergistic effects between two different feedstocks. SS and PET were blended in different ratios (1:1, 3:1 and 5:1) and iso-conversional models such as Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Friedman method (FM), Starink (ST), Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method (OFW), and Coats-Redfern method (CR) were used to calculate the kinetic parameters. Results substantiate assumed hypothesis that blending of SS and PET at 3:1 provided higher synergistic effect and RMS value, which in turn indicated maximum formation of hot volatiles during pyrolysis. Kinetic analysis confirmed that individual SS and PET required higher activation energy while blended SS and PET at 3:1 ratio required lower activation energy to start the reaction. The thermodynamic and kinetic analysis confirmed that biomass had complex reaction kinetics which depends on reaction rate as well as its order.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic PET combined with biomass, using thermogravimetric analysis to measure product yields and kinetic parameters, with clear experimental data on temperature–yield relationships and catalyst-free synergistic effects."
"Catalytic activity of Ni-MgAl2O4 modified with transition metal (Ti, Mo, W) carbides as potential catalysts for resource recovery via dry reforming of waste plastics The growing amounts of plastic waste and CO2 emissions are two environmental threats that require urgent attention. Pyrolysis combined with dry reforming (PCDR) is a technology that allows both CO2 utilization and resource recovery from waste plastic. New catalysts for PCDR are crucial for developing efficient and stable processes that can be widely implemented in the industry. In this study, Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts modified using different transition metal (Ti, Mo, W) carbides were investigated in the PCDR of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) with emphasis on syngas yield, H2/CO ratio, product distribution, and catalyst deactivation. In addition, the effect of reforming temperature and process pressure was investigated. The catalysts were characterized using H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, N2 physisorption, XRD, TEM, XPS and TGA. The combined characterization and activity tests demonstrated that modification with different metal carbides affects the structure and activity of Ni/MgAl2O4 catalysts in relation to product yields, syngas composition, and catalyst stability. The investigation revealed that modification of nickel catalysts with different transition metal carbides enables manipulation of syngas composition, which is of great importance because different industrial processes require synthesis gas with different H2:CO ratios. Moreover, mixed outcomes were observed when different plastic feedstocks were used in the PCDR, indicating that different metal carbide-modified catalysts may be suitable for the process depending on the feedstock used. Regarding the effectiveness of synthesis gas production and catalyst stability, the most promising catalyst was the Ni-TiC/MgAl2O4 catalyst. According to the obtained results, modification with TiC resulted not only in increased synthesis gas production but also in reduced carbon deposition in PCDR of both LDPE and PS.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and PS) with measurable product yields, syngas composition, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Influence of hydrogen-donating solvents on liquefaction of polystyrene into fuel The increasing polystyrene (PS) waste accumulation presents a significant environmental challenge. This study investigates the liquefaction of PS using hydrogen-donating solvents such as ethanol, decalin, and tetralin to convert plastic waste into valuable liquid fuels. This research examines the effects of temperature, reaction time, and solvent type on product yield and quality. Optimal conditions were found at 380 °C and 30 min, with decalin achieving the highest liquid yield of 88.94 %. Hydrogen-donating solvents significantly improved conversion rates, liquid product distribution, and reduced oxygen content compared to non-hydrogen-donating solvents. Mechanistic analysis shows these solvents stabilise free radicals and promote secondary reactions, enhancing product quality. The functional group and carbon chain composition of PS liquefied oil is consistent with those of gasoline and diesel, highlighting its potential as a fuel oil. The results underscore the effectiveness of hydrogen-donating solvents in optimising PS liquefaction, suggesting a promising approach for sustainable plastic waste management. Future research should explore the environmental and economic feasibility of large-scale PS liquefaction and its application to other plastic types.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polystyrene waste using hydrogen-donating solvents, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Molten waste plastic pyrolysis in a vertical falling film reactor and the influence of temperature on the pyrolysis products Molten plastics are characterised with high viscosity and low thermal conductivity. Applying falling film pyrolysis reactor to deal with waste plastics can not only improve heat transfer efficiency, but also solve the flow problem. In this work, the pyrolysis process of molten polypropylene (PP) in a vertical falling film reactor is experimentally studied, and the influence of heating temperature on pyrolysis products is discussed. It has been found that with the temperature increases from 550°C to 625°C, the yield of pyrolysis oil decreases from 74.4wt% (±2.2wt%) to 53.5wt% (±1.3wt%). The major compositions of the pyrolysis oil are C9, C12 and C18, and β-scission reactions are predominant. The content of the light fraction C6–C12 of pyrolysis oil is 69.7wt%. Compared with other pyrolysis reactors, the yield of oil from vertical falling film pyrolysis reactor is slightly higher than that from tubular reactor, equal to that from rotary kiln reactor, and slightly lower than that in medium fluidised-bed reactor.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polypropylene in a vertical falling film reactor, with measurable product yields and temperature–yield relationships reported."
"The effect of HDPE and LDPE pyrolytic oils on cavitation formation in a common-rail diesel injector Plastic production and usage increase every year due to its practicality, adaptability, and low-cost production. The problem with plastic arises when it becomes waste and needs to be treated. Most of the plastic we use is produced from petrochemical material that can be used in resource recovery processes like pyrolysis to produce various materials. One of the pyrolysis process products is pyrolytic oil, whose properties are similar to conventional fuels. Minor differences in fuel properties can influence the injection process, in-nozzle flow condition, spray formation and break-up, the combustion process, etc. The presented paper aims to study the influence of pyrolytic oil‘s properties on cavitation formation in the injection nozzle of a common-rail injector. First, the pyrolytic oils were obtained from waste high- and low-density polyethylene using a pyrolysis reactor. Afterwards, the oils were characterized and implemented in the AVL FIRE computation program for studying their influence on cavitation formation in the injection nozzle hole. The obtained results indicate slight differences in fuel properties that influence cavitation formation and spread in the injection hole, which further influence conditions at the exit of the injection hole. The lower lower viscosity of pyrolytic oils influences lower friction in the fuel nozzle flow. The lower densyt and viscosity of pyrolytic oils promotes cavitation formation, advance time of it appearance at injection hole exit and influence the shorter presence of cavitation in the needle closing phase.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE and LDPE waste plastics to produce pyrolytic oil, with measurable product characterization and experimental data on fuel properties affecting cavitation in diesel injectors."
"Thermal degradation of polyethylene in the presence of a non-acidic porous solid by a continuous flow reactor Thermal degradation of polyethylene (PE) in the presence of a non-acidic porous solid (silicalite) was performed under atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow reactor, at 420 °C and feeding rate of 0–1.5 kg h−1. Conducting pyrolysis at steady state allowed observations on the behavior of polymers during thermal degradation. Based on collected information about reaction rates and the composition of pyrolysis products as well as of reactor content we could distinguish between the random and the chain-end scissions of polymer macromolecules and we showed that porous silicalite favored the later ones. Although silicalite had no acid reactive centers, it influenced the equilibrium attained at steady state and changed the composition of pyrolysis products. As a result, the rate of double bonds formation strongly increased with the silicalite amount; however the mass rate of pyrolysis was not significantly affected. The macroscopic mechanism for the thermal degradation of polymer explained why the amount of silicalite does not contribute to the improvement of the mass rate of volatilization.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene in a continuous flow reactor with measurable product composition and yield data, catalyst performance analysis, and reactor condition characterization."
"Bed defluidisation during the fluidised bed pyrolysis of plastic waste mixtures The risk of occurrence of phenomena inducing worsening of fluidisation quality and eventually leading to bed defluidisation is one of the major constraints to an easier utilisation of fluidised beds for the low-temperature pyrolysis of plastic wastes. In order to investigate these phenomena, different mixtures of plastic wastes, obtained by combination of three commercially-available recycled polymers, were fed to a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidised bed reactor. Two mechanisms of defluidisation were identified and the time at which defluidisation occurred was measured and correlated to a key variable of the process. The observed phenomenology was also simulated by means of room-temperature experiments carried out with a selected mineral oil. The results allow us to demonstrate the existence of a synergistic effect between the observed mechanisms of defluidisation.",The study involves lab-scale fluidised bed pyrolysis of commercial plastic waste mixtures with measurable defluidisation timing and experimental characterization.
"Effect of flame retardants and Sb2O3 synergist on the thermal decomposition of high-impact polystyrene and on its debromination by ammonia treatment Brominated high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) with 10.8wt% bromine (Br) coming from 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)oxide or 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)ethane flame retardant and with or without 5wt% antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) synergist were thermally degraded at 450°C into liquid products (oils). The composition of hydrocarbons and Br-containing compounds in oils was determined by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) or with mass selective detector (GC-MSD). It was found that the flame retardants had small effect on the composition of pyrolysis oils: 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)ethane increased the unsaturated compounds of PhCC type to the detriment of ethylbenzene. Contrary, the synergist had more remarkable effect on the pyrolysis of HIPS-Br. Decomposition started faster giving lower amount of gases, oils with higher density and more pyrolysis residue. Pyrolysis oils contained more saturated aromatic compounds (of Ph-C n H2n +1 type), more trimers and polycyclic compounds and less unsaturated Ph-CC compounds. Cyclisation and dehydrogenation of styrene dimers was inhibited therefore less phenyl- and phenylmethyl-naphthalene was produced. Ammonia acted as a trap for the hydrobromic acid. More than 90wt% of initial bromine in the samples was recovered as inorganic ammonium bromide. The Sb2O3 synergist had stronger debromination effect in the presence of ammonia.","The study involves lab-scale thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of brominated high-impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) with measurable product yields, compositional analysis via GC-MS/FID, and explicit experimental conditions and results."
"Experimental investigation on the influence of novel catalyst in co-pyrolysis of polymeric waste: Characterization of oil and preparation of char reinforced composites A massive challenge in handling and disposing the polymeric waste, generated by the growing human population and continuous development, has been faced currently as a result of human negligence. Fortunately, among many methods to deal with the problem of increasing polymer debris in the environment, pyrolysis stands out due to its efficiency and accessibility. In the present study, automobile plastic scrap (APS) and tyre crumb rubber (TCR) materials as a combination were subjected to co-pyrolysis using a novel catalyst (NOVC-FZP) that was synthesized using ferrocene and zeolite as precursors. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the raw materials (APS and TCR) shows single-stage decomposition at 402 °C and 340 °C, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis confirms higher production of the hydrocarbon (HC) groups in the oil with NOVC-FZP as compared to the neat oil (without NOVC-FZP). The cetane index of the oil with NOVC-FZP was found to be 22 and the calorific value of the same was 9162 Cal/g. A very high proportion of gasoline (86.8% of oil) was found in the oil resulting from the catalyzed pyrolysis. Solid product char (SPC) obtained through pyrolysis was incorporated into linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to form LLDPE/SPC composite (LCC) for use in several applications rather than disposing it off. Higher mechanical properties like tensile strength, hardness as well as enhanced dielectric constant were exhibited by the prepared LCC.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (automobile plastic scrap and tyre crumb rubber) with a novel catalyst, reporting measurable product yields, fuel properties, and analytical characterization."
"Chemical recycling of mixture of waste plastics using a new reactor system with stirred heat medium particles in steam atmosphere A new reactor system was developed for recovery fuels from the waste plastic mixture in steam atmosphere. Firstly, the degradation mechanisms of eight kinds of plastics, two polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene), two polyamide resins (nylon-6 and nylon-6,6), polystyrene and three polyesters (polycarbonate, poly(butylene terephthalate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate), were investigated both in nitrogen and steam as the carrier gas. Plastics except for polyesters were degraded without any influences of the kinds of the carrier gas, leaving negligibly small amount of carbonaceous residue. Polyesters, which were degraded with producing large amount of the residue in nitrogen, were succeeded to be hydrolyzed at high reaction rates in steam with producing hardly the carbonaceous residue. Secondly, a mixture of the waste plastics was continuously degraded to produce heavy oil in steam atmosphere by using a new reactor system. This system was composed of three kinds of reactors connected in series. One was a reactor filled with stirred heat medium particles, which enabled the high heat transfer rate, the high holdup and the good contact of the melted plastics with steam. The second was a tank reactor. The last one was a fixed bed reactor with FeOOH catalyst particles, which showed the catalysis in steam for the decomposition both of a wax and sublimate materials generated by the degradation of plastics. Furthermore, the oil produced from the proposed reactor system was continuously upgraded to produce gasoline and kerosene over Ni-REY catalyst in steam atmosphere.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics in steam atmosphere, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and catalytic performance analysis."
"Separate two-step and continuous two-stage pyrolysis of a waste plastic mixture to produce a chlorine-depleted oil In this study, a separate two-step pyrolysis (using auger and fixed-bed reactors) and a continuous two-stage pyrolysis (using auger and fluidized bed reactors) were conducted. This two-step pyrolysis was conducted to understand the effect of a 300 °C thermal pretreatment with the auger reactor before main pyrolysis on the chlorine removal. The fixed-bed pyrolysis of a solid product obtained after the pretreatment produced an oil with 464 ppm chlorine. An oil with only 14 ppm of organic chlorine could be obtained when a solid containing CaO was pyrolyzed in the fixed-bed reactor. Thermal pretreatment also caused changes in the yield and product composition; pretreatment led to an increase in gas yield and aromatic content of the oil. In the continuous two-stage pyrolysis of a waste plastic mixture having 3 wt% polyvinyl chloride at 730 °C, chlorinated gases were removed in parallel from the outlet of the auger reactor line and through a CaO hot filter; this produced an oil with 6.3 ppm organic chlorine. In the two-stage pyrolysis, an aromatic-rich oil (80 wt%) was obtained. The two-stage pyrolysis successfully converted the waste plastic mixture into an oil which could be acceptable as a feedstock for petrochemical industries.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastic mixtures using fixed-bed and auger reactors, with measurable product yields, chlorine content analysis, and reactor condition data."
"Mechanistic understanding of metal–acid synergetic hydroconversion of polyethylene under mild conditions over a Ru/MOR catalyst Hydroconversion has been demonstrated as a viable method to efficiently deconstruct polyolefins under relatively mild conditions. The hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds over Ru-based catalysts can convert polyolefins into liquid alkanes and methane. To suppress methane generation and obtain high-value isomer, further exploration of the mechanism for the cooperative deconstruction of polyolefins by bifunctional catalysts with metal–acid sites is necessary. In this study, we utilized ball milling to enhance the accessibility of acid sites within MOR zeolite, while the fragmented pore structure ensured that the loaded Ru metal was sufficiently accessible for long-chain alkanes. The sequential accessibility of metal–acid sites boosted the hydroconversion efficiency of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Through systematic investigations involving catalysts with various Ru loadings and Si/Al ratio of zeolites, it is discovered that the smaller-sized Ru particles not only facilitate the generation and desorption of olefinic intermediates in hydrocracking but also promote the hydrogenation and desorption of alkyls and suppress the cascade of terminal C–C bond cleavage in hydrogenolysis. Liquid fuel (C5-C21) yield was increased by 27% for the catalyst loaded with 0.7 wt% Ru on mMOR20 compared to 1.7 wt% loadings, while methane yield was only one-third of the latter. Concurrently, the distribution of acid sites on the zeolite surface affected the aggregation process of Ru atoms. This study deeply unveils the synergistic interaction of metal–acid sites, facilitating internal C–C bond cleavage to obtain liquid fuel and sheds light on catalyst design for waste polyolefins upcycling.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using a Ru/MOR catalyst, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance data, and detailed characterization of liquid fuel and methane production."
"Pyrolysis kinetic behaviour and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of Coronavirus Face Masks In the times of Covid-19, face masks are considered to be the main source of protection against the virus that reduces its spread. These masks are classified as single-use medical products with a very short service life, estimated at few days, hence millions of contaminated masks are generated daily in the form of hazardous materials, what requires to develop a safe method to dispose of them, especially since some of them are loaded with viruses. 3-ply face masks (3PFM) represent the major fraction of this waste and are composed mainly from polypropylene and melt blown filter with high content of volatile substances (96.6 wt.%), what makes pyrolysis treatment an emerging technology that could be used to dispose of face masks and convert them into energy products. In this context, this work aims to study pyrolysis kinetic behaviour and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of 3PFM. The research started with analysis of 3PFM using elemental analysis, proximate analysis, and compositional analyses. Afterwards, TG-FTIR system was used to study the thermal and chemical decomposition of 3PFM analyzed at different heating rates: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C/min. The GC/MS system was used to observe the synthesized volatile products at the maximum decomposition temperatures. After that, isoconversional methods, the advanced nonlinear integral isoconversional method, and the iterative linear integral isoconversional method were used to determine the activation energies of mask pyrolysis, while the distributed activation energy model and the independent parallel reactions kinetic model were used to fit TGA and DTG curves with deviations below <1. The TGA-DTG results showed that 3PFM can decompose in three different periods with a total weight loss of 95 % and maximum decomposition in the range 405−510 °C, while the FTIR spectra and GC–MS analysis exhibited that – CH (aromatic and aliphatic) and 2,4-Dimethyl-1-heptene (28–43 % based on heating rate) represented the major compounds in the released volatile components. Finally, Vyazovkin and the iterative linear integral isoconversional methods gave activation energies almost similar to that obtained by the KAS isoconversional method.","The study involves pyrolysis of polypropylene-based 3-ply face masks, a waste plastic, with experimental data on product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization using TG-FTIR-GC–MS."
"Catalytic fast pyrolysis over heavy metals-containing livestock manure biochar catalyst for polystyrene upcycling The perpetual market demand for polystyrene results in the gradual accumulation of polystyrene waste, placing a serious burden on the environment. This study proposed a promising method to upcycle polystyrene for styrene-derived monomers through catalytic fast pyrolysis. The metals-incorporated biochar catalysts were synthesized from heavy metals-contaminated manure waste for catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene. The experimental results showed that the bimetallic biochar-derived catalyst containing Zn and Cr (Zn-Cr/C) was more conducive to the liquid production, with an extremely high yield of 88.22 wt%. Monometallic Pb-incorporated biochar catalyst (Pb/C) and bimetallic Zn-Cu co-doped on biochar (Zn-Cu/C) were more favorable for the production of pure styrene, with the mass yield of 61.26 wt% and 60.39 wt%, respectively. Additionally, the study elucidated a deep understanding of the reaction mechanisms involved in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene. Simply put, this study introduced a new concept to convert heavy metal-contaminated animal manure into metal-incorporated biochar catalysts for catalytic conversion of polystyrene waste in pure styrene-based monomers.","The study involves catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene waste, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"Coupling dechlorination and catalytic pyrolysis to produce carbon nanotubes from mixed polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene The presence of chlorine in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) presents a major challenge for realizing the high-value utilization of real waste plastics. The objective of this research was to develop a chlorine-resistant process for the preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from mixed plastics containing PVC. This study investigates the influence of PVC content and various dechlorinating agents (CaO, Na2CO3, red mud (RM), ZSM-5, Fe-Al2O3, Fe(OH)3) on CNTs formation. The results showed that PVC content exceeding 5 % significantly inhibits CNTs formation. Employing dechlorinating agents in the pyrolysis process results in a substantial yield of CNTs from mixed plastics containing 10 % PVC. Among the dechlorinating agents, RM proves to be the most effective, leading to the highest carbon yield (at 30 wt%) and superior CNTs quality. Other dechlorinating agents, except for ZSM-5, yield comparable results, although there were some obvious variations of volatiles. Further investigation of the role of dechlorinating agents from the perspective of volatiles evolution was conducted via Py-GC/MS, and found that the dechlorination agent efficiently absorbs the HCl from mixed plastics pyrolysis, while also exhibiting catalytic and regulatory influence on volatile components. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of a chlorine-resistant process in the preparation of CNTs from mixed plastics that contain PVC.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste containing PVC and PE, with measurable yields of CNTs, carbon yield, and analytical characterization via Py-GC/MS."
"Two-stage thermal and catalytic cracking of polypropylene using natural clinoptilolite in a catalytic step to petrochemicals and fuels Raw natural clinoptilolite from the Slovak deposit in Nižný Hrabovec and clinoptilolite treated with solution of hydrochloric acid (0.1 M) were used to promote cracking of polypropylene (PP), as a representative of the second most common plastic in municipal waste, into valuable gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons. The influence of catalyst was studied using two-stage cracking apparatus. The process consisted of batch semiflow thermal cracking reactor connected to flow catalytic reactor operating at 450 °C. The cracking activity of fresh, unregenerated and regenerated clinoptilolite was studied. The cracking activity into gaseous hydrocarbons was the highest with fresh catalyst (28.1 % for raw and 53.4 % for acid-modified catalyst). It represented an increase of 11.3 % and 36.6 %, respectively, in comparison with thermal cracking. The content of valuable methylpropene in gas was markable (up to 27.1 wt %). It was confirmed that catalytic cracking of PP with unregenerated and regenerated catalyst was also effective although the cracking activity of those catalysts slightly decreased. All catalysts produced narrower range of C5-C14 hydrocarbons in the liquid fraction (mainly gasoline fraction) compared to thermal cracking (C5-C20 hydrocarbons).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) using catalytic cracking with natural clinoptilolite, reporting measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Impact of biogenic impurities on catalytic synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from polyolefin resins Biogenic impurities are common contaminants of plastic waste. This study investigated the effects of biogenic impurities on the conversion of a polyolefin mixture (6 wt% low-density polyethylene, 24 wt% high-density polyethylene, and 70 wt% polypropylene) into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and hydrogen via pyrolysis-chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Biogenic components from diverse sources were added to the polyolefin mixture, including lignocellulosic materials (pine sawdust, coconut coir pith), biosolids from wastewater treatment (municipal sewage sludge), animal-based waste (crustaceans), and bio-based plastic (polylactic acid). At contamination levels up to 9.1 wt%, 3 out of 5 impurities (coconut coir pith, sewage sludge and crustaceans) caused a decline in the conversion efficiency of feedstock into MWCNTs (33 ± 7% for polyolefins only compared with 20 ± 6%, 16 ± 1% and 16 ± 2% for polyolefins with 9.1 wt% coconut coir pith, sewage sludge and crustaceans, respectively). According to gas analysis, impurities led to a loss of catalyst activity, resulting in a decreased concentration of H2 and increased concentrations of methane and ethylene in the CVD gas. Furthermore, for polyolefins containing 9.1 wt% coconut coir pith, sewage sludge, crustaceans and polylactic acid, microscopy data revealed changes in the growth of filamentous carbon, leading to the appearance of carbon nanofibers in MWCNT samples. On the contrary, biogenic impurities barely changed outer diameters, ID/IG ratios, interlayer spacing, crystallite sizes of graphite-like sites, and the surface chemistry of MWCNT samples. The results suggest the development of quality management system for contaminated plastic feedstock could be advantageous to ensure consistent outcomes of pyrolysis-CVD process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (PE and PP) with biogenic impurities, reporting measurable yields, catalyst performance, gas composition, and product characterization via microscopy and gas analysis."
"Release and evolution mechanism of oxygen-containing compounds and aromatics during the co-pyrolysis of waste tire and bamboo sawdust/rice husk by Py-GC/MS Using the measurement technique pyrolysis gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry, the release characteristics of oxygen-containing compounds and aromatics during the pyrolysis of waste tire (WT) and the co-pyrolysis of WT and bamboo sawdust (BS)/rice hull (RH) were analyzed at low temperature (350 °C), medium temperature (550 °C) and high temperature (750 °C). The oxygen-containing compounds from the WT pyrolysis contained acids, phenols, alcohols, esters, peroxides and oxygen-containing heterocycles. Especially, the acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid presented the highest proportion of 8.68% at 350 °C. The oxygen-containing compounds proportion showed a sharply decreasing trend with the increase of temperature. The aromatics proportion was extremely low at 350 °C and 550 °C, while aromatics proportion was as high as 44.64%, including benzene, alkyl substituted benzene, indene, naphthalene and alkyl substituted naphthalene at 750 °C. The proportion of benzene, toluene and xylene was 17.05%, and that of naphthalene and its derivatives was 7.86%. After adding BS or RH, the aromatics proportion increased at 550 °C. The aromatics proportion decreased by more than 16% with the addition of BS, while the aromatics proportion increased with the addition of RH, such as benzene, indene and naphthalene derivatives. It was also found that the relative oxygen-containing components and aromatics proportion showed an opposite trend along the temperature. At 750 °C, oxygen-containing compounds could be converted into aromatics through a series of free radical reactions. For the WT pyrolysis, N-containing organic compounds proportion in gas product as the temperature increased. While the S-containing organic compounds were released into gas phase only at 550 °C. Adding BS could reduce the formation of N- and S- containing organic compounds. However, adding RH inhabited the N-containing organic compounds formation only at 350 °C. Adding RH also inhabited the formation of S-containing organic compounds formation, while this while this positive effect was weaker than that of adding BS. Finally, according to the obtained results from Py-GC/MS at different temperatures, it was found that the active oxygen-containing free radicals released from BS could promote the chain breaking of rubber components and release hydrogen free radicals. With the aggravation of hydrogen transfer reaction, the oxygen-containing organic compounds were continuously transformed into hydrocarbon products. Co-pyrolysis promoted decarboxylation and decarbonylation reaction, resulting in the formation of H2 and free radicals, thus promoting the generation of alicyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic chain hydrocarbons and benzene. This work provided the in-depth comparison and investigation the waste tire pyrolysis and products evolution.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tires (a plastic-derived material) with biomass, using Py-GC/MS to analyze product yields and composition at specific temperatures, with measurable data on oxygen-containing compounds and aromatics evolution."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of biodegradable plastic in CO2 atmosphere using MSW incinerator bottom ash for PLA monomer recovery This study proposes a method for recovering value-added monomers from abandoned biodegradable plastics such as used biodegradable straws (UBSs) by utilizing a catalyst made of bottom ash generated from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators. The MSW-derived bottom ash (MSW-BA) catalyst primarily comprises alkaline metal oxides such as CaO (58.88 wt%). Thermogravimetric and single-shot pyrolysis analyses show that polylactic acid (PLA) monomers—lactide and lactic acid—are the main products of UBS pyrolysis. We conducted catalytic pyrolysis of UBS at 500 °C under different atmospheres (N2 and CO2), with and without the MSW-BA catalyst. Compared with non-catalytic pyrolysis, the MSW-BA catalyst-based pyrolysis significantly increased the yield of PLA monomers in both N2 and CO2 environments. This is because the base sites present on the MSW-BA catalyst promoted the polymeric bond cleavage of PLA. The MSW-BA catalyst in CO2 achieved the highest recovery yield of PLA monomers (20.84 wt% per feedstock mass basis), which was approximately 17.75 % higher than that during non-catalytic UBS pyrolysis. The base sites present on the MSW-BA catalyst promoted polymeric bond cleavage of PLA, and the base-catalyzed pyrolysis of PLA was enhanced by the more reactive cleavage of the bond linkages in the presence of CO2. The proposed approach not only reuses biodegradable plastic waste but also utilizes the MSW treatment byproducts.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste biodegradable plastic (PLA) using a lab-scale reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Production of pyrolytic oils by catalytic pyrolysis of Malaysian refuse-derived fuels in continuously stirred batch reactor Malaysian refuse derived fuels (RDF) as valuable fraction of waste recycling were pyrolyzed in continuously stirred batch rig at 450°C in the presence and absence of catalysts. Different types of catalysts were used for upgrading both quantity and quality of pyrolysis products: Y-zeolite, equilibrium FCC, ZSM-5, Ni–Mo-catalyst, Co–Mo-catalyst, silica-alumina and alumina. Gas-chromatography, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and other standardized methods were used for the identification of product. RDF pyrolysis has produced gases with yields of 15.7–27.8%, pyrolytic oils of 9.8–17.8% and water (9.2–12.8%) depending on the types of applied catalyst. Data showed that the volatile fraction (both gas and pyrolytic oils) slightly increased with the catalyst, especially for Y-zeolite and ZSM-5. Gases consisted of CO, CO2, hydrogen and hydrocarbons. Main chemical compounds, such as aromatic, branched and non-branched in pyrolytic oils have been affected by catalysts, e.g. isomerization of main carbon frame and aromatization have been shown increasing in yields especially when Y-zeolite and ZSM-5 were applied. The phenol, benzene 1,3-diol and methyl-phenol content of pyrolytic oil obtained from non-catalytic pyrolysis decreased at 45.0%, 40.9% and 38.0%, respectively in the presence of Y-zeolite and at 39.4%, 36.9% and 26.9% over Co–Mo-catalyst compared to the catalyst free pyrolysis, respectively. Sulphur, nitrogen and chlorine were found as contaminants in pyrolytic oils, but their contaminants concentration could be significantly decreased by the use of catalysts. The activity of catalysts in the decrease of impurity followed the order of Ni–Mo-cat.>Co–Mo-cat.>Y-zeolite>FCC>ZSM-5>Al2O3/SiO2 >Al2O3. According to EDXRFS analysis, char consisted of impurities such as Ca, Ti, Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb elements.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastic-derived refuse-derived fuels with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition analysis, and analytical characterization."
"Enhancing polystyrene recycling: Temperature-responsive of pyrolysis in a pilot-scale vortex reactor This study evaluates the pyrolysis of polystyrene in a pilot-scale vortex reactor, focusing on styrene recovery and byproduct distribution at different temperatures. The vortex reactor’s unique design enables enhanced heat and mass transfer, coupled with reduced residence time, leading to minimized secondary reactions. Experiments were conducted at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C temperatures, with a comprehensive product analysis using GC×GC-FID and RGA. The results show that styrene recovery increases with temperature, reaching 86 wt% and 88 wt% at 600 °C and 700 °C, respectively. This is more than 15 wt% higher than classical continuous reactors such as stirred tanks or fluidized bed reactors. At higher temperatures, the production of undesired oligomers, such as dimers and trimers, decreases. Additionally, the yield of lighter aliphatic compounds increases at higher temperatures, suggesting further cracking of aromatic substituent groups. The findings demonstrate the vortex reactor’s potential in optimizing the pyrolysis process, making it a viable solution for efficient PS recycling.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a vortex reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Lumped-kinetic modeling and experiments on co-pyrolysis of palm kernel cake with polystyrene using a closed-tubing reactor to upgrade pyrolysis products Lumped-kinetic modeling and experiments (with validation) were performed on palm kernel cake/polystyrene (PKC/PS) blend co-pyrolysis in a closed-tubing reactor. The lsqcurvefit function and ode solver defined in the Matlab software were properly applied to predict the profile of product yields and to determine exactly the kinetic parameters of the reactions involved in PKC/PS blend co-pyrolysis. The different iso-conversional methods based on thermogravimetric analysis were used to calculate the activation energy needed for thermal decomposition of PKC, PS, and the PKC/PS blend. A synergistic effect existed in the blend of PKC/PS (with 20 wt% PS) because its activation energy was lower than that of the individual materials. The co-pyrolysis not only improved the quantity but also the quality of the bio-oil product, providing a high proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. The O and N contents of the bio-oil were reduced during co-pyrolysis via the hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodenitrogenation reactions. The highest heating value of the oil was 34.17 MJ/kg obtained in co-pyrolysis of PKC/PS at 773 K for 12 min. The co-pyrolysis increased the selectivity of H2 and hydrocarbon gases, and decreased the COx content. The biochar with high heating value and inorganic compounds content, and having a porous structure, can act as a catalyst and can be used as a solid fuel. This approach provides an efficient method for upgrading comprehensively the pyrolysis products using PS as the H2-donor source.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) with palm kernel cake using a closed-tubing reactor, with measurable product yields, fuel properties, and analytical characterization of bio-oil, gas, and biochar."
"Synergistic effects on char and oil produced by the co-pyrolysis of pine wood, polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride The synergistic effects of the woody biomass (pine wood (PW)) and plastics (polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) during co-pyrolysis on the properties of char and oil were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and fixed bed reactor. The results showed that PW-PE interaction increased the maximum weight loss rate of PW by 8.0–23.7%. Co-pyrolysis of PW-PE blends produced lower quantity of char (13.8–22.4%) and higher quantity of oil (3.7–4.4%) as compared to the theoretical results. PW-PVC interaction decreased the temperature corresponding to the maximum weight loss rate of PW by 47–51 °C. Co-pyrolysis of PW-PVC blends yielded more char (15.5–27.9%) and less oil (7.2–14.4%) than expected values. Also, the interaction of biomass and plastic materials decreased the H/C atomic ratio of char, which resulted in a higher chemical stability of char. The fuel quality of oil produced from mixtures was improved due to a lower O/C atomic ratio of oil as compared to the theoretical results.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PVC) with biomass, reporting measurable product yields, char and oil properties, and temperature–yield relationships."
"Experimental study of polystyrene thermolysis to moderate conversion A general model for polymer degradation by concurrent random and chain-end processes was developed using continuous distribution kinetics. Population balance equations based on fundamental, mechanistic free radical reactions were solved analytically by the moment method. The model, applicable to any molecular weight distribution (MWD), reduces to the cases of independent random or chain-end scission. Polystyrene degradation experiments in mineral oil solution at 275–350°C supported the model and determined reaction rate parameters. The degradation proceeded to moderate extents requiring a MW-dependent random scission rate coefficient. Throughout the experiments, the polymer MWD, which was measured by GPC, maintained the exponential form, so that the logarithm of MWD varies linearly with MW, with slope directly related to the number-average MW. Polystyrene random scission activation energy was 7.0 kcal/mol, which agrees well with other thermolysis investigations but is lower than that found by pyrolysis due to fundamental differences between the processes. Magnesium oxide, added as a heterogeneous catalyst in solution, was found to have no effect on polystyrene degradation rate.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polystyrene, a commercial plastic, with measured product yields, temperature-dependent degradation, and analytical characterization via GPC and kinetic analysis."
"Evolution of characteristic components from retired wind turbine blades in multiple thermal atmospheres: thermal decomposition characterization and kinetic behavior The lack of adequate data and in-depth insights into the thermal decomposition kinetics of retired wind turbine blades (RFTBs) critically impede its thermal recycling and upgrade. This study explores the non-isothermal pyrolysis of RFTBs under inert N2 atmosphere and reactive air and CO2 atmospheres at heating rates of 10–30 K/min. The PET component (C1) and full RFTBs component (C3) exhibited two pyrolysis stages (Py1 and Py2) in N2, whereas the glass fiber reinforced polymer (C2) revealed only one pyrolysis stage. Higher heating rates shifted peaks of heat weight loss rate upward due to thermal hysteresis. Under air and CO2 atmospheres, all feedstocks developed an additional gasification stage (Gs, >400 °C), originating from products undergoing partial oxidation reactions in air and interactions in CO2. Both pathways release heat that accelerates pyrolysis through localized thermal enhancement, effectively reducing heat transfer limitations via short-distance energy redistribution. Apparent activation energies for C3 obtained via Model-free fitting method were 148.43/181.34 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2, N2), 151.07/151.57/136.62 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2/Gs, air), and 67.76/87.79/78.85 kJ/mol (Py1/Py2/Gs, CO2), demonstrating that autothermal pyrolysis in air and CO2 gasification are more active and energy-saving than traditional pyrolysis in N2. Model-fitting method revealed optimal mechanisms involving random nucleation and nuclei growth (An, n = 4 for Py1, n = 2/3 for Py2 and Gs), accurately describing CO2 gasification of full RFTBs component, and these were validated through kinetic compensation effect analysis. This study provides accurate and critical guidance for the design, optimization and scale-up of RFTBs pyrolysis procedures and reactors.","The study investigates the non-isothermal pyrolysis of retired wind turbine blades, a waste plastic composite, under inert and reactive atmospheres with measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and analytical characterization."
"Stepwise pyrolysis of mixed plastics and paper for separation of oxygenated and hydrocarbon condensates Mixed plastics and papers are two of the main fractions in municipal solid waste which is a critical environmental issue today. Recovering energy and chemicals from this waste stream by pyrolysis is one of the favorable options to achieve a circular economy. While pyrolysis products from plastics are mainly hydrocarbons, pyrolysis products from paper/biomass are highly oxygenated. The different nature of the two pyrolysis products results in different treatments and applications as well as economic values. Therefore, separation of these two products by multi-step pyrolysis based on their different decomposition temperatures could be beneficial for downstream processes to recover materials, chemicals and/or energy. In this work, stepwise pyrolysis of mixed plastics and paper waste was performed in a batch type fixed bed reactor using two different pyrolysis temperatures. Neat plastic materials (polystyrene, polyethylene) and cellulose mixtures were used as starting materials. Then, the same conditions were applied to a mixed plastics and paper residue stream derived from paper recycling process. The condensable products were analyzed by GC/MS. It was found that pyrolysis temperatures during the first and second step of 350 and 500 °C resulted in a better separation of the oxygenated and hydrocarbon condensates than when a lower pyrolysis temperature (300 °C) was used in the first step. The products from the first step were derived from cellulose with some heavy fraction of styrene oligomers, while the products from the second step were mainly hydrocarbons derived from polystyrene and polyethylene. This thus shows that stepwise pyrolysis can separate the products from these materials, although with some degree of overlapping products. Indications of interaction between PS and cellulose during stepwise pyrolysis were observed including an increase in char yield, a decrease in liquid yield from the first temperature step and changes in liquid composition, compared to stepwise pyrolysis of the two materials separately. A longer vapor residence time in the second step was found to help reducing the amount of wax derived from polyethylene. Results from stepwise pyrolysis of a real waste showed that oxygenated and acidic products were concentrated in the liquid from the first step, while the product from the second step contained a high portion of hydrocarbons and had a low acid number.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste and paper in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and GC/MS analysis of condensable products."
"Insights into the coke deposited on HZSM-5, Hβ and HY zeolites during the cracking of polyethylene The effect of the zeolite structure (HZSM-5, Hβ and HY) on coke deposition during the cracking of high-density polyethylene has been studied by combining the results of multiple spectroscopic and analytical techniques: FTIR, Raman, UV–vis, 13C NMR and coke extraction, followed by GC-MS and 1H NMR analysis. In addition, by combining FTIR and temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis we obtained information on the coke: properties, burn-off, and changes in composition during catalyst regeneration. Samples of the spent catalysts were obtained in a state-of-the-art pilot plant (conical spouted bed reactor) after the continuous treatment of 900g (1gmin−1, 15h) of high-density polyethylene at 500°C, using 30g of catalyst. The results show that as the pore diameter of the zeolite is increased, bimolecular reactions (hydrogen transfer and oligomerizations), condensations and cyclizations are enhanced, yielding more aromatic coke. Furthermore, the pore topology of the HZSM-5 zeolite improves the flow of coke precursors (also favored by the high flow rate of N2) to the outside of the catalyst; viz. HZSM-5 catalyst preserves its activity for longer.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene using zeolite catalysts in a pilot plant reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization of coke and products."
"Kinetics of synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic wastes Co-pyrolysis of pinewood and different kinds of plastic wastes in different mass fractions using polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), and polycarbonate (BPC) were investigated. The results compared with the pyrolysis of individual components revealed non-additive synergistic effects from co-pyrolysis. Differential thermography (DTG) results showed enhanced decomposition peaks of biomass along with longer evolution of syngas and decreased peak of plastic polymers using BPC or PETE. Char residue was non-additively reduced by some 5% (dry wt. basis) using PP and BPC, and by 2–3% using PETE when pyrolyzed with biomass. This suggests increased carbon conversion efficiency and volatiles yield during co-pyrolysis compared to individual component pyrolysis. First order distributed activation energy modeling (DAEM) with 5 pseudo-components revealed that the synergistic effects of biomass with PP or PETE were mainly due to physical nature of the polymers as observed from increased activation energy bandwidth of biomass decomposition. BPC and pinewood mixtures showed an overlap in their activation energy distribution between 100 and 150 kJ/mol. This overlap caused the set of reaction with similar energetics to mutually interact chemically and enhance the composite mixture pyrolysis. Activation energy of BPC in the presence of pinewood was reduced by some 50 kJ/mol compared to individually examined polymer decomposition. The observed quantitative synergistic kinetics results in co-pyrolysis of biomass-plastic wastes mixtures as compared to individual component pyrolysis provide vital information towards the development of feed-flexible, clean pyrolysis and gasification system for efficient fuels production.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, PETE, BPC) with biomass, reports measurable product yields, char residue reduction, and kinetic analysis using experimental data from DTG and DAEM modeling."
"Enhancing hydrocarbon production via ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and high-density polyethylene: Study of synergistic effect and aromatics selectivity We conducted ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of corn stalk (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over HZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the production of hydrocarbons. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and CS-to-HDPE mass ratio (CS/HDPE) on the yield of condensable volatile organic products (CVOPs) and the relative content of hydrocarbons were studied. The synergisms between CS and HDPE were determined based on the difference between the experimental and theoretical CVOP and hydrocarbons content. The results showed that the addition of HDPE significantly promotes the production of CVOPs, reaching the maximum value at 750 °C. In the presence of HZSM-5, the CVOP and hydrocarbons production, especially aromatics, were enhanced further, and 650 °C and 700 °C were the preferable pyrolysis temperature for desired products. Benzene, toluene, and xylenes were the predominant aromatics during the CFP process due to the good shape-selectivity of HZSM-5, contributing to the highest selectivity of C5–C11 compounds in C5+ hydrocarbons. CS/HDPE mass ratio of 1:1 was a critical point for enhancing aromatics yield. CS/HDPE < 1 was the recommended mass ratio for increasing the relative aromatic hydrocarbons content, which increases as the CS/HDPE mass ratio decreases. Meanwhile, we presented the potential reaction pathways between CS and HDPE to explain the synergistic effects during the co-CFP process.","The study involves lab-scale ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) and biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Process intensification on co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate wastes and biomass via microwave energy: Synergetic effect and roles of microwave susceptor The present study employs microwave (MW) energy to enhance the co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes and biomass. Based on the characterization of raw materials as well as gas and liquid products, we propose a pyrolysis mechanism of PET and biomass during microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). The MAP of PET-biomass blends shows a synergetic effect that the interaction between PET and biomass promotes the yields of value-added products (e.g. aromatic acids and phenols) and suppresses the generation of biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to the MAP of individual biomass or plastics. Besides, the blending ratio of PET-biomass has significant effect on the formation of major liquid products. The liquid product from the MAP of PET-biomass 4:1 blends contains above 30 wt.% chain hydrocarbon that can be used as gasoline and kerosene. Moreover, we evaluate the roles of three typical MW absorbing materials during MAP, including carbon powder, ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) and calcium oxide (CaO). Carbon powder can enlarge the yield of main products from plastics pyrolysis due to its significant dielectric loss. Apart from the MW-absorbing ability, Fe3O4 can accelerate the esterification and decarboxylation reaction; CaO can convert acids into ketones and hydrocarbons through neutralization and catalytic cracking reactions.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of waste PET and biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst effects, and product composition analysis."
"Thermal decomposition of polymer mixtures of PVC, PET and ABS containing brominated flame retardant: Formation of chlorinated and brominated organic compounds The thermal decomposition of various mixtures of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS), ABS containing brominated epoxy resin flame retardant and Sb2O3, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) has been studied in order to clarify the reactions between the components of mixed polymers. More than 40 halogen-containing molecules have been identified among the pyrolysis products of mixed samples. Brominated and chlorinated aromatic esters were detected from the mixtures containing PET and halogen-containing polymers. A series of chlorinated, brominated and mixed chlorinated and brominated phenols and bisphenol A molecules have been identified among the pyrolysis products of polymer mixtures containing flame retarded ABS and PVC. It was established that the decomposition rate curves (DTG) of the mixtures were not simple superpositions of the individual components indicating interactions between the decomposition reactions of the polymer components. The maximal rate of thermal decomposition of both ABS and PET decreases significantly if the mixture contains brominated epoxy flame retardant and Sb2O3 synergist. The dehydrochlorination rate of PVC is enhanced in the presence of ABS or PET.","The study involves lab-scale thermal decomposition of waste plastics (PVC, PET, ABS) with measurable product identification, yield-related observations, and analytical characterization of halogenated compounds."
"Co-pyrolysis of bamboo residual with waste tire over dual catalytic stage of CaO and co-modified HZSM-5 Experiments for an upgraded liquid oil production via fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo residual and waste tire over two catalytic beds of CaO and HZSM-5 were conducted, and the effect of CaO to HZSM-5 mass ratio on pyrolytic products distribution was investigated and analyzed. Furthermore, a novel modification method for enhancing the catalytic performance of HZSM-5 by an integrated alkali treatment and hydrothermal process was carried out, and the influence of co-modified HZSM-5 on products distribution was also studied. Experimental results revealed that the catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of bamboo residual and waste tire increased the relative contents of aromatics and olefins. Simultaneously, a use of dual catalytic stage of CaO and HZSM-5 further facilitated the relative contents of aromatics and olefins significantly, and inhibited the formation of undesirables like acids. A maximum yield of hydrocarbons could be reached at HZSM-5 to CaO mass ratio of 3:2. Furthermore, the co-modified HZSM-5 promoted the relative contents of aromatics and olefins compared with the fresh ones, which showed great promise for upgrading the quality of liquid oil.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of waste tire and bamboo residual, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis using dual catalytic stages."
"Catalytic pyrolysis kinetic behaviour and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of waste fishing nets over ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst for caprolactam recovery Caprolactam is the main compound of nylon 6 waste fishing nets (WFNs) and its recovery conserves natural resources, maximizes WFNs economic performance, and closes the circular economy loop of the fishing net industry. Within the framework and as a part of the Healthy Seas’ initiative to clean the oceans from waste fishing nets (WFNs), and to valorise it, this research aims to study the catalytic pyrolysis behaviour of the WFNs extracted from oceans in order to study their potential applications in the energy conversion field. The catalytic pyrolysis experiments of WFNs over ZSM-5 Zeolite catalyst (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 wt%) were conducted using thermogravimetry (TG) coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at different heating rates (5–30 °C/min). Also, the kinetics of ZSM-5/WFNs catalytic pyrolysis was studied by model-free methods (KAS, FWO, and Friedman). In addition, the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) and the independent parallel reaction kinetic model (IPR) combined with the optimization algorithm were used to fit the TGA-DTG experimental data and to calculate the parameters that can achieve the minimum deviation. The TGA results showed that the main decomposition zone was located in the range 342–476 °C with a total weight loss 83-75 wt% (based on the amount of catalyst). Meanwhile, FTIR and GC-MS results manifested that alkyl C–H stretch functional group, carbonyl functional group (CO), and caprolactam (83.15%; at 20 wt% of ZSM-5) are the main groups and volatile compounds in the decomposed WFNs samples. The model-free kinetics analysis showed that all activation energies were estimated at 112 kJ/mol (WFNs) and 158, 230, 197, 201, and 220 kJ/mol for ZSM-5/WFNs samples (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 wt%). At the same time, DAEM and IPR models proved a high prediction to fit TG curves at all heating rates. Based on these results, catalytic pyrolysis using 20 wt% of ZSM-5 can be used as a promising technology for extracting caprolactam from WFNs with high yield (83%). The recovered caprolactam can be used in the production of nylon fibres, nylon thin films, carpets, textiles, resins, etc.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste fishing nets (a commercial plastic waste) using ZSM-5 zeolite in a lab-scale setup with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and kinetic data from TG-FTIR-GC–MS experiments."
"Two-stage thermochemical conversion of polyethylene terephthalate using steam to produce a clean and H2- and CO-rich syngas This study deals with thermochemical conversion of polyethylene terephthalate using steam and a two-stage process having fluidized bed packed bed reactors. In the study, the temperatures of the fluidized bed reactor and packed reactor were varied in the range of 600–800 and 700−800 °C, respectively. In the experiments, active carbon used as a tar removal additive sharply increased the yields of syngas, char, H2, and CO and decreased the condensed tar yield. Although toluene, styrene, naphthalene, biphenyl, and anthracene were found in the syngas obtained without active carbon, none were found in the experiment with active carbon. The tar content in the gas with active carbon was 13 mg/Nm3. A high tar-cracking reactor temperature and a high steam/fuel ratio favored the production of syngas and H2. In the present study, the highest H2 yield was 93 g/kg-feed, the highest H2 content in syngas was 53 vol%, and the CO yield was 418 g/kg-feed. Also, a long-term thermochemical conversion of PET was explored for 4 h, and there were no operational problems during the experiment. In the long-term operation, tar appeared only after 2 h reaction time, and anthracene appeared only in the gas sample drawn after 4 h reaction time.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in fluidized and packed bed reactors, with measurable yields of syngas, H2, CO, and tar, along with analytical characterization of products."
"An exploratory study of the processing of plastics, by means of pyrolysis, with the emphasis on PVC/aluminum combinations The feasibility of an alternative process for the processing of plastic/aluminum combinations by means of pyrolysis has been studied. Below the melting temperature of aluminum, the main fraction of the plastics can be devolatilized. As the plastic fraction often mainly consists of PVC, it is more economical to incinerate the pyrolysis products on-site, in combination with HCl removal and heat recovery. In the case of a high concentration of other plastics, e.g. ABS and PET, it is possible to get a valuable pyrolysis oil. Degradation of PVC mainly occurs through elimination of side groups, i.e. chlorine. 90% or more of this chlorine can be released as HCl. During pyrolysis of PVC, hardly any formation of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofuranes occurs. Depolymerization is the main degradation route of the styrene fraction in ABS (70 wt. %). Reactions of functional groups in the main chain take place during degradation of PET.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PVC, ABS, PET) with measurable product yields and degradation mechanisms analyzed, including chlorine release and depolymerization pathways."
"Multifaceted analysis of products from the intermediate co-pyrolysis of biomass with Tetra Pak waste This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of two types of biomass (pine bark and wheat straw) with Tetra Pak waste (TPW). The experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor equipped with an innovative system, where a sample was rapidly heated to 600 °C before being rapidly cooled. The multifaceted analysis included the determination of the i) physical and chemical properties of the feedstocks and chars, ii) aqueous phase, tars, and waxes, iii) char ignition and burnout temperature, iv) chemical composition of gas, and v) distribution of carbon and hydrogen in the obtained products. The results showed that the addition of TPW to the both types of biomass significantly reduced the char mass and aqueous phase, decreased the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents of the char, and increased the wax and tar yields retained in the water cooler. Different organic compounds such as alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and acids were found in tars and waxes. The chemical composition of the released gases was detected in situ (by a flue-gas analyser) and ex-situ (using gas chromatography). Changes in the concentrations of H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and C2–C4 were observed. The addition of Tetra Pak to the two types of biomass had an evident and positive effect on the hydrogen content of the pyrolysis gas.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of Tetra Pak waste, a type of plastic-containing waste, with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and reactor conditions reported."
"Influence of the final “ageing” temperature on the regeneration behaviour and location of the coke obtained in the HZSM-5 and USY zeolites during the LDPE cracking In this work, the influence of the “ageing” temperature on the location and regeneration behaviour of the coke obtained in the cracking of LDPE in the presence of HZSM-5 and USY zeolites is studied. The coke content in the zeolites is influenced by the thermal treatment, and for both zeolites studied, the higher the final cracking temperature the lower the coke content. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms have shown the different deactivation mechanisms, related to the possible different locations of the coke on each zeolite and the influence of the final cracking temperature on these parameters. The regeneration study of the coked zeolites has shown that the coke combustion process strongly depends on the insoluble content of the coke (i.e., of the presence of bulky polyaromatic compounds) and of the zeolite framework.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of LDPE using HZSM-5 and USY zeolites, with measurable product yields, coke content, and analytical characterization of regeneration behavior and coke location."
"Insight into the engine performance of pyro-oil synthesized through catalytic co-pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics in the presence of dolomite modified with silica and ZSM-5 The production of hydrocarbon-rich liquid fuels from mixed waste plastics through the catalytic pyrolysis process is reported including engine performance. Four different catalysts, viz., DOL, SiDOL, ZSM-5, and ZSMDOL, were prepared and characterized using XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM, and EDX. The catalytic activity was assessed in pyrolysis process to produce pyro-oils. The fuel properties were determined using various ASTM methods. The analysis showed that catalysts can change fuel properties such as viscosity, density, cloud & pour points, flash & fire points, calorific values, etc. The GC–MS results suggested a higher fraction (66–85%) of lower hydrocarbons (<C12) are formed during catalytic cracking as compared to thermal cracking (∼51%). FTIR and NMR analysis confirmed the presence of different hydrocarbons (paraffin, olefin, and aromatics) in pyro-oils. A higher percentage of aromatic hydrocarbons was seen with ZSM-5 catalyst due to diffusion of primary pyrolysis products into catalyst pores resulting in formation of aromatics via a common hydrocarbon pool and higher H/C value in the feedstock. Engine performance test with 10% pyro-oil blending enhanced the brake-thermal efficiency by 1.01–10% and reduces brake-specific fuel consumption by 8.72–10.1%. On the other hand, CO emission was reduced by 40.4%, 20%, 16.1%, 8.9%, and 6.2% when commercial diesel was blended with PO-NC, PO-DOL, PO-SiDOL, PO-ZSM, and PO-ZSMDOL, respectively. Similarly, the emissions of HC and NOx were reduced by 61% and 10.85%, respectively, when the pyro-oil blend was used. Approx. 54% reduction in carbon residue was also achieved in the case of catalytic pyro-oils blended fuel sample.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, fuel properties, and engine test results, including GC–MS, FTIR, and XRD analysis."
"Catalytic degradation of polyolefins over hexagonal mesoporous silica: Effect of aluminum addition Degradations of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) over pure hexagonal mesoporous silica and aluminum-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica catalysts were studied in a fixed bed catalytic reactor at 380 and 430°C, respectively. The thermal and catalytic degradations of both PP and PE in liquid-phase-contact and vapor-phase-contact modes over pure hexagonal mesoporous silica had no significant effect on the product yields. The liquid products were widely distributed in hydrocarbons with boiling point ranges of 36–405°C. By adding a small amount of aluminum to the hexagonal mesoporous material, aluminium-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica exhibited good performance in cracking heavy molecular weight hydrocarbons into light hydrocarbons. High liquid yields and less coke deposits were obtained in liquid-phase-contact reaction with increasing aluminum content. The liquid products were mainly composed of C5–C10 hydrocarbons with boiling points of 36–174°C, and propene, butene, and butane were main components in gaseous products. The effect of degradation temperature was not observed on product yields though degradation rate of polyolefin into liquid products was faster. Conversely, in vapor-phase-contact reaction, an increase in gaseous yield was observed when increasing the amount of aluminum and temperature of the cracking reactor, while the residue yield remained constant.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins (PP and PE) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature effects, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Assessment of heating rate and mixing ratio on the synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and high-density polyethylene The co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics presents a promising approach for generating hydrocarbon fuels and high-value chemicals while addressing environmental pollution concerns. This study investigates the pyrolysis process by examining mixtures of pine sawdust (PS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with varying mass proportions and heating rates using analytical methods including thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) coupled analysis, pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and kinetic analysis. The study highlights the impact of heating rate on product distribution, with significant changes observed when the biomass ratio is at 30 %. Moreover, the addition of high-density polyethylene leads to an increase in polyol content in the liquid product. Analysis of product types reveals that plastics act as “hydrogen donors,” supplying hydrogen to biomass during co-pyrolysis, thus reducing oxygen chemicals. Results from the kinetic analysis show that the activation energy for co-pyrolysis is lower than individual pyrolysis, also indicating a synergistic effect. Overall, this research provides insights into the synergistic benefits of co-pyrolysis and establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing co-pyrolysis technology.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and pine sawdust with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization using TGA-DSC, TG-FTIR, Py-GC-MS, and kinetic analysis."
"Recovery of renewable aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon resources from microwave pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis of agro-residues and plastics wastes The present study focussed on recovering the valuable carbon resources from agro-residues (wheat straw, rice husk) and waste plastics (polypropylene, polystyrene) using microwave pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the susceptor blending mechanism on the co-pyrolysis product distribution. Graphite was mixed with feedstock in a new approach to achieving homogeneity, and microwave power of 600 W was used. The average heating rate (52–67 (°C/min)), microwave energy required (2267–2936 (J/g)), heat energy utilized (1410–1444 (J/g)), and conductive heat losses (85–110 (J/g)) were analyzed. The selectivity of cyclic alkanes and alkenes (65.5%) was found to be high in polypropylene pyrolysis oil. Polystyrene pyrolysis oil predominantly contained cyclooctatetraene (61%) compound. Bio-oil obtained from wheat straw predominantly contained aromatic hydrocarbons (85%), whereas rice husk oil also contains high selectivity aromatic hydrocarbons (37.8%) along with aliphatic hydrocarbons (54.9%). The co-pyrolysis oils has high selectivity of aromatics.","The study involves microwave pyrolysis of waste plastics (polypropylene, polystyrene) and agro-residues, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Kinetics and characteristics of activator-assisted pyrolysis of municipal waste plastic and chlorine removal using hot filter filled with absorbents Pyrolysis of municipal waste plastic was conducted using a two-stage pyrolysis process with auger and fluidized bed reactors. The current study comprises two parts: a kinetic study and pyrolysis experiments using activator-assisted pyrolysis. The kinetic study was performed using the distributed activation energy model, and it revealed that the average activation energy for activated molecules was 7 kJ/mol lower than that for unactivated molecules. The pyrolysis experiment confirmed that the activation of molecules resulted in an enhanced gas production. In particular, the methane and ethene yields increased by 11 and 8 wt%, respectively, when molecules were activated. A higher flow rate of the product gas used as the fluidizing gas resulted in a decrease in the gas yield. CaO and Na2CO3 were used as absorbents for chlorinated compounds produced during pyrolysis to reduce the level of Cl in the oil. The absorbents, at first, changed the product distribution, enhancing the production of mono-aromatics. In particular, the benzene yield with Na2CO3 amounted to 10 wt%. The two absorbents were excellent in reducing the Cl content in oil. Between the two absorbents, Na2CO3 proved to be the better, reducing the Cl content to 65 ppm.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of municipal waste plastic using fluidized bed and auger reactors, with measurable product yields, catalyst absorbent performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"A fluorine-restrained pyrolysis process for sustainable photovoltaic modules recycling: two-stage decomposition of EVA and fluorine-containing backsheets Annually accumulating decommissioned Photovoltaic modules pose severe environmental risks. Pyrolysis is key for resource recovery via disassembly, but conventional 500 °C pyrolysis produces hazardous fluorinated pollution. This study analyzed pyrolysis mechanisms for EVA encapsulant and fluorinated KPK backsheets (PVDF/PET/PVDF) using thermal, IR, and MS techniques. Key findings: (1) EVA pyrolyzes in two stages: dominant deacetylation (300–400 °C), then chain scission (400–500 °C); (2) PVDF decomposition (300–600 °C) releases most fluorine as gaseous pollutants (e.g., 1,2,4-trifluorobenzene, SiF₄), leaving fluoride-containing solid residues; (3) The major KPK weight loss peak (350–500 °C) stems primarily from PET. Exploiting these thermal properties, a novel two-stage, fluorine-controlled process is proposed: First, heat to 350 °C to trigger intense EVA deacetylation and adhesion loss before significant PVDF cracking, allowing non-polluting backsheet removal. Then, raise temperature to 500 °C to fully pyrolyze residual EVA. This clarifies fluoride pathways and offers a practical emission-mitigation solution for thermal dismantling.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (EVA and fluorinated KPK backsheets) with measurable thermal decomposition stages, product analysis, and proposed process optimization based on experimental data."
"Experimental determination of quantitative yields from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) flash pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor via online FTIR gas analysis Chemical recycling processes, such as pyrolysis, have the potential to break down the polymer (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA) into its main building blocks (monomers), and thus enable the preservation of full functionality in closed-loop recycling processes. In this study, products from flash pyrolysis of PMMA are quantitatively determined using an ex situ exhaust gas analysis by means of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To achieve this, the FTIR is additionally calibrated for methyl methacrylate (MMA) with an MMA/N2 mixture of various concentrations. Flash pyrolysis conditions (heating rates approximately 10 3 K s − 1 ) are realized with a small-scale fluidized bed reactor operated with a nitrogen atmosphere and temperatures between 573 and 873 K with a continuous feed of PMMA granules. The experiments reveal MMA yields up to 90 % at 673 K. With increasing temperature, the MMA yield drops to approximately 50 % at 873 K. In return, the yields of the MMA decomposition products such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), propylene (C3H6), and formaldehyde (CH2O) increase. The approximated residence time of 20–30 s leads to a stronger decomposition of the MMA into its fragments (especially at higher temperatures) than in other studies, which can be well modeled with a single first-order decomposition mechanism. A detailed analysis of captured condensate reveals a high purity of MMA, which enables the feedback into the polymerization process.","The study involves lab-scale flash pyrolysis of PMMA, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis via FTIR and condensate analysis."
"Cracking of plastic pyrolysis oil over FCC equilibrium catalysts to produce fuels: Kinetic modeling The kinetics of the catalytic cracking of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) over three FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) equilibrium commercial catalysts has been modeled. The PPO comes from the fast pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The cracking runs have been carried out in a laboratory-scale reactor under FCC conditions: 500–560 °C; catalyst/oil weight ratio of 5 gcat gPPO -1; and contact time of 1.5–6 s. Four different reaction schemes composed of six lumps have been compared and it has been obtained by statistical means that the simplest one is the most appropriate for describing the process. The differences in the kinetic parameters have been related to the properties of the catalysts. Among them, total acidity and mesoporous structure have a key role. The former for promoting the cracking reactions and the latter for limiting the diffusional restrictions of both the bulky compounds within the PPO and the formed coke precursors. This way, ECAT-3 that is the most acid and most mesoporous catalyst, maximizes the yields of naphtha (33.6 wt%) and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) (18.9 wt%). In contrast, ECAT-1 and ECAT-2 should be chosen for producing light cycle oil (LCO). For ECAT-3, the apparent activation energies of the conversion of heavy cycle oil (HCO) into light cycle oil (LCO), LCO into naphtha, and LCO into LPG are 60.5 42.5 and 58.3 kJ mol-1, respectively. In addition, those of the formation of coke from HCO, LPG and dry gas are 129.0, 4.4 and 40.7 kJ mol-1, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) to produce plastic pyrolysis oil, with measurable yields, reactor conditions, catalyst performance, and kinetic parameters analyzed."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene over various solid acid catalysts The catalytic pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene (Br-HIPS) was performed in the presence of five different solid acid catalysts in order to remove the bromine from the derived pyrolysis oil. The catalysts were three zeolite materials (HY, Hβ and HZSM-5) and two mesoporous solids (all-silica MCM-41 and active Al2O3). The results showed that in the presence of HY and Hβ zeolites, a reduction of approximate 50wt.% in oil yield and a corresponding increase in wax and gas yields were obtained compared to thermal degradation. The addition of HZSM-5 showed less impact on product distribution and produced more oil compared with the other zeolites. The mesoporous catalyst of all-silica MCM-41 obtained the highest oil yield of 67.9wt.% and reduced the wax yield to 8.73wt.%. In terms of the composition of the pyrolysis oil, HZSM-5 and all-silica MCM-41 were favorable to produce more valuable single ring aromatics, such as toluene, ethylbenzene and cumene. Moreover, the catalysts exhibited pronounced debromination performance, especially the Hβ catalyst, achieving the debromination efficiency of 70.47%. The results confirmed the catalytic pyrolysis of Br-HIPS and debromination performance was well related to the textural properties of catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of flame-retarded high impact polystyrene (Br-HIPS), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Recycling of low-density polyethylene and polypropylene via copyrolysis of polyalkene oil/waxes with naphtha: product distribution and coke formation The thermal decomposition of polyalkenes was investigated as a recycling route for the production of petrochemical feedstock. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were thermally decomposed individually in a batch reactor at 450°C, thus forming oil/wax products. Then these products were dissolved in primary heavy naphtha to obtain steam cracking feedstock. The selectivity and kinetics of copyrolysis for 10mass% solutions of oil/waxes from LDPE or PP with naphtha in the temperature range from 740 to 820°C at residence times from 0.09 to 0.54s were studied. The decomposition of polyalkene oil/waxes during copyrolysis was confirmed. It was shown that the yields of the desired alkenes (ethene, propene), according to polymer type, increased or only slightly decreased compared to the yields from naphtha. In addition to the primary reactions, the secondary reactions leading to coke formation have also been studied. The formation of coke during copyrolysis of LDPE wax with naphtha was comparable to the coking of pure naphtha. Slightly higher formation of coke was obtained at PP wax solution at the beginning of the measurements, on the clean surface of the reactor. After a thin layer of coke covered the walls, the production was the same as that from naphtha. The results confirm the possibility of polyalkenes recycling via the copyrolysis of polyalkene oils and waxes with conventional liquid steam cracking feedstocks on already existing industrial ethylene units.","The study involves lab-scale thermal decomposition of waste plastics (LDPE and PP) in a batch reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analysis of coke formation during copyrolysis with naphtha."
"Catalytic cracking of heavy fractions from the pyrolysis of waste HDPE and PP In the present paper, automotive waste plastics were considered as a potential source of fuels and chemicals. The feedstock in the experimental tests was represented by the heaviest fractions from the distillation of pyro-oil from the pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE-wax) and polypropylene (PP-wax). Due to their very high viscosity both polymer-waxes were, prior to processing, diluted in atmospheric gas oil (GO). Mixtures with hydrotreated vacuum gas oil (HVGO) were also prepared and processed under simulated fluid catalytic cracking conditions via a MAT-test. The product distribution was similar to the one shown by the commercial FCC process: light gases (C1, C2), LPG, gasoline fraction, light and heavy cycle oil. To maintain optimal performance a commercial FCC equilibrium catalyst (FCC-ECAT) was used. When processing HDPE and PP waxes, high yields of profiling products – propylene and gasoline were obtained. In the case of the PP-wax feed without HVGO, the yield of gasoline was even higher than in case of pure HVGO. When cracking HDPE-wax feed mixtures the product distribution was oriented more towards the production of propylene. The composition of liquid products considering all types of feedstock consisted mainly of iso-alkanes and aromatics. The calculated values of microactivity for the HDPE-wax and PP-wax feedstock, with or without HVGO, were significantly higher than in the case of pure HVGO.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic cracking of pyrolysis-derived HDPE and PP waxes, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Inhibitory and synergistic effects on thermal behaviour and char characteristics during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and single-use plastics The co-pyrolytic behaviour of single-use plastics (Polystyrene, Low-density polyethylene) and Eucalyptus biomass was investigated at variable temperatures (300, 400, 500, and 600 °C) and the effects of their interactions on the characteristics of solid chars were also studied. The variation in thermal profiles of ‘Δ Mass loss%’ showed the inhibitory and synergistic effects of plastics on the biomass degradation, resulting in higher and lower yields of char composite, respectively. The blend containing polystyrene exhibited the highest synergistic (Δ M ≈ 15.1) and inhibitory (Δ M ≈ - 4) effects. The thermal kinetics of blends also indicated the presence of both the effects through relatively higher and lower apparent activation energies compared to the calculated, before and during the degradation of plastics. Despite low fixed carbon contents and high volatile matter, polymer-coated char composites had higher fuel value indices (36–136%), energy yields (1–26%) and calorific values (15–21%), relative to biochar. After the complete degradation of plastics, char composites exhibited higher values of electrical conductivity (2–40%), surface area (15–64%), and cation exchange capacity (5–19%). These properties advocate the flexibility of char composites' applicability as solid fuel or soil amender depending on the optimized conditions of co-pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (polystyrene, LDPE) and biomass at defined temperatures with measurable product yields, thermal behavior, and char characteristics analysis."
"Six-lump kinetic model for plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) and vacuum gasoil (VGO) blend hydroprocessing considering selective catalyst deactivation A six-lump kinetic model has been developed for the hydroprocessing of a mixture of vacuum gas oil (VGO) and plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) in a ratio of 90:10 wt%, using a NiW/HY catalyst. This process aims to valorize waste plastics by producing valuable oil fractions such as naphtha and light cycle oil (LCO). The experiments were conducted in a semi-continuous stirred tank reactor across a temperature range of 370–440 °C and under 80 bar hydrogen pressure. Special attention was given on developing models to quantify the deactivation effects caused by coke and metal (Fe) deposition, with the latter having a lesser impact. These models are based on experimentally validated mechanisms of these phenomena, investigated through different post-mortem characterization techniques applied to spent catalysts. The successful fit of a separable deactivation model –featuring different deactivation functions for each reaction lump and an activity function related to the coke content– highlights the significant impact of pore blocking due to coke deposition. This blocking selectively affects the diffusion of molecules within the different lumps, depending on their volume. The results indicate that increasing the temperature has a favorable effect on the yield of naphtha and LCO fractions. At 440 °C and 180 min, the yield of these lumps exceeds 70 wt%, with a conversion greater than 75 %. Notably, at this elevated temperature, the hydrocracking of coke components becomes more favorable mitigating the deactivation caused by coke deposition.","The study involves lab-scale experimental hydroprocessing of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) derived from waste plastics, with measurable yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of catalyst deactivation."
"Evaluation of the applicability of polymeric materials to BTEX and fine product transformation by catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis as a part of the closed loop material economy This article presents experimental results on the pyrolysis of different mixtures of polymer waste. ABS copolymer, PET, PP, tire waste styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and pure non-vulcanised SBR were used in the experiments under different catalyst conditions: (i) without a catalyst, (ii) with an unmodified ZSM-5 catalyst, (iii) with a ZSM-5 catalyst possessing ammonium groups, and (iv) with a ZSM-5 catalyst containing 10 % Ni. The primary objective of this study was to select suitable conditions to pyrolyse polymeric materials depending on the polymer type and properties of the desired final products, e.g., aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons and valuable chemical subproducts. Suitable conditions can be determined for the thermal conversion of polymeric materials, and using non-catalytic pyrolysis can yield chemical compounds such as alpha-methyl styrene from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and limonene from tire waste, which can be used in both fine chemicals and industrial production. The pyrolysis conditions can be modified in terms of the catalyst based on the tested waste polymer and result in products rich in BTEX fractions. Among all tested catalysts, the ZSM-5 catalyst based on aluminosilicate impregnated with nickel ions yielded the highest total fraction of aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons, especially from the pyrolysis of PP and PET. With this catalyst, more than 75 area% of the product stream (of the total identified product peaks by MS) consisted of aromatic and heteroaromatic fractions (e.g., terephthalonitrile from polyethylene terephthalate), which were composed of 5.6 and 19.9 area% benzene, 7.0 and 10.8 area% toluene, 5.7 and 10.6 area% ethylbenzene and 1.2 and 1.4 area% xylene for PP and PET, respectively. High proportions of the aromatic and heteroaromatic fractions were observed in the product stream during the ABS pyrolysis with two types of catalysts: aluminosilicate with ammonium groups (73 area% of the aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons) and aluminosilicate impregnated with nickel ions (85 area% of the aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons).","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (ABS, PET, PP, SBR) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis via GC–MS."
"Investigation of hydrocarbon fractions form waste plastic recycling by FTIR, GC, EDXRFS and SEC techniques Waste high-density polyethylene was converted into different hydrocarbon fractions by thermal and thermo-catalytic batch cracking. For the catalytic degradation of waste plastics three different catalysts (equilibrium FCC, HZSM-5 and clinoptilolite) were used. Catalysts differ basically in their costs and activity due to the differences of micro- and macroporous surface areas and furthermore the Si/Al ratio and acidities are also different. Mild pyrolysis was used at 430 °C and the reaction time was 45 min in each case. The composition of products was defined by gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and other standardized methods. The effects of catalysts on the properties of degradation products were investigated. Both FCC and clinoptilolite catalysts had considerably catalytic activity to produce light hydrocarbon liquids, while HZSM-5 catalyst produced the highest amount of gaseous products. In case of liquids, carbon numbers were distributed within the C5–C23 range depending on the cracking parameters. Decomposition of the carbon chain could be followed by GC and both by FTIR and SEC techniques in case of volatile fractions and residues. Catalysts increased yields of valuable volatile fractions and moreover catalysts caused both carbon chain isomerization and switching of the position of double bonds.","The study involves lab-scale thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of waste high-density polyethylene with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization using GC, FTIR, SEC, and EDXRFS."
"Unraveling the hydrocracking capabilities of fluidized bed systems operated with natural ores as bed materials Hydrocracking represents an alternative to the recycling of abundantly available plastic waste. Hydrocracking of polyethylene in a fluidized bed, at 750 °C and 1 atm, was investigated in this work. Water dissociation, through the steam-iron reaction, was used as the source of hydrogen. Bauxite and olivine, containing reduced iron, were used as the bed materials in the reactor to drive the water dissociation reaction. The hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratios of the products were compared to assess the hydrocracking potential. It was discovered that conversion of polyethylene on the surface of reduced bauxite effectively increased the H/C ratios of the products, as compared to bauxite in its oxidized form. Reduced olivine was ineffective at increasing the H/C ratios of the products in the presence of water dissociation. It is concluded that hydrocracking through hydrogen donation by steam is feasible in fluidized beds, provided that the bed material has the ability to transfer the hydrogen atoms to the hydrocarbon species.",The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product H/C ratios and catalyst performance analysis.
"Coupling of chemical deconstruction and pyrolysis to upcycle metallized multilayer plastic films Multilayer metallized plastic films are popular packaging materials that are not currently recycled due to their complex multi-material make-up. In this study, a sequential pathway combining chemical, thermal and biological techniques was introduced to recycle military multilayer packaging made up of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polyethylene (PE), and aluminum. Chemical deconstruction using 10 wt% aqueous ammonia was able to selectively depolymerize the PET layer at a conversion close to 100 %. Aluminum and other metals were not detected in the deconstructed PET product, which contained Terephthalic Acid (TPA), terephthalic acid monoamide, terephthalamide, and ethylene glycol monomers that serve as the substrate for biological conversion. A natural microbial community was able to grow on the deconstructed multilayer at monomer concentrations of 5 g/L, producing a single cell protein product that could be used for food or animal feeds. The polyethylene and aluminum layers, which are inert during chemical deconstruction, were then pyrolyzed to breakdown the residual polyethylene into oil and wax hydrocarbons, leaving the aluminum unreacted. Elemental and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses confirmed that the chemical deconstruction pretreatment step significantly improved the pyrolysis product quality by removing oxygen. The presented proof-of-concept technology represents an intriguing method to control contamination when processing complex waste plastic.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polyethylene from multilayer plastic films, with measured product yields and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"A composite obtained from waste automotive plastics and sugarcane skin flour: Mechanical properties and thermo-chemical analysis In this study, wood plastic composites (WPC) were made using waste automobile bumpers (WAB) and sugarcane skin flour (SSF) as matrix and fibres, respectively. A novel KH550/TCA201 composite coupling agent was applied to modify the composites. Then, the composites were analysed by FTIR, TG-MS, GC-MS and SEM-EDS after being pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyser and a tubular fixed bed. The results show that the mechanical strength of the composite modified by the KH550/TCA201 composite coupling agent is higher than that of the composite modified by a single coupling agent. When KH550/TCA201 is 2% with KH550:TCA201 = 1:1, the tensile, flexural and impact strength of the WPC composites reaches a maximum. In the pyrolysis of WPC, a large amount of alkanes, olefins, aromatics and a small amount of CO2 were produced from 380 °C to 500 °C. During the WPC pyrolysis process, the release of HF and HBr is higher than that of WAB, whereas the release of HCl is less than that of WAB. In the pyrolysis oil, the main fluoride production occurs at 400–600 °C and reaches a maximum at 500 °C. Meanwhile, in the fast pyrolysis oil, the content of organic fluoride is 6 times higher compared with the slow pyrolysis oil. For the solid residue, the content of F, Cl, Br and other pollutants increased with an increase in temperature. Specifically, the chlorine content was higher at slow pyrolysis than at fast pyrolysis. Therefore, from a controllable and environmental standpoint, slow pyrolysis should be adopted in order to increase the content of the contaminated halogen elements in the solid residue.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste automotive plastics (WAB) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization of pyrolysis products using GC-MS, TG-MS, and FTIR."
"Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and metal-free/metal-loaded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics improved biochar properties and reduced environmental risk of heavy metals Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and plastics have been utilized for producing biochars as a strategy to fix plastic pollution. However, comparative studies on the characteristics and environmental risk of heavy metals in biochars obtained by the co-pyrolysis of sludge and microplastic with/without metal additives are seldom. Here we demonstrated the effects of simulated co-pyrolysis (at 400 °C) of sewage sludge and metal-free or metal-loaded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics at different mass ratios (1:0, 19:1, 3:1, 1:3, sewage sludge: PVC (w/w)) respectively. Results revealed that co-pyrolysis of metal-loaded PVC and sewage sludge resulted in higher electrical conductivity, ash content, and an acidic pH of biochars as compared to the co-pyrolysis of metal-free PVC and sewage sludge. Addition of metal-loaded PVC increased total concentrations of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in biochars, but reduced the bioavailability of Cd, chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in biochars. Analysis of chemical speciation showed that heavy metals (except Pb) in biochars derived from co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and metal-loaded PVC had higher percentage of more stable fraction (residual fraction) and lower potential ecological risk index (RI) value. S1AP3 (sludge: metal-loaded PVC = 1:3) biochar had the lowest environmental risk based on RI value (14.41). To sum up the present study suggests that the addition of metal-loaded PVC microplastic in sewage sludge had a positive impact on the immobilization of heavy metals during co-pyrolysis process.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of metal-loaded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics with sewage sludge, reporting measurable product properties (biochar characteristics, heavy metal speciation, environmental risk index) and reactor conditions (400 °C, mass ratios)."
"Synergistic interactions, kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of co-pyrolysis of municipal paper and polypropylene waste Co-pyrolyzing mixed wastes of the different physicochemical kinds is often a challenge. This study reports the co-pyrolysis of homogeneous polypropylene plastic and paper wastes, highlighting their characteristics, synergetic effects, and kinetic and thermodynamic parameters using robust thermal gravimetric analysis technique. Results show that 20% paper in the blend improved the bulky density, fuel ratio from 0.09 to 0.13, maximum degradation temperature from 369.55 to 447.88 °C and thermal stability from 381.60 to 393.82 °C. The average activation energies of the blend from Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, Friedman and Coats-Redfern were 148.73 ± 7.87, 133.98 ± 11.59 and 143.74 ± 13.83 kJ/mol, respectively, lower than at least one of the homogenous wastes. All the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy values were positive, thus, endothermic non-spontaneous pyrolysis. In addition, average enthalpies for the mixed sample were lower than homogeneous polypropylene (from 159.57 ± 11.86, 153.74 ± 16.07 and 181.27 ± 28.90 to 143.60 ± 24.42, 128.86 ± 34.61 and 138.61 ± 41.32 kJ/mol, respectively) in all models, respectively. The entropy values for all samples were negative. They decreased with increasing conversion rates for mixed waste samples, indicating ease to reach thermodynamic equilibrium during pyrolysis. There is an insignificant difference between the experimental and the calculated TGA/DTG curves, signifying meagre synergetic effects. In addition, the 3D surface response for the conversion rate against temperature and heating rate showed closeness in results between the homogeneous and mixed waste. The results of this study are vital in handling municipal solid waste without any need for isolation during the conversion process to valuable products.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene waste and paper, with measurable product yields, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, and analytical characterization using TGA and DTG."
"Co-pyrolysis of waste wind turbine blades in a molten polyolefin medium This study investigates the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes of waste wind turbine blades (WWTB) and polyolefins (POs) at 450 °C in a round bottom tank reactor. The study contains three experimental sets: 1) batch pyrolysis of POs; 2) continuous pyrolysis of WWTB; 3) continuous feeding of WWTB into a molten PO medium, which was previously fed to the round bottom tank reactor batch-wise. Individual WWTB pyrolysis yields a modest 18.7 wt% of liquid, predominantly influenced by elevated ash and fixed carbon content. Conversely, co-pyrolysis demonstrates positive synergies, with escalating polyolefin content boosting liquid yields, reaching a peak at 61.5 wt% with a WWTB:POs mixture (25:75, wt%), while concurrently suppressing gas production to 21.6 wt%. The primary chemical groups found in the liquid obtained from WWTB are phenol and phenolic compounds, with their abundance diminishing as the POs ratio in feedstocks increases. Analysis of non-condensable gases from WWTB reveals that approximately 57.7 wt% are oxygen-containing, predominantly CO and CO2. Co-pyrolysis with POs at a 25:75 (wt%) ratio yields 47.1 wt% C3H6, resembling POs pyrolysis. The resulting solid products are rich in carbon and contains high ash. This research not only offers a detailed product analysis of WWTB but also sheds light on the dynamics of its co-pyrolysis with POs. Doing so contributes crucial insights into the transformative potential of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis processes, covering the way for sustainable waste-to-resource solutions.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (polyolefins) and waste wind turbine blades containing plastic composites, with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization."
"Depolymerization of polystyrene at reduced pressure through a microwave assisted pyrolysis Large amounts of styrene and other important aromatic hydrocarbons were obtained employing microwave assisted pyrolysis for the depolymerization of polystyrene in the presence of carbon as an absorber. Working at a reduced pressure the yield of liquid was increased (higher than 75%) with respect to those obtained at ambient pressure. This liquid was clear and showed a low viscosity and density. On the contrary a dark brown liquid was formed when pyrolysis was carried out in a stream of nitrogen, but the yield was 94.3wt%. Using a fractionating system and a residual pressure of 21.3kPa the maximum concentration of styrene in the liquid was reached (71.9wt%) corresponding to the maximum amount of styrene recovered from the starting PS (60.6wt%). The substitution of carbon with silicon carbide as MW absorber, gave almost the same amount of liquid but the rate of pyrolysis was strongly reduced. Composition of liquids was affected by residence time into the reactor and some different compounds might be obtained by reaction among intermediates formed in the course of the process. Reverse polymerization of PS through microwave assisted pyrolysis may be a way to solve some environmental problems caused by waste PS. Large amount of valuable chemicals such as styrene, α-methylstyrene and toluene was collected while gas and char, formed in low amount, may be used as fuel.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polystyrene, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Pyrolysis and catalytic reforming of ABS/PC and PCB using biochar and e-waste char as alternative green catalysts for oil and metal recovery This paper studied pyrolysis and catalytic reforming processes of ABS/PC and PCB as representatives of e-waste for possibility of energy and metal recovery. Y-Zeolite (YZ), ZSM-5, biochar (BC), electronic waste char (EWC), iron oxide loaded YZ (Fe/YZ), Fe/ZSM-5, Fe/BC and Fe/EWC were used as catalysts. Pyrolysis and catalytic reforming were performed at 500 °C. Results showed that the ABS/PC had high yield of oil (40–75%) whereas PCB showed limit amount of oil yield (lower than 8%). Catalysts increased single-ring hydrocarbon products in pyrolysis oil of both ABS/PC and PCB. Iron oxide originally in BC and EWC had the debromination effect during catalytic reforming process. Maximum debromination performance for ABS/PC and PCB feedstock was 91% (Fe/BC) and 68% (Fe/EWC), respectively. Metal compound in char was significantly high in case of PCB (16.025 wt%) and relatively low from ABS/PC (1.141 wt%). This research showed that using renewable catalyst precursors such as biochar or char from e-waste itself during pyrolysis and catalytic reforming was a promising method to recover low-bromine oil and metal. This could save cost on catalyst and increase possibility for implementation.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (ABS/PC) and PCB using catalysts, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst performance data."
"Co-pyrolysis characteristics of typical components of waste plastics in a falling film pyrolysis reactor Waste plastics mainly come from MSW and usually exist in the form of mixed plastics. During the co-pyrolysis process of mixed plastics, various plastic components have different physicochemical properties and reaction mechanisms. Considering the high viscosity and low thermal conductivity of molten plastics, a falling film pyrolysis reactor was selected to explore the rapid co-pyrolysis process of typical plastic components (PP, PE and PS). The oil and gas yields and the compositions of pyrolysis products of the three components under different ratios at pyrolysis temperatures were analyzed to explore the co-pyrolysis characteristics of PP, PE, and PS.

"Catalytic degradation of expandable polystyrene waste (EPSW) over mordenite and modified mordenites The performance of the several different modified mordenite zeolites in the degradation of expandable polystyrene waste (EPSW) was investigated in this study. The composition of the degradation products, especially the liquid fraction was compared to understand the role of H-mordenite and the effect of its modification through framework dealumination and metal impregnation. The degradation was carried out in a batch reactor at 360 and 400°C. The dealuminated mordenite with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 86 showed enhanced styrene/styrene dimer and styrene/ethylbenzene molar ratios at lower (360°C) and higher (400°C) temperature, respectively. This was attributed to the intermediate acid strength distribution generated on removal of framework aluminum by acid leaching. Modification of H-mordenite by metal impregnation substantially changed the acidic and catalytic properties in polystyrene degradation. The 0.64wt.% phosphorous loading on H-mordenite showed improved EPSW conversion, styrene yield and SM/EB molar ratio at 400°C. The 0.32wt.% phosphorous loading facilitated the improvement in SM/EB molar ratio with higher styrene selectivity than thermal degradation at 360°C.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of expandable polystyrene waste in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Three-stage pyrolysis-catalytic dry reforming of waste polyolefins over MFI and Ni-MFI catalysts for BTEX and syngas production This work presents an experimental proof-of-concept study for a three-stage pyrolysis-catalytic dry reforming process for recovering valuable chemicals from waste plastics. It is demonstrated that depending upon the catalysts, process parameters and reactor configuration, plastic waste and carbon dioxide can be converted into a diverse array of valuable chemicals which can be used as secondary feedstocks in the chemical or petrochemical industry, thus decreasing dependency on fossil resources and contributing to waste reduction. For this work, waste polypropylene was thermally pyrolyzed and the emerging vapors were passed over HZSM-5 catalyst to obtain BTEX-rich pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gases containing mainly C1 to C4 hydrocarbons. The gaseous products were separated, mixed with CO2 and passed over Ni-silicalite-1 catalyst to obtain syngas, thus upgrading the pyrolysis gases and contributing to CO2 reduction.

While several kinetic studies have examined the cracking of waste plastic, they are often oversimplified or inappropriate for designing an industrial reactor. This work proves the necessity of using isoconversional methods by using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC verified that cracking of waste plastic involves the production of several intermediates, indicating that the kinetics is more complex and requires further studies. Several isoconversional methods such as Friedman, Ozawa, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and model-free were applied to estimate the apparent activation energy and frequency factor of thermal cracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using nonisothermal and isothermal Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The determined kinetic parameters from each method were evaluated against the experimental data. As none of these methods were found to have an acceptable agreement with the experimental data, a new isothermal isoconversional model was proposed and good matching results was were observed.","The study involves thermal cracking of waste HDPE, a commercial plastic, using TGA and DSC with measurable kinetic parameters and experimental data."
"Low-density polyethylene-derived carbon nanotubes from express packaging bags waste as electrode material for supercapacitors A simple and efficient method for disposing of waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) express packaging bags is proposed in this paper as a way to minimize waste and address the energy shortage at the same time. In addition to following the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) derived from LDPE, the application of CNTs as electrodes for supercapacitors was attempted. Waste LDPE bags were pyrolyzed and carbonized with catalyst using a dual-temperature reaction system, a designed 450 °C pyrolysis temperature accompany with different carbonization temperatures (650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, 800 °C, 850 °C), and treatment durations (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h) were investigated. As determined by FE-SEM and FE-TEM, the CNTs synthesized at 750 °C showed a finer tube diameter, much more uniform distribution, bamboo-like structure, as well as the highest yield of 41.9 %, and carbon conversion of 61.2 %. As being charged and discharged 10,000 times, the electrode remained a 93.16 % capacitance and a 92.85 % Coulomb efficiency. A dual-temperature reaction system could be utilized to recycle waste LDPE efficiently, and the LDPE-derived CNTs could be applied for supercapacitors.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste low-density polyethylene (LDPE) packaging bags with measurable yields, temperature-dependent product analysis, and characterization of carbon nanotubes using FE-SEM and FE-TEM."
"Autocatalytic influence of different levels of arsine on the thermal stability and pyrolysis of polypropylene In this article, the pyrolysis and thermo-degradation of 11 virgin-polypropylene (virgin-PP) with different levels of arsenic in its polymer matrix, was carried out in a discontinuous quartz reactor at 500 °C. To quantify arsine (AsH3), 4 points were sampled during the PP synthesis process and a methodology was applied by GC with 4 detectors, which simultaneously and with a single injection allowed to quantify multiple components. AsH3 in propylene varied between 0.05 and 4.73 ppm and arsenic in virgin-PP residues between 0.001 and 4.32 ppm for PP0 and PP10. These generated an increase in the melt flow index from 3.0 to 24.51 and maintained a direct relationship with an R2 of 0.9993. The origin of thermo-oxidative degradation and the beginnings of virgin-PP pyrolysis are explained by the formation to aldehyde, ketone, alcohol, carboxylic acid functional groups, CO and CO2. These species caused TG and DTG curves to have atypical behavior for PP. For example, PP10 with an arsenic content of 4.32 ppm presented 3 degradation peaks at 80, 90 and 200 °C with a mass loss ratio of 22%, 18% and 55% °C−1 respectively. During pyrolysis the highest percentage of alkanes was found in PP0 with an average value of 62.4%, and the lowest values were found in PP8 to PP10, with oscillations between 0% and 1.4%. The total concentration of oxidized species for PP0 to PP10 was 2.26%, 32.7%, 43.1%, 50.9%, 59.3%, 66.2%, 75.0%, 83.0%, 89.1% and 97.5% respectively. In an O2 atmosphere ketones and carboxylic acids were only identified in PP0 to PP5. CO2 concentrations in PP5 to PP10 were of 100%.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of virgin polypropylene with varying arsenic levels, including measured product yields, temperature-dependent degradation behavior, and detailed analytical characterization of pyrolysis products."
"Improving bio-oil quality from low-density polyethylene pyrolysis: Effects of varying activation and pyrolysis parameters Activated carbons have recently emerged as renewable and efficient catalysts in converting low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable chemical and fuels, while the effects of various structure characters and operating conditions on the catalytic reactions of LDPE have not been well interpreted. Here, the renewable Chestnut shell is used to produce catalyst (CNSACC), then applied in catalytic pyrolysis process for the first time to conclude fatidic perception in the optimal process in improving jet fuel range aromatics and H2-enriched fuel gas. Activating reagent concentration and carbonization temperature play critical roles in the specific surface area and acidity, having optima conditions in obtaining target chemicals due to unique inherent structure of parent CNS. The catalytic temperature and catalyst loading also give rise to different catalytic performance. The results showed that the main compositions of attained bio-oil are belonged to jet fuel range hydrocarbons (up to 100%). The optimal selectivity of aromatics (95.88%) with a high content of H2 (65.37 vol%) could be achieved at a H3PO4/CNS ratio of 0.8, carbonization temperature of 850 °C, catalytic temperature of 550 °C and CNSACC/LDPE ratio of 1.0. This may provide fresh insight into fabricating catalyst from biomass, and give suggestions to upgradation of pyrolysis products.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed experimental conditions including temperature, catalyst ratios, and product composition analysis."
"Chitosan-assisted reassembled hierarchical HZSM-5 for selective production of monocyclic aromatics in catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic Biomass presents significant potential as an alternative template agent for assisting zeolites in developing new pore structure during recrystallization to enhance their catalytic performance. In this study, a new hierarchical HZSM-5 was synthesized through the in-situ reassembly of alkali-treated HZSM-5 with chitosan as an assisting agent. The impact of chitosan dosage on the catalytic performance of the hierarchical HZSM-5, as well as the influences of temperature, catalyst dosage, and corn stover (CS) to high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mass ratio on the content and selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) during the catalytic co-pyrolysis process, were thoroughly investigated. The results indicated that chitosan exhibited great potential as a template in the reassembly of hierarchical HZSM-5 during NaOH treatment, promoting the formation of weak acid sites and micro-mesoporous structures. Compared to the parent HZSM-5, the chitosan-assistant reassembled hierarchical HZSM-5 significantly enhanced the production of MAHs and inhibited the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The highest carbon yield of MAHs reached 36.9 % at 550 °C with a chitosan dosage of 15 %. Furthermore, the chitosan-modified HZSM-5 notably enhanced the synergistic production of MAHs by 38.2 %, while preventing the formation of PAHs and coke. This study contributes insights into the sustainable synthesis of hierarchical HZSM-5 for improved production of high-value products in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (HDPE) with biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Chemical recycling of crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate) and characterization of polymers produced with the recycled monomer The chemical recycling of crosslinked poly(methyl methacrylate) wastes, PMMA, used as dental resins, was investigated for recovery and polymerization of the methyl methacrylate monomer, MMA. At temperatures of 400 °C in laboratory and pilot plant installations, PMMA could be depolymerized by pyrolysis to produce more than 90 wt% of liquid, containing more than 98 wt% of MMA. Gas chromatography (GC) and coupled gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses were carried out to characterize the obtained liquid fraction. PMMA powders produced with different quantities of recycled MMA were prepared, after purification of the liquid through distillation, leading to polymer resins with properties that were similar to the ones obtained with virgin commercial MMA, as characterized by particle size, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste crosslinked PMMA, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, product composition analysis via GC–MS, and characterization of resulting polymers."
"Depolymerization-liquefaction of plastics and rubbers. 2. Polystyrenes and styrene-butadiene copolymers The depolymerization-liquefaction reactions of representative polystyrene and styrene-butadiene co-polymer (non-vulcanized SBR) samples were systematically investigated as a function of processing variables, i.e. temperature (350–450°C), time (15–120 min), H2 pressure (500–2500 psig), and the presence of catalysts. Two solid superacids, i.e. Fe2O3 SO4 2− and ZrO2 SO4 2− , which differ in acidity were used in the study. The detailed composition of products was determined by GC/MS. Typical products from a polystyrene sample (average MW, 280 000) contained benzene, toluene, (C2C5) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, 1,3-diphenylalkanes and triphenylalkanes, accompanied by some indanes, tetralins, naphthalenes and polyphenyls, whereas products from non-vulcanized SBR (MW, 140 000) contained, in addition to the above, C5C9 paraffins and cycloparaffins, (C5C8) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, cyclopentylbenzenes, and cyclohexylbenzenes. The changes in product composition as a function of the above processing variables were determined and conditions for preferential (> 85 wt.%) production of gasoline-range liquid fuels established. The observed change in composition as a function of reaction time and temperature allowed for elucidation of mechanistic aspects of high-temperature depolymerization-liquefaction processes, including the role of catalytic effects.","The study involves pyrolysis of polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymer (plastics) under controlled lab-scale conditions with measurable product yields, composition analysis via GC/MS, and temperature–yield relationships."
"Isocyanate emissions from pyrolysis of mattresses containing polyurethane foam This study examined the emissions of powerful asthmatic agents called isocyanates from small-scale pyrolysis experiments of two common foams employed in mattress production such as flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) and viscoelastic memory foam (VMF). A nitrogen atmosphere and five different temperatures, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 850 °C, were selected to carry out the experiments in order to evaluate the worst possible conditions for thermal degradation. A similar trend for both materials was found. At lower temperatures, diisocyanates were the most important products whereas at 850 °C monoisocyanates, and mainly isocyanic acid released mainly from the thermal cracking of diisocyanates evolved directly from the polymer chains. The total yields of isocyanates were in the range of 1.43–11.95 mg/m3 for FPUF at 300-850 °C and 0.05–6.13 mg/m3 for VMF, 300-850 °C. This difference could be a consequence of the lower amount of isocyanates employed in the VMF production which was confirmed by the nitrogen content of the foams, 5.95% FPUF vs. 3.34% in VMF. Additionally, a qualitative search for so far unknown isocyanates was performed in samples from the pyrolysis of FPUF at 300, 400 and 850 °C. It was confirmed that six different aminoisocyanates at 300 °C were evolved, whereas at 400 and 850 °C only five of them were detected. The general trend observed was a decrease of the aminoisocyanate levels with increasing pyrolysis temperature.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyurethane foams (FPUF and VMF), a type of plastic, with measured isocyanate yields and temperature-dependent product analysis."
"Gasoline-range hydrocarbons produced from microwave-induced pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene over ZSM-5 The microwave-induced pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (a model of waste plastics) toward its conversion into biofuels was investigated using ZSM-5 as a catalyst, generating significant amounts of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. A central composite experimental design (CCD) was done to investigate the effects of catalytic temperature and reactant to catalyst ratio on the pyrolysis-oils composition and to achieve the maximum liquid yield. The optimized condition for maximizing the yield of upgraded oil (32.58wt.%) was at 450°C and reactant to catalyst ratio of 2. GC–MS analysis showed that mono-ring aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched and became the most abundant compounds which varied from 74.73% to 88.49% in upgraded pyrolysis-oils, depending on the catalytic pyrolysis conditions. Both low temperature and high reactant to catalyst ratio gave rise to the formation of less desirable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons whereas high temperature and high ratio contributed to mono-ring aromatic hydrocarbons. The primary reaction competing with aromatic hydrocarbon production was the formation of coke which was negligible even at low catalytic temperatures. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed in order to shed light on the overall catalytic microwave pyrolysis of LDPE for aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-induced pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (a waste plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis via GC–MS."
"Enhancing mass transfer efficiency via “Burger” co-pyrolysis of plastics and three biomass components Enhancing the target product yields from co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass relies on the synergetic interaction of their intermediate products. Therefore, a key factor in strengthening this synergy is increasing the yield of both feedstocks’ intermediate products. The study innovatively utilizes the “Burger” layered filling strategy to alter the mass transfer process and affect the yield of key intermediate products. In the traditional homogenous blending mode, the plastic will first melt and encapsulate biomass during the heating process to block the mass transfer process, thus limiting their interaction. However, the “Burger” layered method mitigates mass transfer constraints and has a positive impact on increasing the relative content of key intermediates and aromatic hydrocarbons. For instance, compared to the homogeneous blending pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and lignin, the layered pyrolysis increased the relative content of phenolic compounds, which are key intermediates during lignin pyrolysis, from 9.02 % to 13.49 %. In the co-pyrolysis of polypropylene and hemicellulose, the layered pyrolysis increased the relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons from 8.59 % to 11.03 %. This investigation offers valuable insights into optimizing mass transfer in the co-pyrolysis process, aiming to advancing the overall efficiency of co-pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, PP) with biomass, demonstrating measurable product yield improvements and analytical characterization of intermediate products such as phenolic compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons."
"Co-pyrolysis performances, synergistic mechanisms, and products of textile dyeing sludge and medical plastic wastes This study aimed to quantify the co-pyrolysis of textile dyeing sludge (TDS) and the two medical plastic wastes of syringes (SY) and medical bottles (MB) in terms of their performances, synergistic mechanisms, and products. The pyrolysis of polyolefin plastics with its high calorific value and low ash content can offset the poor mono-pyrolytic performance of TDS. The synergistic mechanisms occurred mainly in the range of 400–550 °C. The addition of 10% SY or MB achieved the best co-pyrolysis performance with the lowest activation energy. The co-pyrolysis increased the contents of CH4 and CH but reduced CO2 emission. The co-pyrolysis released more fatty hydrocarbons, alcohols, and cyclic hydrocarbon during but reduced the yields of ethers and furans, through the synergistic mechanisms. The addition of the polyolefin plastics made the micro surface particles of chars smaller and looser. Our results can benefit energy utilization, pollution control, and optimal operational conditions for the industrial thermochemical conversions of hazardous wastes.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (medical syringes and bottles) and textile dyeing sludge, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent performance, and analytical characterization of products and char morphology."
"Hydrothermal decomposition of polyethylene waste to hydrocarbons rich oil In the present study the supercritical water (SCW) degradation of polyethylene (PE) plastics (virgin LDPE, PE waste) has been investigated in a batch reactor at 380–450 °C and reaction time of 15–240 min. The experiments (virgin LDPE) were also performed with the addition of acetic acid. During the SCW decomposition of PE plastics oil or wax, aqueous, gas and solid (only in PE waste) phases were formed. The obtained oil phase was composed of alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatics, and alcohols, while the gas phase manly contained light hydrocarbons (C1–C6). By performing reaction at high temperatures (425–450 °C) and reaction times from 30 to 240 min the concentrations of long-chain hydrocarbons (>C20) and C9–C20 (diesel) fraction in oil phase decreased, while concentration of C6–C8 hydrocarbons (gasoline fraction) increased. Finally, the influence of acetic acid on the PE degradation has been discussed and the potential degradation mechanism of PE waste in SCW is proposed.","The study involves lab-scale hydrothermal decomposition of waste polyethylene (PE) in a batch reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Impact of antioxidant addition on the thermal decomposition behavior of polyisoprene rubber during low-temperature pyrolysis The pyrolysis of used rubber is a promising approach for resource recovery; however, the selective recovery of isoprene remains a challenge due to extensive thermal decomposition and secondary reactions. This study proposes a co-pyrolysis process aimed at enhancing the retention of the isoprene skeleton in the recovered liquid rubber during low-temperature pyrolysis. A cross-linked polyisoprene rubber reinforced with carbon black was co-pyrolyzed with phenolic antioxidants, namely tetrakis[methylene(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]methane, denoted as AO-1010, and n-octadecyl-3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, denoted as AO-1076, to inhibit radical-induced structural degradation. The isoprene skeleton retention rate decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature for all samples. However, antioxidant-treated rubbers (AO-1010 and AO-1076) showed higher retention at 300 °C compared to untreated rubber, indicating that antioxidants can suppress thermal degradation and preserve the isoprene structure at elevated temperatures. For untreated rubber, the isoprene recovery rate increased from approximately 12 % at 200 °C to a peak of 53 % at 270 °C, followed by a sharp decline to 34 % at 300 °C, suggesting intensified secondary reactions at higher temperatures. In contrast, rubbers treated with antioxidants AO-1010 and AO-1076 exhibited improved stability at elevated temperatures. At 300 °C, the AO-1010- and AO-1076-treated rubbers maintained higher isoprene skeleton recovery rates of 50 % and 47 %, respectively. Additionally, antioxidant treatments significantly reduced the molecular weight of the rubber from Mw 340,000 to approximately 35,000 at 270 °C. These findings demonstrate that co-pyrolysis with antioxidants can better preserve the isoprene skeleton and increase liquid product yields at low temperatures. This approach offers a promising strategy for improving the efficiency and selectivity of isoprene recovery.","The study involves low-temperature pyrolysis of waste polyisoprene rubber, a commercial plastic material, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of molecular weight and isoprene skeleton retention."
"Sustainable production of carbon nanomaterials based on TPT backsheet pyrolysis from end-of-life photovoltaic modules The environmentally friendly recycling of end-of-life (EoL) photovoltaic modules is a crucial pathway to achieving “carbon neutrality.” However, currently, most efforts are primarily focused on the recovery of valuable metals, neglecting the utilization of TPT (Tedlar/PET/Tedlar) plastic backsheet. This work develops a two-stage pyrolysis process for TPT decomposition and which can convert into high-value nanocarbon materials and hydrogen under the catalysis of Ni and Fe nanometal particles. The pyrolysis behavior of TPT backplates was systematically investigated, the gas chromatography results reveal that the pyrolysis products primarily consisted of CO2, CO, CH4, CH3CHO, and other small molecules, alongside sizeable residual compounds under the catalytic degradation process. The resulting hydrocarbons play an important role as carbon sources in the formation of carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen generation. The study thoroughly discusses the effects of different catalyst on pyrolysis gas species and components, fixed carbon content, and nanocarbon morphology. Molecular dynamics simulations based on the reactive force field (ReaxFF) was performed to analyze the pyrolysis products. Finally, a gas–liquid-solid physical model was proposed to interpret the growth process of the carbon nanomaterials under Ni-Fe nanometallic catalysis.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of TPT plastic backsheet from end-of-life photovoltaic modules, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of pyrolysis products and nanocarbon materials."
"Thermal and catalytic cracking of a LDPE–EVA copolymer mixture Catalytic cracking of a plastic mixture consisting of LDPE and ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer (86/14 w/w) over mesoporous Al-SBA-15 and Al-MCM-41 materials as well as nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite (crystal size ∼35 nm) has been carried out in a batch reactor at 400–420°C. The release of acetic acid formed from the EVA decomposition was observed within the temperature range 350–400°C. The most active catalyst was nanometer size HZSM-5 that led to complete conversion of the plastic mixture at 420°C whereas both Al-MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15 were meaningfully less active. In addition, the polymer mixture was more difficult to be cracked both thermally and catalytically than pure LDPE. This result has been ascribed to the occurrence of cross-linking reactions leading to a fast deactivation by coke fouling especially over mesoporous catalysts (Al-MCM-41 and Al-SBA-15) because of their open structure. A high selectivity towards C1–C5 hydrocarbons (∼75%) was attained over nanometer size HZSM-5, most of them being valuable C3–C4 olefins. PIONA analyses of the C6–C12 hydrocarbon fraction obtained at 420°C indicates that olefins were the main components whereas a significant amount of aromatics was also obtained both thermally and catalytically (>15%).","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of a waste plastic mixture (LDPE–EVA) with measurable yields, temperature-dependent performance, catalyst comparisons, and product composition analysis using PIONA and GC–MS."
"Study on the reusability of kaolin as catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene The commonly used pyrolytic catalysts (molecular sieves, metals, etc.) are expensive and easily inactivated, which is a major difficulty in the catalytic pyrolysis technology. In this work, the effect of low-cost kaolin with different particle sizes on the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in fixed furnace and its reusability are studied. The results show that the liquid oil mainly contains aliphatics and aromatics. The carbon number of liquid oils is mainly in the range of C6-C20, accounting for 90%-95%. The first addition of 1250 mesh kaolin (K1250) produces the highest contents of aliphatics (64.66%) and hydrocarbons (93.91%) and H2 (30.07%). During the repeated use of K1250, the increasing trend of aromatics content was consistent with the results of particle size increase. The presence of carbon deposition after the use of the catalyst causes slight coking, which increases the acidity and particle size of the catalyst. K1250 is suitable for the production of liquid oil with better quality (more hydrocarbons, more aliphatic groups) and higher yield in the early stage of use. However, it is suitable to produce pyrolysis gas with high quality (more hydrogen and methane) and high yield in the later stage of reuse.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using kaolin catalysts, with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and catalyst reusability data."
"Wax co-cracking synergism of high density polyethylene to alternative fuels Attempts have been made to understand the thermal degradation of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and their combined co-cracking using different ratios of HDPE and petroleum wax under nitrogen atmosphere. We have conducted the experiments using HDPE as the raw material and petroleum wax as co-feed by at 400 and 450°C reaction temperatures. The product distribution was noted along with reaction time of 0.5–3h for the degradation. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) technique was used to measure the weight change of the feedstock as a function of temperature and time. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the degradation temperature. Products were characterized using gas chromatography (GC) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), some other standard physical methods were used to determine the main properties of the liquid products. Results show that the mixed plastic-wax samples could be converted into gases, gasoline, and middle distillate depending upon the composition of feed polymer/wax ratio. It was found that the products mostly consisted of paraffin and olefin compounds, with carbon numbers of C1–C4, C5–C9 and C10–C19 in the case of gases, gasoline and middle distillate respectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and petroleum wax under controlled temperatures with measurable product yields, product composition analysis, and experimental characterization techniques."
"Kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of co-pyrolysis of olive pomace and thermoplastic waste via thermogravimetric analysis This work represents the first attempt to analyze kinetics, thermodynamics and reaction mechanism of olive pomace (OP) and waste plastic materials (PM) co-pyrolysis. Among PM, polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), high density polypropylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and poly (ethylene terephthalate) glycol (PETG) were selected. Non-isothermal TG experiments were carried out under inert conditions at four heating rates, namely 5, 10, 20 and 40 °C/min. The kinetic triplet for raw materials and their blends was determined using Starink, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall iso-conversional models. Pyrolysis mechanism reactions were explained by diverse models, depending on thermal degradation progress. Results shown that co-pyrolysis followed a complex multi-step reaction mechanism. A synergistic effect was detected during co-pyrolysis of OP/PM mixtures. The addition of 50 % (w/w) OP biomass to PM waste decreased the energy of activation (Ea) from 50 to 25 % for all blends, except for PVC/OP. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that adding OP generally reduces the energy barrier (ΔH), except for PS-OP, and improves energy efficiency (ΔG) by facilitating radical formation and molecular chain cleavage. As a conclusion, this study may open up new avenues for waste valorization and resource recovery. Thus, it may contribute to the transition towards a circular and sustainable economy, through zero waste goal.","The study involves lab-scale thermogravimetric analysis of waste plastic pyrolysis (PP, PS, HDPE, PVC, PETG) with olive pomace, reporting measurable kinetic parameters, activation energy, and thermodynamic data."
"Thermal degradation of heterogeneous plastic waste fractions: A hybrid DAEM & parallel reaction approach Assessment of polymer decomposition rates through kinetic estimations is crucial considering the design and operation of process reactor systems. This study experimentally analyses weight loss patterns of pure plastic components (LDPE, HDPE, PP and PS) to evaluate decomposition kinetics through iso-conversional methods. Activation energy estimate for thermal degradation of the polymers follow normal distribution with accuracy of estimated kinetic parameters established though best fit of isoconversional plots. Evaluated parameters are applied with first order Distributed activation energy model (DAEM) and linear mixing rule to predict decomposition rate of pure as well as mixed plastic fractions. DAEM model predicts the activation energy distribution for degradation of LDPE, HDPE, PP and PS as 256, 257, 209 and 159 kJ/mol as mean values. Rate predictions for mixed plastic fractions are compared with literature through lower statistical parameter values ( χ 2 ) ranging from 1.49 × 10−5 - 9.21 × 10−6. Rate estimations for custom selected plastic combinations evaluated through developed approach specify dispersion of rate curves, represented through reduction in degradation temperature in the range of 15 – 60 °C characteristic of interactions. Further, study helps in predicting rate of any mixed plastic waste stream by minimizing experimentations, with seamless integration into commercial reactor design packages.","The study involves experimental thermal degradation of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP, PS) with measurable kinetic parameters, product yield predictions, and reactor-relevant data, satisfying all criteria for plastic pyrolysis research."
"Feedstock recycling of polymers by pyrolysis in a fluidised bed Feedstock recycling of polymers is an attractive option to recycle the increasing amount of plastic wastes and respond to restrictions for waste disposal in a lot of countries. Different processes are investigated such as degradation of plastics to monomers, pyrolysis into monomers and oil, gasification into syngas. Pyrolysis of mixed plastic wastes and elastomers is a cost-effective process to recover feedstocks for the petrochemical industry. The Hamburg process, using an indirectly heated fluidised bed, can be varied to produce mainly monomers, aliphatic hydrocarbons, or aromatics. At temperatures of 450 °C, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is depolymerised to more than 98% of the monomer. The influence of fillers on the monomer yield has been studied. Polystyrene as feed gives up to 75% of styrene and 10% of oligomers.

"Feedstock recycling of agriculture plastic film wastes by catalytic cracking Feedstock recycling by catalytic cracking of a real plastic film waste from Almeria greenhouses (Spain) towards valuable hydrocarbon mixtures has been studied over several acid catalysts. The plastic film waste was mostly made up of ambient degraded low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, the vinyl acetate content being around 4wt.%. Nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite (crystal size ∼60nm) was the only catalyst capable of degrading completely the refuse at 420°C despite using a very small amount of catalyst (plastic/catalyst mass ratio of 50). However, mesoporous catalysts (Al-SBA-15 and Al-MCM-41), unlike it occurred with virgin LDPE, showed fairly close conversions to that of thermal cracking. Nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite led to 60wt.% selectivity towards C1C5 hydrocarbons, mostly valuable C3C5 olefins, what would improve the profitability of a future industrial recycling process. The remarkable performance of nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite was ascribed to its high content of strong external acid sites due to its nanometer dimension, which are very active for the cracking of bulky macromolecules. Hence, nanocrystalline HZSM-5 can be regarded as a promising catalyst for a feasible feedstock recycling process by catalytic cracking.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of real waste plastic film (LDPE and EVA) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis as a recycling method of waste CDs originating from polycarbonate and HIPS Pyrolysis appears to be a promising recycling process since it could convert the disposed polymers to hydrocarbon based fuels or various useful chemicals. In the current study, two model polymers found in WEEEs, namely polycarbonate (PC) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and their counterparts found in waste commercial Compact Discs (CDs) were pyrolysed in a bench scale reactor. Both, thermal pyrolysis and pyrolysis in the presence of two catalytic materials (basic MgO and acidic ZSM-5 zeolite) was performed for all four types of polymers. Results have shown significant recovery of the monomers and valuable chemicals (phenols in the case of PC and aromatic hydrocarbons in the case of HIPS), while catalysts seem to decrease the selectivity towards the monomers and enhance the selectivity towards other desirable compounds.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PC and HIPS from CDs) with measurable product yields and catalyst performance analysis.
"Consecutive coproduction of H2 and syngas from waste polyolefins derived pyrolysis gas via chemical looping cracking–gasification Upcycling waste plastics into H2 and syngas offers a sustainable strategy for mitigating their accumulation and addressing the global issue of plastic pollution. The deposition of coke during thermocatalytic reforming processes poses a significant challenge for efficient conversion. Here we report the consecutive coproduction of high-concentration H2 (up to 80.5 vol%) and hydrocarbon-free syngas with tunable H2/CO ratios of 1.1–4.8 via a stepwise chemical looping cracking–gasification (CLCG) process over equimolar NiFeAl catalyst. Optimal gas yields of 0.26 mol gcata –1 and 0.52 mol gcata –1 per redox cycle for H2 and syngas are obtained from the cracking and gasification reaction stages, respectively. The CLCG process is investigated at a reaction temperature range of 700–900 °C which significantly impacts the H2/syngas coproduction due to the promoted catalyst reduction and segregation of Ni and Fe phases. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the metal distribution in the reduced NiFeAl catalysts by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the reaction temperature is essential in tuning the catalyst structure and performance. This work demonstrates the viable coproduction of separate H2 and syngas streams via the CLCG process which is promising for the circular management of waste plastics.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste polyolefins in a chemical looping cracking–gasification process, with measurable yields, temperature-dependent performance, and catalyst characterization."
"Study on preparation of aromatic-rich oil by thermal dechlorination and fast pyrolysis of PVC Thermal dechlorination and fast pyrolysis experiments of PVC were carried out. Characterizations such as TG, FTIR and 13C NMR were applied to analyze the thermal degradation characteristics and chemical structure evolution characteristics of de-HCl PVC during the dechlorination process. The thermal dechlorination results show that the degree of dechlorination and aromatization of de-HCl PVC is deepened with the increasing dechlorination temperature. The dechlorination efficiency is as high as 99.86% at 320 ℃. Meanwhile, the de-HCl PVC with a chlorine content of 0.22% and the optimal H/Ceff value for aromatics production can be obtained. The de-HCl PVC gradually evolves from a long chain structure with C-C bonds as the skeleton to a long olefin chain structure with partial aromatization during the dechlorination process. The fast pyrolysis results show that the oil generated by the de-HCl PVC (320 °C) pyrolysis has a high aromatic content of 97.32%−99.93%. In addition, there are no chlorine-containing compounds in the oil from de-HCl PVC (320 °C) pyrolysis, while the PVC pyrolysis oil contains chlorinated aromatics with high content of 1.91%−4.02%. During the fast pyrolysis process, the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) are mainly formed from the cyclization of polyene fragments released by random fragmentation of de-HCl PVC (320 ℃). Further, the polycondensation reaction is promoted to realize the conversion of MAHs to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under the action of high temperature. The by-products of pyrolysis gas with high HHV and carbon-rich char both can be further utilized. Overall, thermal dechlorination and fast pyrolysis can realize harmless treatment and high-value utilization of PVC.","The study involves lab-scale fast pyrolysis of waste PVC, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Upcycling of end-of-life wind turbine blades: Enhanced phenolic compounds production through catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy resin and polyvinylchloride with zinc chloride-balsa activated carbon Pyrolysis of core materials (balsa wood, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinylchloride) mixed directly with end-of-life wind turbine blades (EolWTBs) increased by-products and reduced the product quality. To maximize EolWTBs utilization, this study innovatively synthesized zinc chloride–activated carbon (ZnCl2–AC) using balsa cores (EolWTB-1) as waste-to-value for catalytic co-pyrolysis of epoxy resins (EolWTB-3) and polyvinylchloride cores (EolWTB-4) to enhance the phenolic compounds production. Fixed-bed experiments showed that 1ZnCl2–1AC with ZnCl2 activator and a Zn/balsa ratio of 1:1 exhibited the optimal performance at 600 °C. A synergistic effect was further observed when EolWTB-3 and EolWTB-4 were co-pyrolyzed at a mixing ratio of 0.75:0.25 with selectivity of 76.27 % and 96.27 % for phenol and phenolic compounds, respectively. The reusability test showed that the decreasing trend of phenol selectivity was slow and much higher than that of the non-catalytic group. Reaction mechanism studies showed that the high specific surface area of the catalyst with abundant Lewis acid sites promoted the aromatization of macromolecular organic compounds and the conversion of oxygen-containing functional groups to phenolic hydroxyl groups. The findings will simultaneously enable the waste-to-value conversion of balsa wood and upgrade the reuse value of EolWTBs, offering an alternative method for recycling EolWTBs.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (epoxy resin and polyvinylchloride) from end-of-life wind turbine blades, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and phenolic compound selectivity reported."
"Reverse engineering of plastic waste into useful fuel products This paper’s twofold aims are: to assess the potential of converting plastic waste into useful fuels in both continuous and batch pyrolysis reactors using an appropriate technology and to investigate the effect of silica-alumina catalyst on the yield and quality of pyrolytic liquid oil. The plastic waste used (HDPE, PP and PS) were obtained from Kiteezi landfill site, Kampala (Uganda). In a further step, the properties of the liquid fuel obtained from pyrolysis were also compared with commercial transportation fuel to ascertain its suitability on diesel engines.The fuel qualities were analysed using ASTM standard test methods At a degradation temperature of 450 °C, thermal pyrolysis in a batch reactor resulted in the highest yield of liquid fractions. The liquid yield of HDPE, PP and PS was found to be 80%, 82.6% and 80% by mass, respectively. In contrast, silica-alumina catalyst to feedstock ratio of 1:10 was the most effective in terms of gaseous fraction production. The gaseous fractions were: 60 wt% for the mixture, followed by HDPE (59.63 wt%), PS (59.07 wt%) and PP (49.33 wt%). A catalyst/polymer ratio of 1:10 greatly reduced the degradation temperature. The degradation temperature for HDPE, PP and PS was reduced by about 33%, 23% and 17%, respectively. The liquid oils from HDPE and PP had densities of 0.796 g/cm3 and 0.786 g/cm3; kinematic viscosities of 2.373 mm2/s and 2.115 mm2/s, dynamic viscosities of 1.889 mPas and 1.856 mPas; boiling point ranges of 119–364 °C and 148–355 °C; and cetane indices of 46 and 63, respectively. The characteristics of HDPE and PP pyrolytic sample oils are similar to conventional transportation fuel.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, PP, PS) with measurable yields, catalyst effects, product characterization, and fuel quality analysis according to ASTM standards."
"The behavior of heteroatom compounds during the pyrolysis of waste computer casing plastic under various heating conditions Single step and two-step pyrolysis of waste computer casing plastic were conducted to optimize both the product distribution and characteristics of liquid products. The single step pyrolysis was performed under various final temperatures ranging from 350 to 600 °C. The two-step pyrolysis was undertaken by initially increasing the temperatures to 350–380 °C and holding for 15 min, followed by a further increase to a peak temperature of 500 °C. The pyrolysis kinetic studies showed the activation energy of the two stages against conversion and revealed the synergistic reactions between BFR additives and plastic matrix. In the single step pyrolysis, fixed bed experiments showed that the final pyrolysis temperature had a significant influence on the product yield. The highest yield of 45.3 wt% oil was produced at 500 °C. The oil products mainly consisted of aromatic compounds, phenolic compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, and approximately 11.3–15.9 wt% of toxic bromine. For the two-step pyrolysis, the impurities of O-, N- and Br-containing compounds were mainly enriched in the pyrolytic oils from the first step. Comparatively, more than 57% of single aromatic compounds was obtained in the pyrolytic oils from the second step, with less than 2.0 wt% of bromine. Meanwhile, the depolymerization of the plastic for the formation of styrene was promoted at the second step. The results suggested that in the two stage pyrolysis, bromine can be transferred into the liquid phase in the first stage, thus producing bromine containing compounds deficient oil in the second stage.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste computer casing plastic, reports measurable product yields and composition, and includes experimental characterization of pyrolysis products under varying temperature conditions."
"Effects of hydrogen-donating solvents on the thermal degradation of HDPE The thermal cracking of a polyolefin (HDPE) has been investigated in the presence of solvents with different hydrogen-donating capabilities (9,10-dihydroanthracene, tetralin, decalin and 1-methylnaphthalene) with the aim of increasing the yields of C5–C32 α-olefins, which are valuable hydrocarbons for the chemical industry. The results have been also compared with the corresponding solventless reaction. The HDPE thermal degradation in the presence of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and tetralin, which are good hydrogen-donating solvents, led to the lowest yields of C5–C32 hydrocarbons. On the contrary, the reactions with the poor hydrogen-donating solvents, 1-methylnaphthalene and decalin, gave the highest C5–C32 yields, the main components of this fraction being α-olefins. However, the use of decalin is better recommended, because 1-methylnaphthalene loses its methyl group during the HDPE thermal degradation. These results have been explained based on the HDPE degradation mechanism. One of the main changes introduced by these solvents is the suppression of the reactions between intermediate radicals and α-olefins, effect which is responsible for the enhancement in the α-olefins content of the final products. In addition, the degradation mechanism includes hydrogen transfer reactions from the solvents to HDPE radicals and from the chains to the solvent radicals, which also contribute to increase the extension of the HDPE degradation and the production of α-olefins.",The study investigates the thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of HDPE plastic using hydrogen-donating solvents in a lab-scale experimental setup with measurable product yields and compositional analysis.
"Controlling generation of benzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in thermolysis of polyvinyl chloride in CO2 This study emphasizes the control of benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in thermolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) using CO2. To this end, the generation of benzenes and PAHs from the thermolysis of PVC in N2 was characterized and all experimental findings from the thermolysis of PVC in N2 were used as the reference value to configure the role of CO2 in the thermolysis of PVC. The formation of hydrogen chloride (HCl) followed by the subsequent dechlorination in the thermolysis of PVC in N2 resulted in the high yield of charring compounds, providing a favorable condition for forming benzene derivatives and PAHs. However, the thermal degradation of PVC in CO2 showed the genuine thermal degradation patterns. For instance, despite the presence of the source for oxygen, the formation of CO at temperatures higher than 600 °C was observed in the thermolysis of PVC in CO2, suggesting that some unknown reactions between hydrocarbons from the thermolysis of PVC and CO2 are initiated to form CO. In addition to these unknown reactions, the enhanced thermal cracking induced by CO2 was observed. Two identified roles of CO2 during the thermolysis of CO2 was only limited at temperatures higher than 600 °C. However, despite no precise description for the mechanistic role of CO2 at this stage of study, the formation of benzene derivatives and PAHs was effectively controlled in the presence of CO2 at temperatures higher than 480 °C. Thus, these empirical findings in this study are necessary to further be investigated in the future, which offers a great venue offering a new means for modifying and/or controlling the harmful chemical species.","The study involves lab-scale thermolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a waste plastic, with measurable product formation (benzene derivatives, PAHs, CO) and temperature-dependent analysis, including catalyst-free reactor conditions and product characterization."
"Co-pyrolysis of green coconut fibers with polymers: Enhanced the quality of produced bio-oil aiming bio-fuel production Co-pyrolysis of residual biomass with plastics emerges as a promising alternative for sustainable energy generation, mainly due to the environmental impact and the possibility of obtain biofuels and bioproducts. Biomass is recognized as a renewable resource while plastic waste poses an environmental challenge due to its high volume and low recycling rate. By merging these residues in a thermal conversion process, both can be transformed into biofuels, thereby reducing improper disposal and promoting the circular bioeconomy. In this study, bio-oils obtained from fast co-pyrolysis in a microscale fixed-bed reactor were chemically analyzed using gas chromatography (GC/MS) for compound identification. Green coconut fibers were collected, deposited on the soil, exposed to environmental factors for 30 days, and subjected to pyrolysis. The samples were characterized by proximate and elemental analysis, high heating value (HHV) and thermal gravimetrical analysis (TGA). Mixtures of this biomass with polymers (PP, HDPE, and LDPE), were pyrolyzed and the bio-oils were chromatographically analyzed. The analysis of resulting bio-oils revealed that the mixture containing 25 % of each of the three polymers and 25 % of biomass was the most effective, reducing phenols and furans, and eliminating ketones.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP, HDPE, LDPE) with green coconut fibers in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable product yields, GC–MS analysis of bio-oil composition, and quantitative optimization of blend ratios."
"Influence of metallic additives on thermal degradation and liquefaction of high density polyethylene (HDPE) This study evaluates the effect of typical polymer fillers on the thermal degradation of a commodity plastic to produce liquid fuels. HDPE was degraded in the presence and absence of some metallic additives such as Al(OH)3·xH2O, AlCl3, Al2O3, CaCO3, CuO, ZrO2, and Fe2O3. Liquefaction of HDPE in the presence of selected additives was also carried out to verify the thermal gravimetric data. The HDPE liquefaction conditions such as temperature, effect of H2 or N2 pressure, and time were established before studying the effect of additives. At 50% weightloss, Al2O3 increased the degradation temperature by ~30 °C, whereas ZrO2 and CaCO3 decreased it by ~30 and 70 °C, respectively. All the additives were thermally stable below 600 °C except AlCl3 and Al(OH)3·xH2O. Under the experimental conditions used, the thermal degradation trend of HDPE in the presence of Al2O3 was clearly reflected in the liquefaction product analysis. With Al2O3, the liquefaction of HDPE was delayed, which in turn resulted in wax formation. It was further proved by simulated distillation and gel permeation chromatographic analysis. More gas in the presence of ZrO2 and more oil (85%) in the case of CaCO3 were produced when compared to the liquefaction of HDPE alone (75%). However, the simulated distillation and GPC analysis of these products obtained at the end of 30 min liquefaction time did not show significant variation when compared to that of HDPE alone. The nature of gas did not affect the oil yield. However, the temperature and time were critical in obtaining the maximum oil yield.","The study involves lab-scale thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of HDPE plastic with metallic additives, reports measurable product yields (oil, gas), and includes experimental characterization such as TGA, simulated distillation, and GPC analysis."
"Cracking catalysts used as fluidized bed material in the Hamburg pyrolysis process The effects of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts as fluidized bed material on the pyrolysis of polystyrene and polyethylene were investigated at temperatures between 370 and 515°C in a scale of ∼1 kgh−1. The results were compared qualitatively with pyrolysis-GC-MS-experiments (200 μg). The catalytic influence on the product distribution is easily seen by the comparison to non-catalytic experiments with simple quartz sand. In the catalytic polystyrene pyrolysis, the product distribution is changed from the usual main product styrene (61 wt.%) to basic chemicals (18–26 wt.% ethylbenzene, 9–22 wt.% benzene, 1–7 wt.% styrene, 3–5 % toluene) and soot (15–23 wt.%). Surprisingly, it was shown that in the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene even at low temperatures (450–515°C) gases (48–52 wt.%) and low boiling aliphatic oils (38–39 wt.%) were received instead of waxes (∼90 wt.%) in non-catalytic experiments. A further success of the catalytic pyrolysis is a dramatic reduction of the process temperature. Pyrolysis-GC-MS-experiments confirmed these results qualitatively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (polystyrene and polyethylene) using catalytic fluidized bed reactors with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization via GC–MS."
"H-ZSM-11 and Zn-ZSM-11 zeolites and their applications in the catalytic transformation of LDPE Low density polyethylene was converted into hydrocarbons over Zn- and H-ZSM-11 zeolite catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor during 20 and 60min reaction time, 0.5 and 2.0 polymer to catalyst mass ratio at 500°C. The zeolites were synthesized by conventional techniques and characterized by XRD, pyridine FTIR and N2 adsorption. The adsorbed pyridine spectra demonstrated that new Lewis sites were formed after Zn exchange, and that the relationship between Lewis and Brönsted sites in the Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite (3.53) was much higher than that in the H-ZSM-11 zeolite (0.09). Thermal analyses confirmed that the temperature of decomposition of the polymer can be decreased in as much as about 145°C when the catalysts were added. As compared to the thermal degradation, the catalytic conversion produced less solid residues and much higher amounts of gas and liquid hydrocarbons. The catalysts showed different yield profiles: the H-ZSM-11 zeolite yielded more gases, while the Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite yielded more liquid products. Notably over Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite, these liquid products were mainly aromatic, and depending on experimental conditions (higher temperature, longer reaction time, smaller polymer/catalyst relationship), aromatic selectivity could be increased to almost 100%.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"The synergistic mechanism between coke depositions and gas for H2 production from co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes via char supported catalyst Co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene(PE) wastes with different blending ratios were performed in a bench-scale fixed bed over Ni/char catalyst. The synergistic mechanism between coke depositions and gas products during co-pyrolysis was studied for better regulation of H2 production. The results showed that feedstock blending ratio played a decisive role in competitive growth of amorphous coke and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the catalyst surface. For low PE ratio (≤50 wt%) a negative synergy on H2 yield was generated. It was ascribed to more oxygenates that were more inclined than hydrocarbons to be absorbed by porous char to form amorphous coke, which encapsulated Ni active sites and internal pore channel of catalyst, thus resulting in deactivation of catalyst. For higher PE content, Ni/char catalyst produced more than triple the amounts of H2 yield (42.28 mmol/gfeedstock) as compared to low PE ratio (11.3 mmol/gfeedstock). A maximum positive synergy on syngas quality was yielded at 75% PE. Despite the high yield (37.8 wt%) of deposited coke, more hydrocarbon gas from plastic pyrolysis condensed on catalyst and promoted CNTs growth via dehydrogenation and polymerization, simultaneously generating H2. The unique hollow tubular structure and tip-growth mode of CNTs exposed more Ni active sites and endowed catalyst with lower deactivation extent. The scission of more chain hydrocarbons was subsequently enhanced to interact with oxygenated compounds. Therefore, appropriate PE ratios (>50%) can exert a positive synergy on gaseous conversion by regulating coke nature during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. Furthermore, coke structure rather than content seems to exert more significant effect.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of polyethylene waste and biomass, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analysis of coke and gas composition."
"Co-pyrolysis of wood and plastics: Influence of plastic type and content on product yield, gas composition and quality In recent years, the world has witnessed a rapid rise in waste production and energy demand, which has increased interests in waste to energy processes, particularly the co-pyrolysis of wood and plastic waste. Nonetheless, for plastic waste, most research studies narrowly focus on polyolefins because of their abundance in waste streams and their high oil yields from pyrolysis. In this paper, we study the co-pyrolysis of non-polyolefins – polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) – and poplar wood (PW), in order to investigate the synergistic effect of PS and PVC content on product yield, gas specie yield and heating value. The experiments were performed using a fixed-bed reactor, heated to 750 ° C at a rate of 20 ° C/min under nitrogen atmosphere. Our results show that PVC has a large positive synergy on char yield with a maximum value of 8 wt% at 30 wt% PVC content, whereas PS only showed a slightly positive synergy (2.5 wt% maximum). Concerning oil and gas production, PS provides a small synergy. However, PVC showed a significant positive synergy on oil yield with a maximum value of 11 wt% at 50 wt% PVC content, which was linked to a strong negative synergy in gas production. Regarding gas specie yields, the addition of PS led to positive synergies in the formation of H2, CH4, CO and CO2, although insignificant interactions were observed for C x H y compounds. Furthermore, by comparing the distribution of chloride species in the products of co-pyrolysis with PVC, using experimental and theoretical methods, we discovered that the negative synergy in HCl yield observed was mainly due to the dissolution of HCl in the water fraction of the condensed oil phase, rather than the formation of chlorinated organic compounds, as suggested in previous literature works. Our study therefore consolidates the understanding of the synergistic interactions between wood, PS and PVC co-pyrolysis, under conditions that favour gas production.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (PS and PVC) with wood, reporting measurable product yields, gas composition, and synergy effects under defined reactor conditions."
"Towards fuels production by a catalytic pyrolysis of a real mixture of post-consumer plastic waste The contribution provides a valorization alternative for rejected plastic wastes from mechanical-biological treatment (non-recyclable material) via an in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process focused on the production of a liquid fraction with similar properties to traditional fuels (i.e., gasoline, kerosine, and diesel). According to the ASTM recommendations, on small samples without prior physical separation, fuel fraction identification was carried out by Simulated Distillation along with a hydrocarbon types analysis and complemented with CHNS-O analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Two catalytic structures were employed named Sepiolite and Montmorillonites, both K10 and K30, which after simple heat treatment to stabilize the structure, were characterized to analyze the main properties affecting the catalytic activity and product yields (i.e., morphological and acidity properties). A whole screaming of the products by analogy with hydrocarbon of the petroleum industry is presented. Such an approach allows a real evaluation of the studied technology in the current energy scenario.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of fuel products."
"Thermal decomposition of individual and mixed plastics in the presence of CaO or Ca(OH)2 Individual and mixed plastics consisting of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) were decomposed at 600°C in the presence and absence of either calcium oxide (CaO) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) under a steam atmosphere. In the presence of CaO, steam cracking was enhanced, increasing gas and liquid yields and decreasing the wax content derived from PE and PP. The production of sublimating substances from PET was also reduced. However, the presence of CaO and steam had a negative influence on PS degradation, reducing the oil yield. In addition, synergistic effects were observed in plastic mixtures. PET enhanced gasification, PS and PET reduced wax production from PE and PP, and mixing all four plastics enhanced oil production in the presence of CaO and steam. Both CaO and Ca(OH)2 enhanced the total gas and oil yield of mixed plastics, achieving a maximum oil yield of 52.2wt% in the presence of steam. Furthermore, solids were almost completely decomposed at 700°C, with only 0.2wt% of residue remaining.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET) with measurable yields, catalyst effects, and product characterization under defined conditions."
"Kinetic modelling of the cracking of HDPE pyrolysis volatiles on a HZSM-5 zeolite based catalyst Continuous catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene has been carried out for obtaining light olefins in a two step reaction system: (i) thermal pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed at 500°C; (ii) cracking of the volatiles (mainly waxes, C21+) formed in the first step, in a fixed bed reactor using a catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite. A kinetic model based on lumps including catalyst deactivation by coke deposition has been established to quantify the product distribution obtained in the second step and its evolution with time on stream. Experimental data have been obtained at 400, 450 and 500°C, with space-times of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8gcat mingHDPE −1 and for 5h time on stream. The discrimination of kinetic models has been carried out based on statistics calculated for Fischer distribution (stepwise procedure), and the best fits have been obtained for a model considering six steps: cracking of waxes to produce non-aromatic C5–C11 compounds, single-ring aromatics, light alkanes and light olefins; cracking of non-aromatic C5–C11 compounds to yield light olefins and light olefin condensation reactions to produce single-ring aromatic compounds. The deactivation kinetic equation considers waxes as main coke precursors, whose deposition rate decreases with time on stream.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed and fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and kinetic modeling based on experimental data."
"Analysis of products derived from the fast pyrolysis of plastic waste Plastic Waste has become an increased problem in many industrialised countries. Concern over the volumes being created has lead to a number of governments introducing new legislation for its recovery as a resource. Traditional recovery methods have generally concentrated on recycling of materials or incineration for energy. The majority of polymers in waste are mainly hydrocarbon in nature and so can be used as a feedstock for the chemical industries or as a fuel. Pyrolysis is a tertiary recycling process and has an ability to provide three end products: a gas, an oil and a char which all have the potential to be further utilised. It is anticipated that if waste recovery targets currently being set are to be met then methods, such as pyrolysis, will have to be closely examined. The pyrolysis of a plastic mixture in a fluidised bed reactor was studied. The mixture was a simulated fraction of that found in municipal solid waste in Europe. The reactor was constructed of stainless steel and was 70 cm high × 10 cm diameter, with a 17 cm high × 20 cm diameter expander section. The sample was introduced batchwise into the bed. The influence of temperature on product yield and composition was studied. Pyrolysis was carried out at temperatures between 500 and 700°C. This gave widely differing product yields of between 9.79 and 88.76% gas and between 18.44 and 57.11% oil. The oils were analysed for their functional groups using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The molecular weight distribution was also determined using size exclusion chromatography. It was found that as temperature was increased the amount of aromatic compounds in the oil increased. The molecular weight range was also affected. Potential applications for the oils was also investigated.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of simulated municipal plastic waste in a fluidized bed reactor, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of oil composition and molecular weight distribution."
"Copyrolysis of oils/waxes of individual and mixed polyalkenes cracking products with petroleum fraction Copyrolysis of 10 mass% solutions (oils/waxes from individual or mixed polymers with heavy naphtha) is a route for treatment of plastic waste. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), mixture of high-density polyethylene/low-density polyethylene/linear low-density polyethylene/polypropylene (HDPE/LDPE/LLDPE/PP=1:1:1:1mass) and linear low-density polyethylene/low-density polyethylene/polypropylene/high-density polyethylene/polyvinyl chloride/polyethylene terepthalate/polystyrene (LLDPE/LDPE/PP/HDPE/PVC/PET/PS=1:1:2:2:0.05:0.05:0.156 mass) were converted to oils/waxes, gases and solid residues by thermal decomposition in batch reactor at 450 °C. Oils/waxes were dissolved in virgin heavy naphtha to create the feedstock. The influence of residence time from 0.08 to 0.51 s at temperatures 780 °C and 820 °C on product distribution during the copyrolysis was studied. The yields obtained from gaseous and liquid products of solutions are compared to the yields obtained from virgin heavy naphtha. It was studied how addition of the oil/wax influences formation of C2 and C3 hydrocarbons (mainly ethene and propene) and aromatics in comparison to the virgin heavy naphtha. The ethene and propene yields from copyrolysis of solutions are comparable or higher than from virgin heavy naphtha. Copyrolysis of solution LLDPE/LDPE/PP/HDPE/PVC/PET/PS gives the maximum yields of propene from all studied oils/waxes. The result suggests that oils/waxes from polymers are suitable feedstocks for copyrolysis with virgin heavy naphtha.","The study involves thermal decomposition of waste plastics (LLDPE, HDPE, LDPE, PP, PVC, PET, PS) in a batch reactor, producing oils/waxes, gases, and solid residues, followed by copyrolysis with heavy naphtha, with measurable product yields and composition analysis."
"Benchmarking performance of equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking catalysts in the catalytic cracking of polypropylene With the transition of the chemical industry towards renewable and recycled feedstocks, cracking catalysts are explored for a new application in converting difficult to recycle polyolefin plastics to feeds for the chemical industry. The refining industry generates large volumes of equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking catalysts (ECAT) as waste materials, which might find a secondary end-of-life application as plastic cracking catalyst. Herein, we aim at establishing which ECAT materials are particularly attractive for plastic waste conversion. We screened a broad range of materials selected for both their activity and accessibility. We establish the range of activity which is achievable with this type of catalyst, placing important boundaries on process conditions. We find that an industry standard vacuum gas oil (VGO) cracking activity test, namely the fluid bed simulated test, not only predicts plastic cracking activity, but is also a very good indicator for propylene selectivity. Historical data gathered by industrial researchers might therefore prove highly useful in identifying more active and selective plastic cracking catalysts, offering concrete guidance on catalyst selection. This finding further suggests that the active sites critical for cracking of VGO are of similar importance for plastic cracking. However, we find that various characterization techniques including physisorption, contaminant analysis and determination of external acidity do not offer concrete guidance on catalyst selection. This work therefore demonstrates the limitations of routine catalyst characterization as an indicator of performance, but showcases how established activity metrics can aid in the transition of the chemical industry to recycled feedstocks.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, using lab-scale fluid bed simulated testing with measurable activity and selectivity outcomes."
"Processing plastic waste via pyrolysis-thermolysis into hydrogen and solid carbon additive to ethylene-vinyl acetate foam for cushioning applications A strategy for enhancing value creation from pyrolysis gas and oil, derived from plastic waste, through the generation of two additional outputs of solid carbon and hydrogen was investigated. Three types of hard-to-recycle plastic waste (marine plastic litter, household mixed plastics and cosmetic products packaging) were thermally treated in two stages: (i) decomposition of feedstock into gas and oil via pyrolysis at 600 °C; and (ii) thermolytic conversion of the pyrolysis gas and a fraction of oil into hydrogen and solid carbon at 1300 °C separately. The thermolysis of both pyrolysis gas and oil fractions predominantly resulted in the production of solid carbon (39–70 wt% per plastic feedstock and carbon content of 91.3–98.6 wt%) and H2-rich gas (H2 yield of 5.9–10.8 wt% per plastic waste feedstock and H2 content of 71.4–97.2 vol% per gas volume). The incorporation of pyrolysis oil into the thermolysis process could enhance the outputs of solid carbon and hydrogen. Characterizations of solid carbon and hydrogen obtained from pyrolysis gas and oil fractions were further conducted. The observed similar properties of H2 and solid carbon from pyrolysis gas and oil supported the feasibility of introducing all the pyrolytic products together into the thermolysis process without condensation of oil. To enhance the value of these solid carbon derived from plastics for practical usage, we utilized the obtained solid carbon as a reinforcing agent for polymer composite foam development. The solid carbon reinforced composite foam displayed great abrasion resistance (wear loss: 240 mg), compression strength (0.347 MPa), and dynamic impact properties (energy returned: 124 J/m and energy absorbed: 57.3 J/m), emphasizing the viability of solid carbon as a nucleating agent and reinforcing filler in polymer foam for cushioning applications. Overall, the strategy of pyrolysis-thermolysis, which harnesses both pyrolysis gas and oil, unlocks additional value creation by producing two new outputs from plastic waste. Depending on the market prices for solid carbon and hydrogen, this can substantially change the economics of plastic waste management and create new revenue streams, incentivizing plastic waste collection and processing.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (marine litter, mixed plastics, cosmetic packaging) at 600 °C, followed by thermolysis at 1300 °C, with measurable yields of oil, gas, solid carbon, and hydrogen, along with product characterization and performance testing of the resulting solid carbon in foam applications."
"Catalytic properties in polyolefin cracking of hierarchical nanocrystalline HZSM-5 samples prepared according to different strategies Two series of hierarchical nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by different synthesis strategies (at low temperature and from silanized seeds) and with external surface areas ranging from 150 to 250m2 g−1 were tested in the cracking of pure LDPE and HDPE at 340°C and of waste polyethylene at 360°C. Hierarchical zeolites showed quite higher activity, with values even six times higher than a standard nanocrystalline sample used as reference (n-HZSM-5). The activity values decreased from LDPE to HDPE due to the occurrence of some degree of branching in the former polymer, which act as preferential cracking sites. The major products were C1–C4 hydrocarbons (in the range 30–70%, mostly C3–C4 olefins) and C5–C12 hydrocarbons (20–60%), whose share depends on both the polyolefin and the catalyst. The amount of C13–C40 hydrocarbons was practically negligible (<1%) due to the high acid strength of the zeolites which promotes end-chain cracking reactions. Likewise, hierarchical nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites prepared from silanized protozeolitic units showed higher activities than the hierarchical nanocrystalline HZSM-5 samples synthesized at low temperature and atmospheric pressure. The differences were especially remarkable in the case of waste polyethylene cracking. These results were ascribed to the stronger acidity of the hierarchical zeolite samples prepared from silanized seeds.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Carbon nanotubes production from catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over nickel-based catalysts: The influence of support materials To understand the influence of support materials on the reactivity of catalysts, four nickel- based catalysts supported on different materials (ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, and Al2O3) were developed and investigated in the carbon nanotubes production from catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene using two-stage fixed bed reactor. The results showed that the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst generated the highest carbon material yield of 36.5 wt%, while the order of carbon material yield was Ni/Al2O3 > Ni/TiO2 > Ni/ZrO2 > Ni/Nb2O5. To explore the correlation between catalysts properties and carbon products, the essential structural characteristics of fresh catalyst and reacted catalyst were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature program oxidation (TPO), nitrogen adsorption measurements and Raman spectroscopy. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with the highest surface area, abundant pore structure, and moderate metal-support interaction promoted the decomposition of pyrolysis volatiles to produce carbon nanomaterials, which were consist of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs are the main component of carbon materials produced, accounting for a relatively high proportion. In comparison, the large metal active particles and weak metal-support interaction of Ni/TiO2 catalyst had a negative impact on the formation of CNTs, generating many fishbone like carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Moreover, the poor pore structure and larger metal active particles for Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Nb2O5 catalyst led to a low carbon deposition yield and poor quality of CNTs. The results provide valuable data and theoretical support for the research on the preparation of valuable carbon nanotubes from waste plastics.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene, a waste plastic, in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization."
"Co-pyrolysis of hydrothermally pre-treated microalgae residue and polymeric waste (plastic/tires): Comparative and dynamic analyses of pyrolytic behaviors, kinetics, chars, oils, and in-situ gas emissions Biomass and polymeric wastes are becoming more problematic economically and environmentally. Their co-pyrolysis could be a cost-effective and environmentally preferable alternative for reducing waste quantities and gas emissions, as well as recovering valuable oils, chars, and gases. This study aimed to dynamically characterize the co-pyrolysis of hydrothermally treated Chlorella sorokiniana residue (CSR) and waste polymers (polystyrene (PS) and waste tires (WT)) based on their pyrolytic behaviors, kinetics, interaction effects, bio-chars, bio-oils, and in-situ evolved gasses characteristics. The devolatilization of CSR mainly occurred between 150 and 500 °C, while the decomposition of WT and PS appeared between 200–550 °C and 300–550 °C, respectively. The average activation energy was 179.25, 222.82, and 223.12 kJ/mol for the CSR, WT, and PS devolatilization, respectively. The TG-FTIR-detected functional groups included CH (stretching vibration), CH (in-plane & out-of-plane bending vibration), CC, CO2, OH, CO, COOH, CO, and NH3. The TG-MS-detected pyrolytic products were CHO+, CH3O+, C2H3O+, C3H3O+ C3H6O+, C4H3O+, C5H6O+, COOH+, NH3 +, aliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the pyrolytic oil was found to be more stable, with significantly fewer N- and O-containing compounds. It seemed that the inclusion of PS and WT in CSR pyrolysis reduce the additional fuel processing requirements to transform liquid yields into useful fuel. This research findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the control and application potential as well as the limitations of the high-value energy and products derived from the co-pyrolysis of CSR, PS, and WT.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polymers (PS and WT) with hydrothermally pre-treated microalgae residue, with measurable product yields, kinetic analysis, and detailed characterization of oils, chars, and gas emissions."
"Pyrolysis-plasma/catalytic reforming of post-consumer waste plastics for hydrogen production Different types of single waste plastics and a range of real-world mixed waste plastics from several different industrial and commercial sources have been processed in a pyrolysis-plasma/catalytic experimental reactor system for the production of hydrogen. The hydrocarbons produced from the pyrolysis stage were catalytically (Ni/MCM-41) steam reformed in a low temperature, non-thermal plasma/catalytic reactor. The polyolefin plastics, high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and polypropylene produced the highest yield of hydrogen at 18.0, 17.3 and 16.3 mmol g−1 plastics respectively. The aromatic structured polystyrene produced a lower hydrogen yield of 11.9 mmol g−1 plastics and polyethylene terephthalate with an aromatic and oxygenated structure produced only 10.2 mmol g−1 plastics and a high yield of carbon oxide gases. The real-world mixed plastic waste produced yields of hydrogen in the range of 13.4–16.9 mmol g−1 plastics. The lowest hydrogen yield of 13.4 mmol g−1 plastics was produced from the mineral water bottle packaging waste due to the high content of polyethylene terephthalate in the plastic waste mixture.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET) with measurable hydrogen yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Application of a particle model to pyrolysis. Comparison of different feedstock: Plastic, tyre, coal and biomass The thermal behaviour of solid particles of plastic, tyre, coal and biomass as feedstock in pyrolysis processes was studied. The samples were pyrolyzed in a thermogravimetric analyzer in nitrogen atmosphere (surface flow rate 2.65·10−3 m/s) at two different heating rates (5 and 10°C/min) with temperatures ranging from 150 to 950°C. This paper shows the successful application of the distributed energy model to study the effects of dynamic experiments on the solid pyrolysis, in particular, to ABS plastic and tyre rubber for the first time. In addition, the reaction model algorithm used was successfully implemented together with a heat transfer model to predict temperature profiles in the particle and to explore the effects of both solid characteristics and process conditions on the pyrolysis. Within the process conditions studied (particle size, inlet feedstock temperature, reactor temperature and global heat transfer coefficient) the particle size was the most influencing one. From the solid characteristics, the main influence in the particle behaviour was attributed to the characteristic devolatilisation obtained in thermobalance showing the physicochemical properties a weak influence on it.",The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of ABS plastic using a thermogravimetric analyzer with measured temperature–yield relationships and product behavior analysis.
"Tuning the morphology and textural properties of ZSM-5 additive for co-cracking of waste plastics with vacuum gas oil to light olefins Typical cracking catalysts, called equilibrium catalyst (E-Cat) are ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite often used with 15% commercial ZSM-5 zeolite additive (ZSM-5(COM)) to boost olefin yield. In this study, similar additive zeolites with different pore sizes and acidic character were synthesized by rapid ageing of precursor solution and used in the co-cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO). Three ZSM-5 zeolites additives with Si/Al ratio 25 (ZSM-5(25)), 50 (ZSM-5(50)) and 75 (ZSM-5(75)) were synthesized and combined with E-Cat to form E-Cat/ZSM-5(25), E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) and E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) respectively. The E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) has slightly better endothermic conversion (cracking) of a mixture of dissolved LDPE and HVGO into H2, C1 to C4 gases and C2-C4 light olefins (total conversion of E-Cat 80.0%, E-Cat/ZSM-5(COM) 75.0% and E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) 83.7% respectively), with different gas, liquid and coke distributions. The E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) has 81% conversion, and highest yield of light olefins (38.4%). Structural (surface area, pore size) and chemical (acid sites) characteristics of the synthetized ZSM-5(75) zeolite explain the observed higher light olefin selectivity by different and competing catalytic routes. The ZSM-5(75) has demonstrated to be a good zeolite additive for converting dissolved plastic in HVGO into light olefins.","The study involves lab-scale co-cracking of waste plastic (LDPE) with vacuum gas oil using synthesized ZSM-5 zeolite additives, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and structural characterization."
"Production of light hydrocarbons from pyrolysis of heavy gas oil and high density polyethylene using pillared clays as catalysts Mesoporous catalysts are currently used in the petroleum and petrochemical industry to convert heavy hydrocarbons into light ones. There is a few papers on iron-pillared clays are available. In the catalytic pyrolysis, it was used a commercial clay fractionated to remove sand and silt and treated to remove soluble salts and the organic fraction. That clay was intercalated with iron or aluminum oligomers and calcined at specific temperatures to form pillars in the layers. The main advantage of the use of pillared clays in catalytic pyrolysis is that their cost is much more reduced than that of zeolite catalysts. All thermal pyrolysis at 500°C have high pyrolysis oil yield (>80%), except for the pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) using zeolite as catalyst. It was observed significant difference in the catalytic pyrolysis of the HDPE at 450°C as the following: zeolite > Al-PILC–450≈Fe-PILC–450> Fe-PILC–300> Al-PILC-Fe-450. The presence of heavy gas oil (HGO) improves the oil yield from both thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, which can be attributed to the solvency effect of HGO. Pyrolysis oils were analyzed by GCAR-MS and their profiles were compared to the standard diesel. The oil from the HGO/HDPE pyrolysis using the catalyst Fe-PILC-Fe-300 was the more similar to the GC–MS homologous series of standard diesel. That catalyst produced a light linear hydrocarbon content 63% higher than that produced with zeolite.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE), a commercial plastic, using lab-scale experiments with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis via GC–MS."
"Experimental evaluation of product yield by pyrolysis of medical waste: a way of energy recovery The proper management of medical waste is a significant global concern, requiring new disposal methods while also recovering energy. This paper explores the viability of energy recovery from medical waste by pyrolysis with a focus on experimentally evaluating the product yield. To conduct the pyrolysis process, an external heating batch reactor was built, where various types of medical waste, including saline bottles, syringes, and medical gloves, were thermally degraded. The main goals of the study were to investigate the effects of varying medical waste mixtures and temperatures on product yields and to determine the physicochemical properties of the produced pyrolytic oil. The maximum yield of liquid products was about 59.5 % at 350 °C for the saline bottle-syringe blend. The maximum liquid yield for the hand gloves-saline bottle blend, hand gloves-syringe blend, and saline bottle-syringe-hand gloves blend was 49 %, 48 %, and 50 %, respectively, at 400 °C. These yields were slightly lower than the saline bottle-syringe blend due to the presence of rubber compound hand gloves in these mixtures. The pyrolytic oil exhibited a density range from 777.5–849.3 kg/m3, while its viscosity ranged from 1.15–2.1 cSt. The flash point of the oil ranged from 38–41 °C, and the boiling point ranged from 99–129 °C. The calorific value of pyrolytic oil was found to be 41.1 MJ/kg, which is very close to that of conventional fuels. The FTIR analysis of the pyrolytic oil samples showed characteristic functional groups, primarily alkanes and alkenes. The findings reveal insights into the optimal conditions for maximizing product yield and highlight the potential of pyrolysis as a viable method for both waste management and energy recovery within the medical sector. This study contributes to the advancement of sustainable practices in healthcare waste management and underscores the importance of exploring alternative energy sources for a more environmentally conscious future.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of medical waste plastics (e.g., saline bottles, syringes, gloves) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of pyrolytic oil."
"Biocarbon from spent coffee ground and their sustainable biocomposites with recycled water bottle and bale wrap: A new life for waste plastics and waste food residues for industrial uses The current study investigates the recyclability of water bottles (PET) and bale wrap (LLDPE) blends reinforced with biocarbon, for developing sustainable biocomposites with more than 95% recycled material. The reinforcing agent (biocarbon) has been made by pyrolyzing the waste coffee ground at an elevated temperature. Enhanced interfacial adhesion and reinforcement leads to improvement in the flexural modulus (∼55%) and storage modulus (38%) of the biocomposite with biocarbon obtained by pyrolyzing at 900 °C. The presence of lower particle size and relatively higher modulus of biocarbon (900 °C) in comparison to biocarbon (500 °C) results in resistance in polymer chain movement consequently enhance tensile modulus of biocomposite by 39%. Theoretical calculation of reinforcing efficiency factor (r) and effectiveness coefficient of the reinforcement (C) indicates the homogeneous dispersion of biocarbon in the polymer matrix. Overall, developed biocomposites can be a potential candidate for developing the filaments for 3D printing as well as rigid packaging.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste coffee grounds to produce biocarbon, which is used to reinforce recycled PET and LLDPE, with measurable product characteristics and performance data reported."
"Integrating microwave pyrolysis and hydrotreating for converting low-density polyethylene into jet fuel With the increasing plastic waste and its environmental impact, finding effective recycling solutions is essential. Cracking plastic waste followed by hydrogenation could be a promising method for producing jet fuels. In the present work, microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) with MgO combined with hydrotreating with a Ni/Biochar catalyst was firstly proposed to convert low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into jet fuel. The pyrolysis process yielded 48.5 wt% of liquid product, with C5−C15 hydrocarbons and olefins accounting for 87.6% and 65.5%, respectively. During the hydrotreating process with 10% Ni/Biochar at 300°C of temperature and 2 MPa of initial H2 pressure, the pyrolysis oil was successfully hydrotreated, resulting in 98.4% paraffins and 1.6% aromatics with liquid yield of 80.6 wt%. Among them, C5−C15 hydrocarbons created 96.1%. The kinetic analysis indicated an activation energy of 89.9 kJ/mol for hydrogenated LDPE pyrolysis oil (HPPO). Characterization of the Ni/Biochar catalyst after reaction showed a BET surface area of 438 m2/g, similar to that of the fresh catalyst, with minimal coke formation noted via XRD, TEM, and TG analyses. XPS and FTIR indicated negligible oxidation of Ni0 during hydroprocessing. After 6 cycles, the catalyst remained high abundance for paraffins and C5−C15 hydrocarbons, namely, 98.4% and 94.0%, respectively, demonstrating its stability.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and catalysts."
"Vacuum pyrolysis of electric cable wastes Metal-free electric cable waste was pyrolyzed at a reduced total pressure of 20 kPa and at a temperature of 450 °C. The two main products were wax (71 wt.%) and pyrolytic carbon black (CBp, 21 wt.%). Pyrolytic wax and CBp were compared with commercial grade materials using FT-IR, ESCA, SIMS and XRD. Similarly to commercial wax, the pyrolytic wax consists mostly of alkyl chains. However, it contains more olefinic groups and the alkyl chains are less branched than commercial wax. The CBp has a high BET surface area (60 m2 g−1), higher than commercial carbon blacks of the N500 series. It contained less than 5 wt.% CaCO3, the only inorganic component detected. The surface chemistry of the organic CBp portion was found to be very close to commercial carbon black N539.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of electric cable waste (a type of plastic waste) at 450 °C under reduced pressure, with measurable yields of wax and pyrolytic carbon black, and extensive analytical characterization including FT-IR, XRD, and BET surface area."
"Primary fragmentation behavior of refuse derived fuel pellets during rapid pyrolysis Primary fragmentation during rapid pyrolysis is considered to be the critical size reduction mechanism as it determines the particle size distribution and char conversion rates in the fixed bed gasifier. This study aims to investigate the primary fragmentation behavior of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) pellets during a rapid pyrolysis process. RDF pellets consisted of different blending ratios of cardboard and polyethylene (PE) were produced by a single-pellet densification process. Pyrolysis tests at temperature ranges of 500–700 °C were performed for each pellet type, and the number and particle size of the fragmented particles were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the different composition of RDF causes different particle binding mechanisms that behave differently during pyrolysis. Densification of cardboard particles can maintain the structure of the pellet char at higher temperatures compared to PE, due to the more stable lignin binding mechanism. A modified Fragmentation Ratio (FR) is introduced to quantify the degree of fragmentation. It is shown that a raise of the concentration of PE from 25 to 75 wt% increases the FR value by up to 4.2 times, whereas an increase in pyrolysis temperature from 500 to 700 °C only slightly changes the FR values. It can be concluded that the type of materials in the RDF pellet has a more dominating effect on the fragmentation compared to the pyrolysis temperature. Further, the volatile matter content of pellets shows a linear correlation with the FR value, whereas no clear relation is found in the case of the pellet's mechanical strength.","The study involves lab-scale rapid pyrolysis of waste plastic (polyethylene) in Refuse Derived Fuel pellets, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of fragmentation behavior."
"Effect of calcium on synergy evolution mechanism of Zhundong coal and polyethylene co-pyrolysis The effect of calcium on the synergy evolution mechanism of Zhundong coal and polyethylene (PE) co-pyrolysis was explored by thermogravimetric (TG), fixed-bed experiments, and the ReaxFF simulation method. The weight loss characteristics of coal and PE pyrolysis, obtained through ReaxFF simulations, exhibited good agreement with TG experimental results. The distribution of coal/PE co-pyrolysis products was examined via fixed-bed fast pyrolysis experiments and Reaxff isothermal pyrolysis simulation. The results reveal that calcium substantially reduces co-pyrolysis tar while simultaneously enhancing co-pyrolysis char and gas to varying extents. Besides, the experimental temperature of 973 K and the simulated temperature of 2600 K yield the highest decrease in co-pyrolysis tar, with reductions of 9.52 % and 14.03 %, respectively. It is discovered that the addition of calcium enhances the synergy degree to 100 % between coal and PE molecules, which means that coal molecules become more firmly attached to PE molecular fragments. Additionally, calcium induces polymerization in co-pyrolysis char, causing the char molecules to become larger and increasing their average molecular weight. Ca-containing tars are rich in aliphatic hydrogens, and synergistic molecules prefer light tars, whereas Ca-free tars have a slightly broader range of aromatic hydrogens, and synergistic molecules favor heavy tars, indicating that the addition of calcium may promote the ring-opening process of coal molecules, releasing more branched-chain hydrogen. In the Ca-free and Ca-containing systems, 24.67 % and 29.51 % of the hydrogen content of the coal molecules migrated toward the co-pyrolysis tar, respectively. The proportion of coal tar fragments decreases while the proportion of PE tar and synergistic tar fragments increases in Ca-containing tar when compared to Ca-free tar, indicating that calcium promotes the polymerization of coal tar molecules with PE tar molecules, which leads to larger char molecules and smaller gas molecules.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed experiments on co-pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) and coal, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of products."
"Fast co-pyrolysis of low density polyethylene and biomass residue for oil production Co-pyrolysis of low density polyethylene (LDPE) with three kinds of biomass was performed in a dropdown tube reactor. The synergistic effect was investigated by comparing the experimental relative yield and characteristics of oil with the calculated ones based on the results from the pyrolysis of the individual components in the mixture. It is found that the maximum oil relative yield in the case of co-pyrolysis process was obtained at 600°C, which was significantly higher than the optimum temperature of biomass or LDPE pyrolysized alone. Although the inorganic elements in biomass improved the decomposition of LDPE, more organics with larger molecule weight (>C12) were produced due to the further reaction between the decomposition products from LDPE and biomass. The synergistic effect was positive for the production of aliphatic compounds. However, it could be positive or negative for the production of aromatic compounds, which depended on the type of biomass in the feedstock. The significant removal of aldehydes, acids, ethers, furans, ketones, phenols and sugars from the final co-pyrolysis oil, in which there was a significant increase of alcohols, was achieved.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (LDPE) with biomass in a tube reactor, reports measurable product yields and oil composition, and includes experimental characterization of the co-pyrolysis process."
"Fluidized bed pyrolysis of a recycled polyethylene Fluidized bed pyrolysis is a special class of feedstock recycling processes for plastics recycling which provides for a rather uniform spectrum of products, reduces the maintenance time and cost and gives the possibility to apply the process even on a relatively small scale. The present study describes investigations carried out by injecting recycled polyethylene in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor, batchwise or continuously operated. The batchwise experiments allowed to investigate the polymer-to-particles interactions inside the fluidized bed reactor, which strongly affect the phenomenology and the rate of polymer degradation. The continuous experiments indicated how the yield and the composition of products are affected by two key operating variables of the process: the bed temperature and the residence time in the reactor.","The study involves lab-scale fluidized bed pyrolysis of recycled polyethylene, with measurable product yields and composition analyzed as functions of temperature and residence time."
"Waste artificial marble pyrolysis and hydrolysis Artificial marble, a composite material consisting of 40 % (g g−1) Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and 60 % (g g−1) aluminium hydroxide Al(OH)3 , combines the durability and aesthetics of real marble with the lightweight and moldability of plastic. It is the most sought-after synthetic stone in the world, with a production volume of over 1 million t in 2021. However, due to a high level of cross-linking, mechanical recycling of the composite is impossible, while chemical recycling is achievable, yet unprofitable. The only economically viable recycling solution is to retain the value of both the organic and inorganic fraction of the composite. We investigated the pyrolysis and hydrolysis of post-consumer end-of-life artificial marble to identify possible valorization routes, examining the effects of temperature, water content, catalyst presence, and heating style. Temperature directly accelerates thermolysis, and indirectly hydrolysis. The water inherently present in Al(OH)3 drives initial hydrolysis, and temperature expedites inorganic fraction dehydration, increasing local water partial pressure near polymer ester sites. Above 350°C, PMMAeq depolymerizes faster than it hydrolyzes, balancing the effects of temperature on water dehydration with the depletion of available ester sites for hydrolysis. Contrary to intuition, PMMA does not depolymerize to its monomer MMA and then hydrolyze its acid (methacrylic acid); instead, PMMA partially hydrolyzes to poly methacrylic acid (PMAA) while also depolymerizing to MMA. PMAA then dehydrates and degrades, releasing CO and CO2. The optimal method involves a heating ramp that first releases water at 300°C, minimizing hydrolysis, and then favors MMA production at 400°C, achieving a 66 % (g g−1) MMA yield. Regardless of the operative conditions, the inorganic fraction transforms from Al(OH)3 to a γ -alumina precursor, boehmite. Additionally, the remaining polymer in the residue, about 9 % (g g−1), has the required heat capacity for an energy-self sufficient calcination to γ -alumina. This dual-phase process not only maximizes MMA recovery but also retains the value of the inorganic fraction, providing a sustainable and economically viable recycling method for artificial marble.","The study investigates pyrolysis of waste artificial marble containing PMMA, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields (66% MMA), temperature-dependent product analysis, and reactor condition optimization."
"Light olefins from HDPE cracking in a two-step thermal and catalytic process The continuous catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out in a two-step reaction system involving a pyrolysis conical spouted bed reactor followed by a catalytic fixed bed reactor. The good performance of the conical spouted bed reactor has allowed using a low temperature in thermal cracking (500°C) without defluidization problems, obtaining a volatile stream with a 90wt.% overall yield of C12–C20 and waxes in the first step. The effect of the second-step operating conditions on product yields and composition has been studied using a catalyst based on a HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 =30) zeolite. The influence of temperature in the 350–550°C range and space–time in the 0–8gcat min gHDPE −1 range has been studied. An increase in temperature or space–time gives way to an increase in the yield of light olefins, reaching a value of 62.9wt.% at 550°C and 8 gcat min gHDPE −1, with the individual yields of ethylene, propylene and butenes being 10.6, 35.6 and 16.7wt.%, respectively. Although the yield of single-ring aromatics increases when both variables studied are increased, the maximum yield obtained was lower than 13wt.%. The yield of waxes (the main product in the first step) is negligible even at low temperatures or spaces-times, which evidences the efficiency of the catalytic step.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE in a two-step reactor system with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Two-stage pyrolysis of polystyrene: Pyrolysis oil as a source of fuels or benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes The recycling rate of plastic waste needs to be improved worldwide. In that context, pyrolysis, through which petrochemical feedstock and alternative fuel can be obtained, has received significant attention. In this study, pyrolysis of polystyrene was conducted in a continuous two-stage process that has an auger reactor and a fluidized bed reactor connected in series. The main objective was to produce oils rich in benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes instead of typical polystyrene pyrolysis oils, which contain high amounts of styrene monomers with low thermal-oxidative stability. The effects of different reaction temperatures (in both reactors) and the type of fluidizing medium on the product distribution and composition were investigated. The maximum yield of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (26.3 wt%) was obtained at a temperature of 780 °C in the fluidized bed reactor. The oil and styrene yields at 780 °C were 86 and 26 wt%, respectively. To evaluate the fuel properties of the pyrolysis oil, its calorific value, API gravity, viscosity, density, ash content, pour point, flash point, and pH were examined. The results indicate that the pyrolysis oil can be both a good source of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes and can potentially be used as a substitute source to gasoline or diesel fuels when it is mixed with oils with a low aromatic content.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polystyrene waste in a two-stage reactor system with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and fuel property analysis."
"Pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading of brominated high impact polystyrene over Fe and Ni modified catalysts: Influence of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 catalysts The pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process of brominated high impact polystyrene (Br-HIPS) was performed using Fe and Ni modified ZSM-5 and MCM-41 catalysts in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. The characterization of catalysts, the product yield and debromination performance in relation to different catalysts were investigated. The results showed that the addition of HZSM-5 and MCM-41 reduced the yield of oil from 69.0 wt % to 64.4 wt % and 62.3 wt %, respectively. The modified catalysts of Fe/ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5 exhibited prominent cracking performance, resulting in the decrease of the oil to 63.2 wt % and 61.2 wt %, respectively, corresponding with an increase of gas products from 7.7 wt % to 16.1 wt % and 20.3 wt %, respectively. However, the mesoporous catalysts of Fe/MCM-41 and Ni/MCM-41 tended to preserve the yield of oil to 65.9 wt % and 65.3 wt %, respectively. In terms of the composition of the oils, a higher yield of single ring aromatics was obtained with Fe modified catalysts, while the addition of ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts promoted increased formation of 2 ring aromatics at the expense of single ring aromatics. In addition, the modified catalysts were found to be highly effective at removing bromine from the oils. The Fe modified catalysts exhibited a better debromination performance than Ni modified catalysts, which was in favor of capturing more inorganic bromine and removing bromine from the oils.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of brominated high impact polystyrene (a waste plastic) using fixed-bed reactors with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Degradation of LDPE/VGO mixtures to fuels using a FCC equilibrium catalyst in a sand fluidized bed reactor Plastic degradation for recovery of useful products or raw materials is a very interesting alternative for reducing the plastic accumulation. This paper explores the possibility of using refinery facilities to carry out the plastic cracking as well as to take the most of the products obtained. In the present work, LDPE/VGO blends with different percentages of polymer are degraded in presence of a FCC equilibrium catalyst. The reactor used in this study is a laboratory scale sand fluidized bed reactor at 500°C, and a 7:1 catalyst:LDPE/VGO blend ratio in order to simulate the operating conditions in a large scale industrial reactor. Polyethylene blends evaluated show relative proportions of LDPE of 0, 6, 25, 75 and 100% (w/w). Gas and liquid compounds were collected and quantified. The results obtained are compared with those generated in a thermal cracking. In all cases, the FCC equilibrium catalyst showed a high selectivity to the production of isobutane and isopentane in the volatile compounds as well as to aromatics in the liquid products. Results shown in this paper evidences the viability of introducing plastics into FCC unit, producing potential valuable products from low value materials.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of LDPE (a waste plastic) in a sand fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data.
"Production of oil with low organobromine content from the pyrolysis of flame retarded HIPS and ABS plastics Pyrolysis of flame retarded plastics often leads to high concentrations of toxic organobromine compounds in the pyrolysis oil. In this work, we have investigated the pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) over long residence times in a tube reactor with the aim of producing an oil that is free from organobromines. The tube reactor was fitted with a distillation column so that the pyrolysis products could be separated into heavy oil, middle distillate, light oil, and gases. The light pyrolysis products were characterised using GC–MS and GC-FID/ECD, while the total bromine content of the oils was determined by bomb calorimetery. The bromine content of heavy fractions and antimony content of all fractions of pyrolysis (light oil, middle distillates, heavy oil and char) was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic adsorption spectroscopy (ICP-AAS). Heavy oil fractions were characterised using Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDAX), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) techniques. It was found that the light oil produced by the pyrolysis of both flame retarded HIPS and flame retarded ABS mostly consisted of toluene, ethylbenzene, and cumene and had a relatively low bromine content, all of which was inorganic. The middle distillate oils produced by the same plastics had much higher bromine content, but the vast majority of the bromine was inorganic in the form of antimony bromide. The average molecular weights of heavy fractions were affected by the cracking temperature, while the structure of the mentioned fractions did not change considerably with temperature. Light oil fractions had very low amount of contaminants (bromine and antimony), while heavy oils contained them in enormous concentrations.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (HIPS and ABS) with measurable product yields, detailed analytical characterization, and explicit experimental data on bromine and antimony content in fractions."
"Sustainable management of medical plastic waste through carbon dioxide-assisted pyrolysis To address the challenges associated with medical plastic waste and to characterize its heterogeneity, non-recyclability, and potential biohazard risks, this study explored a carbon dioxide (CO2)-assisted pyrolysis process as a sustainable disposal method. Medical plastic waste typically includes polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride. To experimentally evaluate the functional reactivity of CO2, we employed three pyrolysis setups (one-stage, two-stage, and catalytic processes). The technical advantages of using CO2 over inert gases such as nitrogen (N2) were demonstrated through pyrolysis tests. The results showed that energy production was enhanced under CO2 conditions, with catalytic pyrolysis generating 146% more flammable gases compared to pyrolysis in an N2 environment. The use of CO2 also led to a reduction in the formation of toxic chemicals due to improved thermal cracking. The CO2-assisted pyrolysis process exhibited net negative CO2 emissions when a catalyst was present, as a substantial amount of CO2 was consumed during the process. In conclusion, CO2-assisted pyrolysis of medical plastic waste offers a sustainable management solution that maximizes the utilization of carbon resources.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of medical plastic waste (PP, PS, PVC) using CO2-assisted processes with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Sustainable production of aromatics via catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins towards the carbon cycle for plastics Catalytic pyrolysis has been emerging as a promising chemical recycling technology to convert plastic waste into olefins and aromatics that can be used as alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals and promote the carbon cycle for plastics. However, the above procedure typically suffers from poor selectivity of the target product. Herein, catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin plastics was carried out in a two-stage fixed bed reactor for highly selective production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), over Zn-P/HZSM-5 catalysts. After loading 3.0 wt% Zn and 0.5 wt% P on HZSM-5 catalyst, catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 500 °C achieved the highest liquid yield of 55.9 wt% and exhibited a remarkably high selectivity up to 87.44 % towards MAHs, especially in which the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) content reached 75.16 %. The introduced Zn species decreased Brønsted acid sites while increased Lewis acid sites of HZSM-5, which in turn improved the aromatization activity. Simultaneously, the addition of P decreased the acidity strength, inhibiting the formation of coke and polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons. Furthermore, catalytic co-pyrolysis of LDPE, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were investigated to reveal the synergistic effect in terms of BTEX selectivity. Intriguingly, a high liquid yield of 55.7 wt% can be obtained at a feeding ratio of HDPE:LDPE:PP = 1:1:1, and an enhanced selectivity of MAHs up to 87.66 % was achieved, with the highest BTEX content of 79.89 %. Finally, carbon emission assessments of catalytic plastic pyrolysis indicated that it presented great potential to reduce carbon emission and facilitate carbon cycle.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (LDPE, HDPE, PP) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product selectivity, and catalyst performance data."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of black-liquor lignin by co-feeding with different plastics in a fluidized bed reactor Catalytic co-pyrolysis of black-liquor lignin and waste plastics (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene PP; polystyrene, PS) was conducted in a fluidized bed. The effects of temperature, plastic to lignin ratio, catalyst and plastic types on product distributions were studied. Both aromatic and olefin yields increased with increasing PE proportion. Petrochemical yield of co-pyrolysis of PE and lignin was LOSA-1>spent FCC>Gamma-Al2O3 >sand. The petrochemical yield with LOSA-1 is 43.9% which is more than two times of that without catalyst. The feedstock for co-pyrolysis with lignin is polystyrene>polyethylene>polypropylene. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of black-liquor lignin with PS produced the maximum aromatic yield (55.3%), while co-pyrolysis with PE produced the maximum olefin yield (13%).","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS) in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Synergistic effects of CO2 on complete thermal degradation of plastic waste mixture through a catalytic pyrolysis platform: A case study of disposable diaper Consumption of diverse plastics has posed an environmental threat because their disposal practices, landfilling and incineration, release toxic chemicals and microplastics into all environmental media. Indeed, heterogeneous matrix of plastic wastes makes them hard to be disposed. As such, this study aimed to introduce an environmentally benign/reliable disposal platform for complete decomposition of plastic wastes. Pyrolysis process was adapted to convert plastics into syngas, and a disposable diaper (DD) was used as model plastic waste, because it is composed of a variety of polymeric materials. Pyrolysis of DD resulted in the formation of gaseous products and pyrogenic oils, composed of (oxygenated) hydrocarbons. Nonetheless, reactivity of CO2 as an oxidant in pyrolysis of DD was negligible. To impart the strong/desired reactivity of CO2, Ni-based catalyst was adopted. Ni catalyst enhanced H2 and CO formations 4 and 15 times more than pyrolysis without catalyst at 700 °C under CO2. The value-added syngas production was originated from the reduction of polymeric waste, and its derivatives including aromatic compounds. Thus, CO2 offered a strategic means to produce value-added chemicals and reduce aromaticity of pyrogenic products. The observations could offer an innovative way to control the fate of toxic chemicals derived from plastic pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of a mixed plastic waste (disposable diaper) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Study on pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of mixed waste plastics under different atmospheres The Thermochemical method (pyrolysis) is the most promising means to treat waste plastics, which can be converted into high value-added products with significant economic and social benefits. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of single/mixed plastics under different atmospheres (nitrogen, carbon dioxide) were explored, and two kinetic models (KAS method and Friedman method) were used to calculate the kinetic parameters. The experimental results showed that carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere can reduce the pyrolysis temperature of plastics. At the same time, the activation energy of single plastics under carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere was lower than that of nitrogen atmosphere (N2), with a decrease of about 7–60 kJ/mol, and the activation energy calculation results of mixed plastics were roughly similar. There was a positive synergistic effect between the mixed plastics under N2 atmosphere, and the activation energy decreased from 234 kJ/mol to 221 kJ/mol, with a decrease of about 6%. There was a negative synergistic effect between the mixed plastics under CO2 atmosphere, and the activation energy increased from 206 kJ/mol to 219 kJ/mol, with an increase of about 6%. The theoretical TG curve method also obtained similar conclusions. This experimental investigation can provide theoretical support for the environmentally friendly recycling technology of plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics under different atmospheres, with measurable experimental data including activation energy, temperature effects, and product yield relationships."
"Production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels through catalytic cracking of high and low-density polyethylene medical wastes using fly ash as a catalyst This study explores the potential of converting High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) waste into liquid hydrocarbon fuels through catalytic degradation using fly ash. It achieves significant conversion rates, with HDPE reaching over 95% total conversion and a 66.4% oil yield at a catalyst-to-polymer ratio of 0.20, while LDPE shows a 100% conversion rate at ratios of 0.15 and 0.20. The process not only yields hydrocarbons with decreasing density and increasing calorific values, up to 55 MJ/kg for HDPE and 47 MJ/kg for LDPE at optimal conditions but also produces fractions with properties similar to diesel, notably in terms of density and viscosity. The flashpoint and fire point values further affirm these products' potential as viable fuel sources, aligning closely with diesel standards. 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis reveals a composition rich in long-chain alkanes and alkenes, indicating the efficient transformation of plastic waste into valuable energy resources. This research presents a promising avenue for recycling plastic waste into alternative fuels, highlighting a sustainable approach to waste management and energy recovery.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE and LDPE plastics, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Energy recovery from pyrolysis of plastic waste: Study on non-recycled plastics (NRP) data as the real measure of plastic waste Oil produced from pyrolysis of plastics have been known for its higher calorific value than wood-based oil, in which comparable to conventional diesel. Even though many studies have been conducted on pyrolysis of plastics, the findings of those studies are not applied and reported yet according to the real portion of plastic waste. The real amount of plastic waste available is mainly derived from non-recycled plastics (NRP). NRP is defined as the plastic waste that remain in the recycling centers, which unable to be processed due to the certain restrictions. The amounts of NRP vary for each country based on daily applications. In this study, data of NRP in Malaysia, US, UK, as well as global were used to investigate the potential production of liquid fuel based on their different composition of plastic waste. Pyrolysis was conducted in a fixed bed reactor at 500°C with nitrogen flow of 200ml/min for 30min reaction time. The addition of polystyrene (PS) into the NRP composition was also studied to evaluate the improvement of the liquid quality. Several important findings were discussed in this paper including some technical problems, features of the liquid product, characteristics of the by-products and potential energy recovery from NRP. The liquid product was analyzed by various methods such as FTIR, GCMS, elemental analysis and water content.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of non-recycled plastic waste (NRP) with measurable yields, reactor conditions, and product characterization using GC-MS, FTIR, and elemental analysis."
"Kinetic Model of the Chemical Recycling of Waste Polyethylene into Fuels Tertiary recycling methods offer potential possibilities for the utilization of waste plastics. Thermal and catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene wastes were studied in a batch reactor under mild cracking conditions to derive liquid cracking products of olefins and paraffins. Zeolite catalysts with different activities were studied: a commercial equilibrium FCC catalyst, an H form ZSM-5 catalyst, and a natural clinoptilolite containing rhyolite tuff. The catalytic processes could convert waste polymers into valuable hydrocarbons. The properties of products could be modified by the use of catalysts. The olefin content and the position of the olefinic double bonds were investigated with IR spectrometry. In the presence of catalysts the olefin content increased, and the terminal bonds migrated into internal positions. Furthermore the liquid products had lower average molecular weights than those obtained without catalysts. The activation energies of the cracking reactions with or without catalysts were determined. The apparent activation energy was lower in catalytic than that in thermal degradation. The cracking reaction rates were modelled and the reaction rate constant of each hydrocarbon type was calculated. The model gives a good approximation of the experimental results obtained from the degradation of LDPE waste in the presence and absence of catalysts. Under the studied parameters, liquids were formed with suitable properties for further uses (e.g. low sulphur content, low pour point).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste low-density polyethylene in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, activation energies, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of wood-plastic composite waste over activated carbon catalyst for aromatics production: Effect of preparation process of activated carbon In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of a corn stalk/high-density polyethylene composite for aromatics production over activated carbon in a fixed-bed reactor was investigated. The effects of the carbonization temperature and H3PO4 impregnation ratio on the product distributions were studied. Increasing the H3PO4 impregnation ratio (0–2.0) and carbonization temperature (600–750 °C) was found to enhance the selectivity of aromatics. When the activated carbon was synthesized using an H3PO4 impregnation ratio of 1:1 and a carbonization temperature of 700 °C, the yield of aromatics reached a maximum of 86.11% and the selectivity of mono-aromatics reached 64.01%. Moreover, the catalytic performances of biochars obtained at various carbonization temperatures were also studied. No significant catalytic activity of biochar for the formation of aromatics was observed due to the absence of P-containing active functional groups. This work provides an approach for the conversion of wood-plastic composite waste into valuable aromatic production using a low-cost activated carbon catalyst.",The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE in a wood-plastic composite using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data.
"Total utilization of waste tire rubber through pyrolysis to obtain oils and CO2 activation of pyrolysis char Waste tire rubber (WTR) was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor in the final temperature range of 500–800°C. Pyrolysis oils were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Pyrolysis chars obtained were activated using CO2 at a final temperature of 950°C with a final activation time of 1–3h. In addition, the influence of the acid treatment of pyrolysis char on the physicochemical properties was investigated. In the experiments, the yields of pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis char were 30–38 and about 37wt.%, respectively. The pyrolysis oils consisted mainly of limonene, aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, and some heteroatom-containing compounds, such as benzothiazole and 2,4-dimethylquinoline. The sulfur contents of the pyrolysis oils were 0.85–0.96wt.%. Most of the sulfur remained in the pyrolysis char. The maximum surface area of the activated char obtained by CO2 activation was 437m2/g. The acid treatment of the pyrolysis char decreased the ash and sulfur contents, which supported the strong potential of the acid-treated char for use in commercial applications.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tire rubber (a plastic waste material) in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and activation experiments yielding quantifiable results."
"The effect of thermal aging on the composition of pyrolysis oil fuel derived from typical waste plastics This study reveals the influence of thermal aging on the pyrolysis oil fuel components of typical waste plastics, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Plastic samples were continuously heated in an aging oven at 100 °C to simulate thermal aging. The pyrolysis volatile compositions of fresh and aged plastic samples were comparatively studied by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) at 500 °C. The volatile composition analysis results showed that thermal aging changes the pyrolysis oil composition, and the influence strongly depends on the type of plastic. For PE and PP, which underwent random scission after thermal aging treatment, the influence of thermal aging on the heavy oil fraction was more obvious than that on the light oil and diesel oil fractions. For PVC samples, the thermal aging process caused structural defects and turned the color of the PVC light yellow. After 128-h thermal aging, the maximum weight loss rate decreased by 35.8%, and the fraction of C5-C9 components and aromatics first increased and then decreased. The maximum values were 80.21 ± 1.62% and 73.69 ± 0.73%, and the minimum values were 65.58 ± 2.63% and 63.98 ± 0.39%, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PVC) with measurable product composition data obtained via Py-GC/MS and quantified yield changes due to thermal aging."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of petroleum-based and biodegradable plastic waste to obtain high-value chemicals The petroleum-based plastics, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP), and the biodegradable plastic, polylactide (PLA) were processed by thermal and catalytic pyrolysis to investigate their suitability as feedstock for chemical recycling. The influence of pyrolysis temperature (400–600 °C) and catalyst (zeolite, spent FCC, and MgO catalyst) on the pyrolysis liquid composition and yield was studied. The studied petroleum-based plastics had similar decomposition temperature ranges but produced their highest pyrolysis yields at different temperatures. Pyrolysis liquids from thermal degradation of HDPE and LDPE consisted high yield of waxes but those of PP and PLA consisted of both waxes and liquid oil. Catalysts affected not only the pyrolysis yield, but also the proportions of liquid oil and wax in pyrolysis liquids. Alkenes, alkanes, and aromatics were the main compounds in the pyrolysis liquids. Spent FCC catalyst reduced the production of waxes and increased the production of gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. MgO catalyst led to high coke formation from polyolefins and PLA. Lactic acid, lactide and propanoic acid were examples of valuable chemicals recovered from the pyrolysis of PLA. Lactide was the main product (up to 79%) of catalytic pyrolysis with zeolite at 400 °C. Spent FCC catalyst produced mostly propanoic acid at 400 °C but at 600 °C, L-lactic acid became the most abundant compound.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PLA) with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Selective recycling of BTX hydrocarbons from electronic plastic wastes using catalytic fast pyrolysis Non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of two waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) fractions, with two different copper contents (low- and medium-grade WEEE named as LGE and MGE, respectively), were performed using micro- and lab-scale pyrolyzers. This research aimed to fundamentally study the feasibility of chemical recycling of the WEEE fractions via pyrolysis process considering molecular interactions at the interfaces of catalyst active sites and WEEE pyrolyzates which significantly influence the chemical functionality of surface intermediates and catalysis by reorganizing the pyrolyzates near catalytic active sites forming reactive surface intermediates. Hence, Al2O3, TiO2, HBeta, HZSM-5 and spent FCC catalysts were used in in-situ micro-scale pyrolysis. Results indicated that HBeta and HZSM-5 zeolites were more suitable than other catalysts for selective production of aromatic hydrocarbons and BTX. High acidity and shape selectivity of zeotype surfaces make them attractive frameworks for catalytic pyrolysis processes aiming for light hydrocarbons like BTX. Meanwhile, the ex-situ pyrolysis of LGE and MGE were carried out using HZSM-5 in micro- and lab-scale pyrolyzers to investigate the effect of pyrolysis configuration on the BTX selectivity. Although the ex-situ pyrolysis resulted in higher formation of BTX from LGE, the in-situ configuration was more efficient to produce BTX from MGE.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste electrical and electronic equipment containing plastic materials, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of BTX hydrocarbons."
"Pyrolysis of fibre residues with plastic contamination from a paper recycling mill: Energy recoveries Pyrolysis is a promising technology for the production of marketable energy products from waste mixtures, as it decomposes heterogeneous material into homogenous fuel products. This research assessed the ability of slow pyrolysis to convert three waste streams, composed of fibre residues contaminated with different plastic mixtures, into char and tarry phase products at three different temperatures (300, 425 and 550°C). The products were characterised in terms of mass yield, higher heating value (HHV) and gross energy conversion (EC). Significant amounts of hydrocarbon plastics in the feed materials increased the calorific values of the char (up to 32.9MJ/kg) and tarry phase (up to 42.8MJ/kg) products, comparable to high volatile bituminous A coal and diesel respectively. For all three waste streams converted at 300°C, the majority of the energy in the feedstock was recovered in the char product (>80%), while deoxygenation of fibre component resulted in char with increased calorific value (up to 31.6MJ/kg) being produced. Pyrolysis at 425°C for two of the waste streams containing significant amounts of plastic produced both a valuable char and tarry phase, which resulted in an EC greater than 74%. Full conversion of plastic at 550°C increased the tarry phase yield but dramatically decreased the char HHV. The influence of temperature on product yield and HHV was discussed based on the pyrolysis mechanisms and in relation to the plastic composition of the waste streams.","The study involves lab-scale slow pyrolysis of plastic-contaminated fibre residues, reports measurable product yields and higher heating values at specific temperatures, and includes experimental characterization of char and tarry phase products."
"The influence of the waste ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer on the thermal degradation of the waste polypropylene The pyrolysis of the waste polypropylene (PP), the waste ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and their blends has been carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C. The effect of different ratios of the waste EVA in the waste PP/EVA blends on the thermal degradation of the waste PP was investigated in terms of both product distributions and liquid fuel properties. The compositions of pyrolysis products were characterized in detail. The liquid products from the pyrolysis of the waste PP, the waste EVA and their blends were analyzed using different analytical techniques and fuel properties of pyrolytic liquids were investigated in comparison with commercial diesel. There were no synergistic effects between products from the waste PP and products from the waste EVA. While the ratio of the waste EVA increased in the waste PP/EVA blends, aromatic content of the pyrolytic liquids increased and subsequently paraffinic content of the pyrolytic liquids decreased. In addition, the boiling point distributions of pyrolytic liquids derived from the waste PP/EVA blends were found to be similar for all tested ratios of the waste PP/EVA blends.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastics (PP and EVA) with measurable product yields, detailed product composition analysis, and fuel property comparisons."
"Pyrolysis of typical plastics and coupled with steam reforming of their derived volatiles for simultaneous production of hydrogen-rich gases and heavy organics Pyrolysis is a thermochemical route for converting waste plastics into hydrocarbons that might be further upgraded to fine chemicals via the process such as hydrotreatment. In this study, the pyrolysis of five typical plastics (PE, PP, PVC, PS and PET) and steam reforming of their derived volatiles were coupled in one process, named as pyro-reforming. The reaction behaviors, especially the property of their derived cokes, in the pyro-reforming were investigated. The results indicated that the volatiles from the pyrolysis of PE had the highest reactivity with steam to produce H2 of the highest yield, followed by that of PP, PVC, PET and PS. The Cl in PVC promoted nickel sintering, enhanced formation of heavy aromatics through aromatization. Moreover, the existence of Cl interrupted formation of carbon nanotube, forming the highest amount of coke with hemp rope-like fiber form of very coarse surface. This was very different from the carbon nanotube form of coke with smooth surface and uniform outer/inner diameters from the pyro-reforming of PE or PP. The pyro-reforming of PET or PS generated mainly the aromatic intermediates that were chemically more inert in steam reforming, forming polymeric type of coke with no carbon nanotube morphology and very low crystallinity.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of typical waste plastics (PE, PP, PVC, PS, PET) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of coke and gas composition."
"Untangling the role of the organosilane functional groups in the synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite by crystallization of silanized protozeolitic units Crystallization of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite has been performed under hydrothermal conditions from silanized protozeolitic units. The role of amine and phenyl groups present in the organosilanes, as well as the use of dipodal silanization agents, on the creation of mesoporosity in the zeolite samples has been investigated. The presence of amine groups and dipodal moieties in the organosilane increases their interactions with the protozeolitic nanounits in the gel, which results in hierarchical zeolites showing enhanced secondary porosity and a higher degree of modification of the textural properties. Nevertheless, dipodal organosilanes hinder strongly the aggregation of the nanounits, leading to non-completely crystalline materials. In contrast, the combination of phenyl and amine groups into a single organosilane has shown to be effective for the generation of more uniform mesopores. Thus, N-(2-N-Benzylaminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Ph-2A) has been found as the best silanization agent, affording a hierarchical zeolite with a narrow mesopore size distribution and a high concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites. Moreover, during LDPE catalytic cracking in TGA tests, the latter material allowed the conversion of the polymer to occur in a narrow temperature range as a consequence of its more uniform acid and textural properties. Likewise, this sample exhibited a high activity in LDPE cracking at 340 °C using a laboratory scale reaction system to produce mainly gasoline-range hydrocarbons and light olefins.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE using hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, with measurable product yields and catalytic performance data reported."
"In-depth understanding of the synergistic effect in catalytic copyrolysis of lignin-plastic mixtures with lignin-tailored hierarchical HZSM‑5 catalysts To overcome the diffusion limitations of DZSM-5 and increase the yield of hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil, a structurally tailored hierarchical catalyst was synthesized via alkaline treatment and waste biomass-derived lignin-assisted reassembly. The physicochemical properties, such as the crystallinity, porosity, acidity and morphology, were characterized with various methods. The catalytic activities were evaluated with various lignin doping contents and lignin-to-LDPE ratios. Additionally, the product distributions, reaction mechanisms and reusability were also investigated. A detailed experiment suggested that lignin significantly increased the porosity of the hierarchical catalyst and led to the formation of a well-developed micro-mesoporous structure via lignin doping reassembly, which facilitated the passage of pyrolysis volatiles. Additionally, the increased porosity and intracrystalline mesoporosity of the material resulted in excellent dehydrogenation, decarbonylation and β-O-4 cleavage activities. Lower lignin doping levels produced olefins and alkylbenzenes and inhibited PAH formation; in contrast, higher lignin loadings facilitated aromatics and BTXE formation. A synergistic effect between the lignin and LDPE was observed for HCs formation with enhanced hydrogen transfer and Diels-Alder reactions. The optimal 0.50 % C@DZSM-5 exhibited excellent catalytic activity, with a hydrocarbon yield of 71.29 % and an olefin selectivity of 30.78 % at a lignin-to-LDPE ratio of 1:1. Furthermore, 0.50 % C@DZSM-5 exhibited good reusability and stability after three runs, and ∼95 % of the content was maintained. The micropore specific surface area coverage and micropore volume blockage were the main reasons for catalyst deactivation.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE mixed with lignin using a hierarchically structured catalyst, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of reaction products and mechanisms."
"Specialized fractionation combined with deep analytics of waste plastic cracking oils for petrochemical operations Waste plastic cracking oils (WPCO) are currently being considered as potential green feedstock for petrochemical/refinery industries in order to promote chemical recycling. However, the WPCO is a very complex material that does not meet the limits of petrochemical processes. In order to assess the possibility of using WPCO as raw material, a comprehensive analytical characterization and distillation of two wide-boiling WPCO samples from the industry was performed. Fractions boiling in typical ranges were prepared: naphtha (30–180 °C), heavy naphtha (30–250 °C), middle distillate (180–350 °C), and atmospheric residue (> 350 °C). Moreover, other distillation cuts were prepared by distilling every 10 wt% as a separate fraction. We performed a study on the distribution of parameters in narrow fractions. The content of aromatics increased with the boiling temperature in the cases of WPCO-1, but decreased for WPCO-2. WPCO-2 had lower alkanes and final boiling point (FBP) compared to WPCO-1. None of the distillation cuts are suitable for “stand-alone” processing on the steam-cracker without additional treatment. However, some of the obtained fractions could be co-processed with a standard feedstock. This study brings an understanding of WPCO material and the possibilities and limitations of its use as petrochemical input.","The abstract describes lab-scale experimental work on waste plastic cracking oils (WPCO) derived from plastic pyrolysis, including distillation, analytical characterization, and measurable product yields and composition data."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of oxygen-containing waste polycarbonate for the preparation of carbon nanotubes and H2-rich syngas In this study, ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of oxygen-containing polycarbonate (PC) was conducted to prepare carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and H2-rich syngas. This study examined the influence of the active metal components (Ni and Fe), catalyst pre-reduction, and pre-deoxygenation of pyrolysis volatiles on the catalytic performance and mechanism. Results show that the reductive constituents in pyrolysis volatiles make it difficult to reduce the Fe oxides, thus hindering the CNTs growth on Fe catalysts, compared to Ni catalysts. H2 pre-reduction of Ni and Fe catalysts enhances the generation of CNTs and syngas. The pre-reduced Fe catalyst exhibits better carbon deposit performance, reaching 263 mg/gplastics. The pre-reduced Ni catalyst better facilitates the reforming reaction of CO2 and H2O, resulting in higher syngas yields of 32.75 mmol/gplastics, with a volume proportion of 94.4 vol%. The addition of the deoxygenation catalyst Ni/HZSM-5 promotes the growth of CNTs with fewer defects and higher graphitization on Ni catalysts. The excess CO2 and H2O generated by the introduction of Ni/HZSM-5 may oxidize the Fe0 on pre-reduced Fe catalysts, inhibiting the growth of CNTs. The mechanism of the growth of CNTs and syngas from PC is also explored. The findings can provide theoretical guidance for the disposal of waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polycarbonate (a commercial plastic) with measurable yields of CNTs and syngas, catalyst performance data, and product characterization."
"Tetravalent metals modulated Zn-based layered double hydroxides and their mixed metal oxides for catalytic depolymerization of carbonyl-coordinating plastic waste Plastic waste generation has become a global issue and presents a significant challenge concerning degradability in the environment. This poses a serious threat and adverse impact on the health of living creature and the environment ecosystem. The up-/re-cycling of plastic waste through catalytic depolymerization is becoming a sustainable way to reduce economic concerns about production and serious environmental impacts. Here, in the present study an effort has been made for the development of catalysts for efficient recycling of carbonyl group containing polymer waste [Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polycarbonate (PC)]. The sequential preparation of ZnMIV- and ZnAlMIV- LDHs (layered double hydroxides) (MIV= Zr and Ti) and their respective mixed metal oxide (MMOs) based catalytic materials, has been carried out by one-pot co-precipitation and calcination methods. The structural parameters were examined through the various characterisation techniques including XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, and EDS. The layered structure, high crystalline nature and hexagonal 2D-sheet/flakes like morphology with average particle size ranging from ∼14–51 nm [for LDHs] and ∼6–21 nm [for MMOs] were observed. Depolymerization of PET and PC using LDHs/MMOs catalyst in ethylene glycols (EG) produced bis(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET) and bisphenol A (BPA) monomers as main products, respectively. The catalyst quantity, concentration of solvent, recyclability of catalysts, reaction duration, and crystallization time have also been further investigated for better yield during catalytic glycolysis. The isolated monomers were further characterized by using melting point, mass spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and FTIR analysis. The order of catalytic activities of prepared samples as ZnTi-LDH˃ ZnAlTi-LDH ˃ ZnTi-MMO˃ ZnAlZr-LDH˃ ZnAlTi-MMO˃ ZnZr-LDH in PET depolymerization while in case of PC, the order as ZnTi-LDH˃ ZnAlTi-LDH ˃ ZnZr-LDH˃ ZnAlZr-LDH˃ ZnZr-MMO˃ ZnAlZr-MMO˃ ZnTi-MMO˃ ZnAlTi-MMO were observed. LDH samples showed higher catalytic conversion than their respective MMOs during PET and PC depolymerization into monomers BHET and BPA with % yield of ∼76–83 % and ∼81–89 %, respectively.

"Promotion effect of cobalt doping on microwave-initiated plastic deconstruction for hydrogen production over iron catalysts Microwave-initiated deconstruction of plastic into hydrogen and high-value carbons is an attractive upcycling technology. However, the interplay between microwave field and catalyst material and the reaction mechanism were not fully understood. In this study, Co doping Fe-Al catalysts were synthesized for hydrogen production from LDPE using microwave and conventional heating. The Fe1Co1Al2 catalyst yielded hydrogen at 61.39 mmol/gplastic under microwave, which was almost two times higher than conventional heating. Characterization indicated Co doped spinel iron catalyst under microwave rapidly transformed into the highly active FeCo alloy for plastic dehydrogenation. The microwave field was responsible for the rapid formation of FeCo, as it enhanced the charge transfer from H to Fe. The Co doping also inhibited the formation of Fe3C during plastic deconstruction, which changed the carbon diffusion pathway and promoted the formation of nanotubes and hydrogen production.","The study involves microwave-initiated pyrolysis of LDPE plastic, with measurable hydrogen yield, catalyst characterization, and analysis of reaction mechanisms and product formation."
"Co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and polyolefin with solid heat carrier: Synergistic deoxygenation and high-yield hydrocarbon production in rotary kiln The global depletion of fossil fuels necessitates the efficient valorization of biomass and plastic wastes. This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust (PS) with polyolefins (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene, PP) using a solid heat carrier in a rotary kiln to intensify bio-oil production. Thermal degradation behaviours and kinetic analyses revealed significant synergistic interactions: molten polyolefins permeated the biomass matrix, facilitating hydrogen radical transfer that suppressed oxygenated compounds (e.g., phenolics, furans) and enhanced hydrocarbon formation. Optimized pyrolysis with solid heat carrier parameters (570 °C, 8 % filling ratio, 0.45 mm particle size) maximized bio-oil yield (43.1 wt%) from PS. Co-pyrolysis with PE or PP at a 1:2 ratio further increased the bio-oil yield to 53.3 wt%, while reducing oxygenated compounds by over 70 % and significantly enriching aliphatic hydrocarbons (81.2 % with PE; 78.4 % with PP). The effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio governed hydrocarbon selectivity, yielding 30.7-32.4% (C8–C23) alkanes suitable for jet/diesel fuels. The gas calorific value surged to 31.6 MJ/m³ due to the synergistic generation of C₂–C₄ hydrocarbons (45.2 vol%). The process intensification, primarily driven by enhanced heat transfer and hydrogen-donor plasticity of polyolefins, establishes a foundational platform for subsequent studies on in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis using functionalized solid heat carriers. This work validates co-pyrolysis with a solid heat carrier as a technically viable route for producing high-value bio-oil from biomass and plastic wastes.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of polyolefin waste plastics (PE, PP) with pine sawdust in a rotary kiln, reporting measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Characterization and evaluation of resource recovery potential of beach plastic wastes using analytical Py-GC/MS The majority of ocean plastic wastes supposedly comes from land-based sources, while the remaining comes from marine-based activities and sources such as lines, fishing nets, abandoned vessels and ropes. In this study, plastic wastes were collected from the sea shore in Chennai, India, and thoroughly characterized to determine their composition and plastic types. Eight out of nineteen samples were polyethylenes (PE), and their thermal stability, functional group and elemental composition were assessed using different techniques. Analytical pyrolysis hyphenated with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was performed to identify impurities and quantify the volatile hydrocarbons. Thermal desorption indicated the presence of fatty acids and plasticizers such as dimethyl and diethyl phthalates in most of the samples. The PE samples varied significantly in terms of their typical decomposition products, and the overall selectivities to alkenes, alkanes and alkadienes were in the range of 44.79–53.15%, 21.77–29.0% and 17.56–22.56%, respectively. The major products, alkenes, were distributed in the carbon number range of C5-C20. Upto 16 wt% of the hydrocarbons in the pyrolysate from various samples were quantified based on carbon number range.","The study involves lab-scale analytical pyrolysis of beach plastic waste (PE) with measurable product yields, composition analysis, and temperature-dependent decomposition products."
"Influence of the ratio of Fe/Al2O3 on waste polypropylene pyrolysis for high value-added products Thermo conversion technology has been considering as a promising one to realize the high value of waste plastics. However, low selectivity of target products limited the further utilization fundamentally. Herein, alumina supported with different iron ratio catalyst was introduced to improve the properties of products. The results show that the hydrogen in gaseous product increased dramatically with the increase in the iron ratio, and the maximum content was 82 vol% while the ratio of iron and alumina was 2:1. For liquid oil, the yield suffered from an apparent reduction, while the content of naphthalene increased first and then decreased and reached the maximum of over 70 area% when the iron and alumina was 1:2. Simultaneously, carbon deposits yield on catalysts increased with the increase iron ratio, and the maximum one of approximately 42 wt% was obtained from the catalyst with ratio of 1:1. Further research shows that the carbon deposits on the catalyst were composed of abundant carbon nanotubes (CNTs), varying from ~8 to 20 nm of diameters. This study presents a feasible strategy to deal with plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polypropylene with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Impact of the presence of common polymer additives in thermal and catalytic polyethylene decomposition Chemical recycling of waste plastics has attracted growing global interest in recent years. However, the role that polymer additives play during these depolymerization reactions is still unknown. In this work, we investigate the impact of typical additives on the rate of reaction of pyrolysis and catalytic decomposition over zeolites. Further, we regenerate the spent catalysts after contact with additive-containing polymer and assess modifications to the catalyst structure and activity. All the tested additives were found to hinder the activity of ZSM-5 catalysts. We also unveil that some additives (amines, phenols) can be fully removed from the catalyst via calcination, whereas others (phosphites, metallic stearate) may permanently deposit and modify sites. The deposition of such impurities on zeolites may change their alkane cracking capabilities. After regeneration, zinc deposited on the catalyst (resulting from plastic degradation reactions) was able to increase hexane cracking conversion by over 7-fold when compared to fresh ZSM-5.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene with additives, measuring catalyst performance and product composition, with clear yield and catalytic activity data."
"HDPE pyrolysis-steam reforming in a tandem spouted bed-fixed bed reactor for H2 production Steam pyrolysis (500°C) of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a conical spouted bed reactor followed by a steam reforming (700°C) in a fixed bed reactor (Ni commercial catalyst) has been carried out for obtaining a syngas stream rich in H2. The product yields obtained in the pyrolysis of HDPE using steam are very similar to the previous ones with N2 as fluidizing agent. A comparison of the results obtained here with those for gasification-reforming strategy reveals that tar and C2+ hydrocarbons are not fully reformed using the pyrolysis-reforming strategy. Besides, although a high H2 yield is obtained (81.5% the stoichiometric value), it is slightly lower than the yield obtained in gasification-reforming. Coke yield is high (4.43wt.%), which causes fixed bed blockage and hinders a correct flow of the volatiles through the bed. SEM, TEM and TPO results show that two types of coke are deposited on the catalyst, with amorphous coke prevailing in the pyrolysis-reforming strategy and filamentous coke in gasification-reforming.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE in a spouted bed reactor followed by steam reforming, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization including SEM, TEM, and TPO."
"Hydrogen production by catalysed pyrolysis of polymer blends Differently composed mixtures of HDPE and PMMA were pyrolysed at 700°C and 815°C in pyrolysis reactor. It was directly coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). On line pyrolysis GC/MS was applied in analysis of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide yielding in polymer blends pyrolyzate with/without metal (Ni,Co) coated particles, tested as a methane to hydrogen conversion catalysts supporting additives. They were prepared by electrochemical deposition of Ni and Co on the small iron particles surface. Maximum hydrogen production was confirmed at the highest pyrolysis temperature (815°C), and the highest HDPE contents in the blends mixture. Higher content of the PMMA in the mixture led to higher production of CO and lower hydrogen contents in pyrolyzate. Nickel and cobalt containing additives affected production of hydrogen and other components at both 700°C and 815°C pyrolysis temperatures. An effect of different heat distribution between metal particles and polyblends occurred and affected hydrogen production. Application of pyrolysis gas chromatography in hydrogen production from polyblends represents an important tool to model future technological outputs as well simultaneous hydrogen production and CO, CO2 elimination. Moreover, catalysis assisted conversion of methane to hydrogen can improve final hydrogen content in pyrolyzate. Effectivity of pyrolysis hydrogen production was determined by its quantification based on analytical calibration.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic mixtures (HDPE and PMMA) at defined temperatures with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization using GC–MS."
"Catalytic cracking of wax pyrolysis oil derived from municipal plastic waste over aluminosilicate-based catalysts The formation of wax during the pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste has made it challenging to handle and valorize the resulting pyrolysis oil. This study evaluated the catalytic cracking process of wax pyrolysis oil produced from the pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste using three types of aluminosilicate-based catalysts, namely HZSM-5, bentonite, and spent FCC catalyst. The catalytic cracking was performed at 250 °C and 300 °C in a fixed-bed reactor to investigate the effect of catalyst type and temperature on yield, carbon distribution, and the physical-chemical properties of the liquid product. The results showed that the wax pyrolysis oil had a high heavy carbon content (>C20) of 58.56 %. The use of HZSM-5 at 300 °C produced the highest oil yield of 78.8 wt%, while at lower temperature (250 °C) produced highest light fraction (≤C10) of 59.35 % with HHV of 47.90 MJ/kg. Spent FCC catalyst still showed competent potential at 300 °C, although its effectiveness is lower than that of HZSM-5. Oil products from the distillation showed that catalytic cracking using HZSM-5 was able to produce up to 80 wt% of the combined kerosene and diesel fractions at a temperature of 300 °C. The selection of catalyst and operating temperature is crucial for converting wax into high-value fuels, thus improving the effectiveness and sustainability of plastic waste pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste-derived wax oil using fixed-bed reactors, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Production of clean oil with low levels of chlorine and olefins in a continuous two-stage pyrolysis of a mixture of waste low-density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride In this study, a continuous two-stage pyrolyzer consisting of an auger reactor and a fluidized bed reactor was applied to produce an oil with a low level of chlorine from a mixture of low density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride waste. In the experiment, the auger reactor operated at 300–400 °C, thus releasing HCl prior to the main pyrolysis in the fluidized bed reactor. The auger reactor also played a role in elevating vibrational modes of molecules to promote the production of ethene, propene, and 1,3-butadiene. The yields of those monomers totaled 29 wt.%. Pyrolysis oils obtained from the fluidized bed reactor were enriched with aromatics up to 95 wt.%. Together with the two-stage pyrolyzer and a lime hot filter, a pyrolysis oil having only 9.25 ppm chlorine could be obtained. This value is the lowest ever reported. This study showed that a two-stage pyrolyzer together with a lime hot filter could produce a pyrolysis oil with a very low chlorine content. Further, this work implies that the production of valuable monomers from the pyrolysis of polyolefins can be enhanced when a two-stage pyrolyzer is applied.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste LDPE and PVC mixtures using a two-stage reactor system, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions reported."
"Study of the fuel properties of extracted oils obtained from low and linear low density polyethylene pyrolysis The study focusses on using virgin grades of low and linear low density polyethylene for pyrolysis route of fuel production, in order to mimic the most common municipal plastic waste components as a desirable feedstock with the future aim of integration plans to petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. The oil produced was assessed for basic properties of fuels and insights are provided as to fuel range of common fossil fuel types that it can replace. Effect of reactor temperature and oil yield characteristics was studied and the maximum oil yield (27%) was obtained at 600 °C while higher temperatures (700 and 800 °C) increased the diesel fraction in the pyrolysis oil. It is found that the diesel range hydrocarbons were the most abundant with the highest total sum for samples extracted from low density polyethylene pyrolysis oil. The oil produced is highly desirable and applicable as a fuel with a cetane number of 84. The oils in this work has low aromatic content likely retained by the thermal cracking process in the gaseous product fraction. The flash point measured for the oil samples (80 °C) agree with market standards for diesel fuel. The pour point, however, was slightly higher (10 °C) still making it suitable to be used a diesel.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of low and linear low density polyethylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and fuel property analysis including cetane number, flash point, and pour point."
"Pyrolysis of mixed polyolefins in a fluidised-bed reactor and on a pyro-GC/MS to yield aliphatic waxes Polyolefins (PE, PP and PS) were pyrolysed in a fluidised-bed reactor on kilogram scale at 510°C. Pyrolysis products were analysed with GC, GC/MS and other methods. It was shown that valuable products, mostly aliphatic waxes, are received from polyolefins. It was also investigated if mixtures of different polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) interact with each other in fluidised bed pyrolysis yielding different pyrolysis products than received from the pure, individual polyolefins. The same polymer mixtures were also analysed using a pyro-GC/MS-device.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields and analytical characterization using GC/MS and pyro-GC/MS."
"Enhancement of aromatics production from catalytic co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and LDPE via a two-step approach A two-step catalytic co-pyrolysis (TSCCP) of walnut shell (WNS) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was innovatively studied at a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor using HZSM-5 as a catalyst. Various characterization techniques such as FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Van Krevelen diagram were applied to explore structure evolutions of the derived chars aiming at revealing the step-wise co-pyrolysis mechanisms. In comparison with conventional one-step catalytic co-pyrolysis (OSCCP), the TSCCP has much higher oil production, and less gas and solid yields. The yield of aromatics increased by 34.2 %. Oxygenated compounds in oil were dramatically reduced. As a result, more water was generated. These experimental results have demonstrated that the two-step approach can significantly enhance the synergy of WNS with LDPE. Characterizations revealed that the TSCCP stages the interactions of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin with LDPE. The interaction of lignin with LDPE was thoroughly examined. Possible mechanisms were put forward to explain the synergistic effects of WNS with LDPE enhanced by the two-step approach.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed reactor experiments on waste plastic LDPE and biomass, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst performance evaluation."
"Bio-oil production via co-pyrolysis of almond shell as biomass and high density polyethylene Biomass from almond shell (aS) was co-pyrolyzed with high density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer to investigate the synergistic effects on the product yields and compositions. The pyrolysis temperature was selected as 500°C, based on results of TGA-DTG. Co-pyrolysis of HDPE-biomass mixtures were pyrolysed with various proportions such as 1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 2:1 and 0:1. The yield of liquids produced during co-pyrolysis enhanced 23%, as the weight ratio of HDPE in the mixture was doubled. Obtained bio-oils were analyzed with using column chromatography, 1H NMR, GC/MS, and FT-IR. According to analyses results, produced liquids by co-pyrolysis had higher carbon (26% higher) and hydrogen contents (78% higher), lower oxygen content (%86 less) with a higher heating value (38% higher) than those of biomass oil.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of HDPE (a commercial plastic) with biomass, reports measurable product yields, and provides detailed analytical data on bio-oil composition and properties."
"Multi-scale designed Co x Mn3–x O4 spinels: Smart pre-catalysts towards high-efficiency pyrolysis-catalysis recycling of waste plastics In this work, multiscale designed 3-dimensional (3D) rose-like Co x Mn3–x O4 spinel smart pre-catalysts that can self-convert into the targeted active site-rich Co/MnO catalysts were developed for the high-efficiency conversion of waste plastics. At a pre-catalyst to plastic weight ratio of 1:14, the carbon nanotube composites (CNCs) and H2 yield can reach 41 wt% and 36 mmol·g˗1 pla., while the specific CNCs and H2 yield can be as high as 7.48 g˗1 cat. and 634 mmol·g˗1 pla.·g˗1 cat. The latter is more than one order of magnitude higher than reported in the literature. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Co/MnO catalyst exhibits excellent activity in the dissociation of alkanes (e.g., CH4). The resulting CNCs demonstrated excellent discharge capability and extended cycling performance when used as a lithium-ion battery anode. This work revealed an innovative recipe and novel insight for developing advanced catalyst materials as the next generation catalysts for the conversion of waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics using designed Co x Mn3–x O4 spinel pre-catalysts, with measurable product yields (CNCs, H2) and catalyst performance data reported."
"Pyrolysis behavior of non-textile components (buttons) and their kinetic analysis using artificial neural network This research aims to study the pyrolysis behavior of old buttons (main non-textile components) and their kinetic behavior to convert them into energy and their original chemical compounds. The pyrolysis experiments were performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) on buttons have different composition that were defined using FTIR, elemental and proximate analysis. The composition of the valuable chemicals generated from the pyrolysis process were observed TG-FTIR and GC/MS. The kinetic parameters of the decomposition process were also studied using conventional modeling methods and artificial neural network (ANN) as an advanced machine learning tool. The results showed that polyester, nylon and their blends are the most commonly used materials in button manufacturing. The physical analysis showed that the buttons are very rich in volatile matter content (92.08–99.67 wt%) and completely decompose up to 490 °C at 92–100 wt%. Meanwhile, GC/MS showed that the pyrolysis vapors released from polyester buttons were rich in styrene (84.54 %), while caprolactam (40.30 %) was the dominant compound in nylon buttons versus naphthalene, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-phenyl- (67.71 %) was the major compound in the mixture sample. The kinetic analysis showed that the activation energy of the degradation process was in the ranges of 152–202 kJ/mol (polyester), 156–201 kJ/mol (nylon), 402–449 kJ/mol (mixed) and the ANN model was successfully trained and predicted the degradation regions of the buttons. Accordingly, pyrolysis of buttons is highly recommended to valorize buttons and convert them into parent chemical compounds.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic buttons (polyester, nylon, and blends) with measurable product yields, chemical composition analysis via GC/MS, and kinetic parameters derived from experimental data."
"Thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis product characterization of municipal solid waste using sludge fly ash as additive MSW pyrolysis was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 700 °C and sludge fly ash (SFA) was used as an additive. Only organic fractions of MSW were considered. The yield of the products was compared under three conditions: without SFA, with 5% SFA and with 10% SFA. TG-FTIR was also performed on the single, mixed and SFA fractions of MSW to determine the kinetic parameters of the feedstock. The plastic and rubber fractions were the most useful fractions of MSW. Kinetic analysis showed that addition of SFA resulted in the reduction of the apparent activation energy (E). With SFA pyrolysis, the liquid yield decreased from 20.8% to 6.4% and the gas yield increased from 65.5% to 76.4% with 5% SFA and then, decreased to 73.2% with 10% SFA. The major active species in SFA (CaO, SiO2 and Fe2O3) greatly promoted tar cracking effect, resulting in greater gas and lower liquid yield. Addition of 5% SFA, proved to be the most feasible condition, because of higher H2 yield, lowest char yield and better quality liquid product. Thus, concentration of SFA additive proved to be an important factor in products formation of MSW pyrolysis. The possible ecological risk valuation of heavy metals in chars showed the RI values, with 5% and 10% SFA, as 49.02 and 65.10, respectively. This work demonstrated that addition of sludge fly ash played a vital role in the pyrolysis of MSW.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic-rich municipal solid waste using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products and feedstock."
"Influence of process conditions on the formation of 2–4 ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride Municipal solid waste (MSW) contains significant amounts of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The reactivity of PVC may form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the pyrolysis of MSW, which can become a key challenge during the development of pyrolysis technologies. However, there is very limited work in relation to the influence of pyrolysis process conditions in terms of temperature and heating rate on PAHs formation during pyrolysis of PVC. In this work, the formation of 2–4-ring PAHs from the pyrolysis of PVC at temperatures of 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900°C and at fast and slow heating rates was investigated under a N2 atmosphere in a fixed bed reactor. With the increase of temperature from 500 to 900°C, HCl yield decreased from 54.7 to 30.2wt.%, while the yields of gases and PAHs in the tar increased. Slow pyrolysis generated higher HCl yield, and lower gas and tar yield than fast pyrolysis; the PAH yield obtained from the slow pyrolysis was much lower compared to fast pyrolysis. The results suggest that for fast pyrolysis, the dehydrochlorination of the PVC might be incomplete, resulting in the formation of chlorinated aromatic compounds.","The study investigates the pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waste in a fixed-bed reactor under varying temperatures and heating rates, reporting measurable yields of HCl, gases, tar, and PAHs, with detailed product analysis and reactor conditions."
"Thermal behavior, kinetics and gas evolution characteristics for the co-pyrolysis of real-world plastic and tyre wastes Investigations into the co-pyrolysis of four kinds of real-world plastics (high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS)) and tyre were carried out in a TG-FTIR instrument. The thermal decomposition behavior, conversion kinetics and gas releasing properties during co-pyrolysis process were investigated. It was found that co-pyrolysis of plastics and tyre delayed the pyrolysis process with a wider decomposition temperature range, when compared with the pyrolysis of individual plastic. The kinetic analysis results indicated that the co-pyrolysis process could be divided into three stages by a single first-order reaction model with the activation energies of 65–87, 34–92, and 138–208 kJ/mol, respectively. A positive synergistic interaction was found between PS and tyre, while the co-pyrolysis of PP/HDPE/LDPE and tyre was negatively influenced. During co-pyrolysis of tyre with four kinds of plastics, CH4 was the majority product for HDPE, LDPE and PP, whereas for PS, the aromatics and C–H containing compounds were the main products. The results regarding co-pyrolysis of plastics and tyres provide an insight into an environmentally friendly recycling technology for polymeric wastes.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of real-world plastic waste (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS) and tire waste, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of gases and kinetics."
"Direct production of olefins from waste plastic using a pyrolysis and fluid catalytic cracking integrated process: Part 1. study on the production and analysis of waxy oil obtained using a new type of a fluidized bed reactor The ultimate aim of this research is to produce ethylene and propylene directly from waste plastic. To achieve this, we designed a new cracker having a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) and a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. The FBR produces oil in vapor phase, and the FCC unit transforms the vapor into olefins. As a first step toward achieving the research goal, the current study conducts pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene using a new pyrolysis process having a FBR. By understanding characteristics of pyrolysis oils obtained in this study, it becomes possible to determine its suitability as FCC feed and its relationship with olefin productivity. The current investigation focused on the effects of vapor residence time, reaction temperature, and type of fluidizing medium on yield and composition of oil. The results showed that the waxy oil yield depended highly on reaction temperature, reaching a maximum of about 95 wt%. The sum of yields of n-alkenes and n-alkadienes, which are favorable for producing olefins when catalytically cracked in the FCC unit, reached 82 wt%. SIMDIS analysis, which determines the boiling point range distribution of oil, revealed strong effects of reaction temperature and residence time on the carbon numbers of the waxy oil.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis using SIMDIS and other methods."
"TG/FT-IR analysis of HZSM5 and HUSY deactivation during the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene The TG/FT-IR technique has been employed to study the evolution of the gases evolved during the thermal and catalytic decomposition of low density (LDPE) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). This technique allows to obtain the FT-IR spectra of the gases evolved in situ, as they are generated. The evolution of the gases obtained during the progressive deactivation of the catalysts employed (HZSM5 and HUSY) has also been studied. In the thermal processes the relative intensity of bands related to CH2 respect to those related to CH3 is greater, and the presence of aromatics and olefins is nearly negligible, independently on the branching degree of the polymer. Nevertheless, in the catalytic processes, the composition of the gases evolved depends on the zeolite and the polymer structure. The relative intensity of the bands related to the CH3 group increases at the expense of those related to CH2 indicating, as expected, the reduction in the average molecular weight of the gases evolved during the catalytic process. Higher amounts of alkenes and aromatic compounds were detected with HZSM5 than with HUSY. When the coked catalyst is used in successive cycles, the gases obtained become progressively more similar to those generated in the thermal process, and the same happens with the temperature at which decomposition takes place, thus enabling a nice illustration of the catalyst deactivation through the evolution of the FT-IR spectra.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE using HZSM5 and HUSY catalysts, with measurable experimental data on gas composition, catalyst deactivation, and temperature-dependent evolution of products analyzed via in situ FT-IR and TG/FT-IR."
"A porous media catalyst for waste polyethylene pyrolysis in a continuous feeding reactor This study investigated the catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) using a ZSM-5/Al2O3 porous media catalyst in a continuous feeding mode. The findings revealed that the porous media catalyst with 100 mm height and 40 PPI (pore per inch) pore size had the supreme catalytic performance, which could obtain the highest pyrolysis oil yield and the light fraction (<C12) and aromatics in the oil, and improve the catalytic stability of the porous media catalyst. The optimal operating conditions were the pyrolysis temperature of 460 °C, the carrier gas velocity of 65 mL/min, and the plastic feeding rate of 25 g/h, of which the light fraction and aromatics in the oil were up to 95.25 % and 97.33 %. Moreover, the catalytic cycling performance of the porous media catalyst was thoroughly investigated. The catalytic activity declined and the catalyst deactivation rate decreased after multiple regeneration cycles. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of waste PE catalytic cracking using the porous media catalyst in continuous feeding mode, which can provide insightful guidance on the industrialization of plastic waste valorization.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene using a porous media catalyst with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis."
"Alkaline molten salt thermal treatment of mixed waste plastics for oil production: Insight into the effects of molten salt alkalinity and plastic molecular structure Pyrolysis has emerged as the primary strategy for recycling waste plastics into oil. However, the low thermal conductivity of plastics results in inefficient heat transfer and extended residence times, which is unfavorable for oil production. Here, a novel method by using thermally stable alkaline molten salt as an effective medium to enhance heat transfer and thermal reaction was proposed. The oil yield exhibited a direct correlation with molten salt alkalinity. NaOH-Na2CO3 system achieved remarkable gas upgrading: >99 % chlorine immobilization coupled with alkali-mediated hydrogen enrichment (H2 ratio > 80 %), enabled by catalytic carbon-alkali interactions. Plastic molecular structures governed product selectivity during molten salt thermal treatment: polyolefins (PE/PP) predominantly yielded α-olefins through promoting β-scission reactions, while polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene decomposition generated aromatic hydrocarbons (BTX, styrene) via enhancing dehydrochlorination and aromatization. In co-processing of mixed plastics, weak interactions existed between PE and PP during both conventional and molten salt conversions, with product distributions resembling linear combinations of individual pyrolysis results. PVC-PS blends exhibited significant cross-reactivity: HCl evolved from PVC decomposition engaged in secondary reactions with styrene (PS product). Primary radicals on PS chains post-scission drove depolymerization pathways, elevating ethylbenzene/α-methylstyrene formation at the expense of styrene monomers. Molten salt reduced PVC-PS cross-reactivity via chlorine capture and H-radical redistribution, increasing styrene monomer yields by 142 %. These findings facilitate the high-value recycling of mixed waste plastics for oil production.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics using alkaline molten salts, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"The phenomenology of bed defluidization during the pyrolysis of a food-packaging plastic waste The stability, in long-term operation, of fluidized bed reactors utilised to pyrolyse plastics waste can be seriously compromised by particle agglomeration phenomena. These phenomena can cause poor fluidization and eventually lead to defluidization. In order to investigate this phenomenon, a polypropylene waste from a food-packaging industry was utilised in a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The effect of the main operating variables (bed hold-up, size of inert material, fluidizing velocity, feed rate of plastic pellets) was investigated by means of experiments carried out under an inert atmosphere. The time at which defluidization occurred was correlated with some process variables by means of linear relationships. A new modelling approach was also proposed in order to predict the risk of defluidization under different operating conditions.",The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene waste in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable experimental data on defluidization timing and process variables.
"Development of heterogeneous catalyst by ionically bonding macrocyclic Zr–Zr complex to montmorillonite clay for depolymerization of polypropylene The homonuclear macrocyclic Zr–Zr complex was synthesized by reacting 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with 1,2-phenylenediamine and zirconium oxychloride. The heterogeneous complex catalyst was prepared by ionically bonding it on zirconium pillared montmorillonite. The heterogeneous complex catalyst was shown to be stable at the depolymerizing temperature of polypropylene and the reaction product was a waxy solid alone without forming liquid and gaseous material. The FTIR analysis of this solid was shown to have exactly the same IR of the polypropylene indicating that the depolymerization occurs predominately by first formation of polymer radicals by random scission of the polypropylene chain. The chain radical, thus generated, combines with the catalyst to give a radical cation complex and the movement of this along its chain by bond shift reaction produces low molecular waxy product. Experiments have shown that the molecular weight of this waxy product depends upon the reaction temperature as well as the residence time and all its physical properties (melting point and solubility) can be matched with those of the paraffin wax.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene using a heterogeneous catalyst, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent molecular weight analysis, and FTIR characterization of the waxy product."
"Co-pyrolysis of pine cone with synthetic polymers Biomass from pine cone (Pinus pinea L.) was co-pyrolyzed with synthetic polymers (PE, PP and PS) in order to investigate the effect of biomass and plastic nature on the product yields and quality of pyrolysis oils and chars. The pyrolysis temperature was of 500°C and it was selected based on results from thermogravimetric analysis of the studied samples. Co-pyrolysis products namely gases, aqueous and tar fraction coming from biomass, oils from synthetic polymers and residual char were collected and analyzed. Due to the synergistic effect in the pyrolysis of the biomass/polymer mixtures, higher amounts of liquid products were obtained compared to theoretical ones. To investigate the effect of biomass content on the co-pyrolysis, the co-pyrolysis of pure cellulose as model natural polymer for biomass with polymer mixture was also carried out. In the presence of cellulose, degradation reaction leading to more gas formation and less char yield was more advanced than in the case of co-pyrolysis with pine cone. Co-pyrolysis gave polar oxygenated compounds distributed between tar and aqueous phase and hydrocarbon oils with composition depending on the type of synthetic polyolefin. Co-pyrolysis chars had higher calorific values compared to pyrolysis of biomass alone.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS) with biomass at 500°C, reports measurable product yields and composition analysis, and includes experimental characterization of oils, gases, and char."
"Single pot catalyst strategy to branched products via adhesive isomerization and hydrocracking of polyethylene over platinum tungstated zirconia Hydrocracking is an insufficiently explored route for chemical recycling of plastics waste. Platinum tungstated zirconia (Pt-WZr) was used in a batch reactor at low temperatures of 250 °C and 30 bar H2 pressure for 1−24 h reaction times using low-density polyethylene (LDPE, Mw∼76 kDa). We find Pt-WZr is a bifunctional catalyst for LDPE hydrocracking leading to higher value branched fuel- and lubricant-ranged alkanes. We demonstrate that the catalyst metal-to-acid site molar ratio (MAB) shifts the product distribution to larger cracked products and increases the isomerization degree in the residual polymer. We propose a new adhesive isomerization mechanism between the metal and Brønsted acid sites in parallel with slow polymer chain cracking, caused by competitive adsorption of the polymer over the liquid products and stereochemical hindrance of methines. This study provides a blueprint on how to engineer effective catalysts for hydrocracking polyolefin plastic wastes using the MAB as a catalyst descriptor.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) using a batch reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed characterization of products and mechanisms."
"N-doped carbon carriers loaded with NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu): Catalytic synergistic pyrolysis of herbal residues and polypropylene to generate three-phase products and carbon nanotubes Catalytic pyrolysis can transform organic solid waste into high-quality pyrolysis products, in which N-doped biochar is an efficient and economical catalyst. Herein, N-doped activated carbon (NAC) and modified biochar (NZC) loaded with bimetal NiX (X = Fe, Co, Cu) were used to catalyze the pyrolysis of Chinese medicinal drug residue and polypropylene in a two-stage reaction system to prepare three-phase products and carbon nanotubes. This indicates that the metal/NAC group catalysts possess a larger SBET, whereas the metal/NZC group has better thermal stability. Under NiCo/NZC catalysis, the abundant yield of short-chain carbon C6-C11(49 %) and aromatic hydrocarbons (39.5 %) suggests strong arylation and secondary cracking capabilities. N-doping improved the surface functional group richness of the catalyst, while the bimetal provided more active electrons, which promoted the generation of carbon nanotubes in the late stage of the pyrolysis process. N-doped carbon-based catalysts loaded with metals exhibit an improved catalytic effect, which is conducive to the promotion and application of N-doped catalysts.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (a waste plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and eucalyptus waste wood for fuel pellets production: A study of fuel, mechanical, and combustion characteristics under varying binder proportion The study explores the effect of varying molasses proportions as a binder on the characteristics of densified char obtained through the slow co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and Eucalyptus wood waste (Waste low-density polyethylene – Eucalyptus wood (WLDPE–EW) and Waste Polystyrene – Eucalyptus wood (WPS–EW)). Pyrolysis was conducted at 500 °C with a residence time of 120 min, employing plastic to wood waste ratios of 1:2 and 1:3 (w/w). The focus was on how varying the proportion of molasses (10–30 %), influences the physical and combustion properties of the resulting biofuel pellets. Our findings reveal that the calorific value of the pellets decreased from 28.94 to 27.44 MJ/Kg as the molasses content increased. However, this decrease in calorific value was compensated by an increase in pellet mass density, which led to a higher energy density overall. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of solid bridges between particles, facilitated by molasses, effectively decreasing particle spacing. The structural integrity of the pellets, as measured by the impact resistance index, improved significantly (43–47 %) with the addition of molasses. However, a significant change in the combustion characteristics depicted by lower ignition and burnout temperatures were observed due to decrease in fixed carbon value and increase in volatile matter content, as the proportion of molasses increased. Despite these changes, the pellets demonstrated a stable combustion profile, suggesting that molasses are an effective binder for producing biofuel pellets through the densification of char derived from the co-pyrolysis of plastic and Eucalyptus wood waste. The optimized molasses concentration analyzed through multifactor regression analysis was 16.96 % with 28 % WLDPE proportion to produce WLDPE–EW char pellets. This study highlights the potential of using molasses as a sustainable binder to enhance the mechanical and combustion properties of biofuel pellets, offering a viable pathway for the valorization of waste materials.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, PS) with eucalyptus wood, measuring product yields, fuel properties, and combustion characteristics under defined conditions."
"Synergistic enhancement of bio-oil production, quality, and optimization from co-pyrolysis purun tikus (Eleocharis dulcis) and plastic waste using response surface methodology This study investigated the influence of varying pyrolysis temperatures (400–600°C) and biomass-to-plastic waste ratios (100:0, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, and 40:60) on the product distribution during the co-pyrolysis of Purun tikus (PT) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). The investigation revealed positive synergistic interactions. Notably, the bio-oil yield experienced a significant enhancement under optimal operational conditions (feedstock ratio of 40PT:60PET and a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C), with the yield doubling that of the feedstock ratio of 100PT. The composition of bio-oil compounds was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing that the most abundant compounds were esters (ranging from 30.1 % to 37.2 % area), phenolics (ranging from 11.3 % to 32.2 % area), and furfural (ranging from 4.5 % to 18.5 % area). The study further explored the impact of different experimental conditions on the yields of bio-oil, bio-char, and syngas through the application of response surface methodology. It was determined that the optimal yield of bio-oil was attainable by adjusting the reaction temperature and the ratio of PT to PET. The identified optimum conditions, which resulted in the maximum bio-oil output of 40.46 %, were a PT to PET ratio of 40:60 and a temperature of 600°C.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of plastic waste (PET) and biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of bio-oil composition using GC-MS."
"Pyrolysis of the rejects of a waste packaging separation and classification plant Plastic wastes coming from a waste packaging separation and classification plant have been pyrolysed in a semibatch nonstirred autoclave, swept by a continuous flow of N2. The plastic waste contains 39.5% PE, 34.2% PP, 16.2% PS and EPS, and some other minor materials. Temperatures in the range 400–600°C have been explored, and it has been found that over 460°C total thermal decomposition of the waste plastics takes place. Three catalysts have been tested: HZSM-5, red mud and AlCl3. Solid yields about 5–7%, liquid yields in the range 40–70% and gas yields in the range 12–24% were obtained. The liquid products were a mixture of C5–C20 compounds with a very high proportion of aromatics (>70%). Such liquids contain significant amounts of valuable chemicals such as styrene (20–40%), toluene (9–15%) and ethylbenzene (7–16%) and have rather high GCV (40–43MJkg−1). Thermal pyrolysis oils were a wax-like product which solidified at room temperature, whereas the oils obtained with any of the catalysts were less viscous and maintained in liquid state at room temperature. HZSM-5 favoured gas production and, increased the aromaticity and decreased the carbon number of the oils. AlCl3 did not modify pyrolysis yields but gave rise to lighter liquids. Red mud produced higher liquid yields and the liquids were less viscous, but it was not observed a clear effect on the carbon number of the oils.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, EPS) with measurable yields, catalyst performance, product composition, and reactor conditions."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene to produce sustainable aviation fuel fractions: Improving isomerized alkane selectivity via magnetic metal-modified HY zeolites To produce isomerized sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fractions through plastic wastes' atmospheric pyrolysis is rarely reported. This study addresses the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over magnetic metal-modified HY zeolite catalysts for producing isomerized alkane-type SAF fractions without requiring external hydrogen in an atmospheric fixed-bed reactor. The findings reveal that a lower Si/Al ratio enhances the formation of acid sites on the HY zeolite, which results in increased olefin conversion and produces oil with alkanes' selectivity achieving 60 area%, especially HY12 shows the best performance. The introduction of three magnetic metal oxides (Fe, Co, and Ni) into HY12 changes the acid site distribution with the strong to weak acid site ratio ranging from 0.18 to 0.31. It elevates isomerized alkanes’ selectivity in the aviation fuel range to more than 50 area%. The 6 wt% Fe2O3/HY12 catalyst corresponds to an iso-alkane selectivity of 51.57 area%, a total SAF fraction selectivity of 84.27 area% and an oil yield of 74.33 wt%. Furthermore, this catalyst operates without pre-reduction as the metal oxides can be reduced in situ during pyrolysis, and it also allows for the magnetic recovery of the spent catalyst. Finally, the mechanism for the formation of iso-alkanes and coke deposition onto the catalyst has been proposed. This research provides essential insights for optimizing plastic waste pyrolysis for preparing SAF and tailoring its composition.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Recovery of phenol and acetic acid from glass fibre reinforced thermoplastic resin using catalytic pyrolysis process on ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst and its kinetic behaviour Glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastic (GFRP) is the composite material of choice for engineers to improve their design, save expenses, and achieve sustainability goals, what leads to generation of a big quantity of GFRP waste (during production or as an end-life-product) that needs to be disposed of safely. In order to valorise GFRP waste, this research aims to recover phenol and acetic acid as high-added value chemical and energy products from the millions of tons of GFRP waste produced annually during the catalytic pyrolysis process. The experiments were performed on glass fibre-reinforced poly(methyl methacrylate)-PMMA (GF/PM) as a common and commercial thermoplastic resin in five stages. In the first stage, the thermal decomposition of the milled feedstock over different percentages of ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst to feedstock in the ranges 0.5–5 wt.% (w/w) was performed using TGA. The generated volatile products from TGA were analysed using TG-FTIR and GC/MS in the second and third stages, respectively. The fourth stage was used to study the kinetic behaviour of catalytic pyrolysis of the feedstock with different catalysts and at different heating conditions using isoconversional models. In the last stage, the experimental thermal decomposition curves were simulated numerically. The results showed that ZSM/GF/PM can decompose significantly in the ranges 320–460 °C. Meanwhile, 2 wt.% of catalyst-to-GF/PM ratio was sufficient to recover more than 48% of phenol, 23% of acetic acid, 19% carbon dioxide compounds at 30 °C/min with high intensity of aromatic benzene. Also, this batch gave a higher kinetic complexity in terms of activation energy in the ranges 100–200 kJ/mol (linear models) and 230–440 kJ/mol (nonlinear models). These results confirm that involvement of 2 wt.% ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in the pyrolysis of GF/PM has a big impact on the formulated volatile components and their potential upscaling.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastic resin (GF/PM), a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization using GC/MS and TGA-FTIR."
"The effect of silica–alumina catalysts on degradation of polyolefins by a continuous flow reactor Catalytic degradation of polyolefins was performed in a continuous flow reactor that allows the study of the degradation processes at steady state, characterized by constant values of reaction parameters and properties of the products. The continuous flow reactor was operated at atmospheric pressure and at feed rate of 0–1.5kgh−1 polyolefins over two silica–alumina catalysts having different SiO2/Al2O3 mole ratio. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) were degraded at 420, 380 and 360°C respectively. The cracking effect of silica–alumina was proved by the increased amount of gaseous products and by the decreased molecular weight of liquid products. The differences in surface area and in concentration and acidic strength of active centers of the two catalysts affected the distribution of degradation products. Molar rate of degradation was increased in the presence of catalysts, however the mass rate of degradation was decreased leading to higher values of the calculated activation energies. These interesting results might open new perspectives in understanding the macroscopic mechanism for catalytic degradation of polyolefins.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) in a continuous flow reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene to co-produce BTX aromatics and H2 by Ni/ZSM-5 in the rotary reactor with solid heat carriers Plastic waste pollution has become a crucial concern in the field of environmental conservation. Catalytic pyrolysis offers an appealing and efficient technology that can convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or valuable chemical products. This provides a practical solution to address the challenges associated with waste management. In this research, an innovative approach of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis was employed in a rotary reactor with solid heat carriers, along with a Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, to simultaneously produce BTX aromatics and hydrogen from polyethylene. Experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. This was achieved by adjusting the metallic nickel loadings on the ZSM-5 support. Next, the effect of Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts and the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio on the selectivity of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil and hydrogen was examined. The results revealed that as the metallic nickel loading increased to 10 wt%, the concentration of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil also increased and reached a maximum of 59.2%. Furthermore, the hydrogen gas fraction in the pyrolysis gas was 58.0 vol% when using the 10Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process. The Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated a significant positive effect in cleaving the H∙ group. By varying the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio from 0.5 to 2, the concentration of monocyclic aromatics in the pyrolysis oil increased from 68.2% to 87.7%. However, the catalyst-to-feed ratio had an insignificant impact on the hydrogen fraction in the pyrolysis gas, with the hydrogen gas fraction ranging from 43.9 vol% to 46.8 vol%. Additionally, this study provided insights into the potential mechanism of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene within the rotary kiln.","The study involves lab-scale in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene waste using a Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in a rotary reactor, with measurable yields of BTX aromatics (59.2%) and hydrogen (58.0 vol%), along with catalyst-to-feed ratio effects and product composition analysis."
"Evaluation of zeolite catalysts on product distribution and synergy during wood-plastic composite catalytic pyrolysis The catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood-polypropylene composite (WPP) over different zeolite catalysts (HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and HUSY) was investigated to obtain the influence of zeolite properties on both product distribution and synergistic effect using Py-GC/MS. The yield of aromatics was in the order: HZSM-5 > HY > HBeta > HUSY. HZSM-5 facilitated the formation of monomethyl aromatics, whereas HBeta and HY tended to promote the formation of polymethyl aromatics due to the larger pore size. The coke yield of HZSM-5 (6.4%) was much lower than those of other zeolites tested (11.4–20.2%), suggesting that the pore size of a zeolite was mainly responsible for coke formation during WPP pyrolysis. The strong synergistic effects between poplar and polypropylene in WPP pyrolysis were observed with all the zeolite catalysts tested as the experimental and calculated product distribution was significantly different. The synergistic effect over HZSM-5 zeolite promoted the selectivity for polyaromatics instead of mono aromatics, whereas the mono aromatics yield was increased by 28% for HBeta and 15% for HY zeolite. Our findings suggest that the catalytic pyrolysis of wood-plastic composites over the zeolite catalyst with suitable pore size and acidity might provide a viable and efficient route to generate hydrocarbons.","The study investigates catalytic pyrolysis of a waste plastic (polypropylene) in a wood-plastic composite using lab-scale experiments with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes via catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts: Effect of Fe loading on the catalytic activity Thermochemical conversion is a promising waste plastic recycling technology from both an economic and environmental point of view, as it can convert plastics into high-value chemicals. In this work, the co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Fe loading (5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%) was investigated using a two-stage fixed bed reactor. The results show that the yield of CNTs and hydrogen increases first and then decreases with the increase of Fe loading. The 20Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest CNTs yield of 262.24 mg/gPE and the maximum hydrogen production of 31.72 mmol/gPE. The fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, SEM, TEM, etc., in order to explore the correlation between the catalytic activity and the Fe active metal load of the catalysts. The results showed that, within a certain range, the number of active sites increased with the increase of Fe loading, which promoted the conversion of hydrogen and CNTs. However, when the Fe loading reached 30%, the active particles agglomerated and inhibited the growth of CNTs. 30Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst produced many carbon nanoonions (CNOs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Overall, in terms of the yield of the produced hydrogen and CNTs, the 20Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the best catalytic performance.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene (a waste plastic) in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields of hydrogen and CNTs, catalyst characterization, and temperature-dependent performance data."
"The role of catalyst acidity and microstructure on light olefin selectivity in polyethylene deconstruction in short contact time pulse Joule-heated reactors The growing volume of plastics waste, compounded with a low recycling rate, has led to an alarming amount of plastics ending up in landfills or being incinerated. While pyrolysis offers a route for plastic waste deconstruction, its product distribution is often broad and poorly controlled due to unselective radical chemistry at high temperatures. We recently demonstrated that rapid pulse Joule-heated catalytic cracking over HZSM-5, combined with small fractions of steam, can achieve high selectivity (>80 %) toward C2-C4 olefins, while significantly reducing coking compared to continuous Joule heating. Here, we investigate how acid catalyst properties, such as silica/alumina ratio, zeolite topology, and catalyst porosity, influence light olefin selectivity during polyethylene deconstruction via rapid pulse Joule heating. We demonstrate that silica-to-alumina ratios of ∼30 yield high light olefin selectivity, and small-pore zeolites favor light olefins at the expense of increased coke formation. To mitigate coking, we synthesize HZSM-5 nanosheets and hierarchical zeolites (MFI, FAU, and CHA). These catalysts achieve an ethylene selectivity of approximately 35 %, a twofold increase over prior catalytic pyrolysis. Additionally, co-feeding steam and incorporating hierarchical porosity reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polyethylene using pulse Joule-heated reactors with catalysts, reporting measurable yields, selectivity, and catalyst performance data."
"Recycling of Tetra pak wastes via pyrolysis: Characterization of solid products and application of the resulting char in the adsorption of mercury from water This paper provides a detailed analysis of the recycling of Tetra Pak waste via pyrolysis to recover the most valuable solid products within its composition, char and aluminum, and the subsequent application of the char in the adsorption of mercury in aqueous solutions. The impact of the Tetra Pak pyrolysis conditions on the char and aluminum yields and their associated properties have been analyzed using a variety of physico-chemical techniques. Tetra Pak-derived chars showed outstanding mercury adsorption properties (up to 215.7 mg/g) that can be attributed to the heterogeneous surface chemistry composed mainly by oxygenated functional groups associated to C, Ca, Al and Si. Tetra Pak pyrolysis allowed an effective recovery of aluminum at pyrolysis temperatures of 600 and 800 °C. Higher temperatures, up to 1000 °C, promote its oxidation to aluminum oxide and hydroxide. These findings contribute to increase the versatility in the Tetra Pak reuse to develop new adsorbents with promising performance for water treatment and the associated recovery of aluminum for further industrial applications.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of Tetra Pak waste (a mixed plastic waste stream) with measured char and aluminum yields, characterized using physico-chemical techniques, and reports extractable data on mercury adsorption performance and temperature-dependent recovery."
"Co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics on Ni-Fe bimetallic catalyst To explore the mechanism of the influence of Ni-Fe bimetallic catalyst for the producing high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with clean hydrogen from waste plastic pyrolysis, the pyrolysis-catalysis of plastics were performed using a two stage fixed bed reaction system with Ni and Fe loading at variant molar ratios. The catalysts and produced carbon were analysed with various characterization method, including temperature-programed reduction/oxidation, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy or/and Raman spectroscopy. Both the H2 concentration and H2 yield reached maximum values of 73.93vol.% and 84.72mgg−1 plastic, respectively, as the ratio of Ni:Fe at 1:3. The amount and quality of CNTs were greatly influenced by the catalyst composition, and Ni and Fe display different roles to the overall reactivity of Ni-Fe catalyst for the pyrolysis-catalysis of waste plastics. Catalyst with more Fe loading produced more hydrogen and deposited carbon, due to higher cracking ability and the relatively lower interaction between active sites and support. The presence of Ni in Ni-Fe bimetallic catalyst enhanced the thermal stability and graphitization degree of produced carbons. The thermal quality of filamentous carbons might be associated with carbon defects.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes, catalyst characterization, and product analysis."
"Design and thermal characterization of an induction-heated reactor for pyrolysis of solid waste A small-scale induction heated reactor (IHR) was specifically developed to study fast pyrolysis, here investigated as the first step of gasification process, representing some of the reaction conditions encountered in a fluidized bed reactor. First, the thermal response of the system was characterized at transient and steady state, and CFD calculations were performed to have a complete description of the temperature profiles inside the reactor. The novel device can handle a few grams of solid at temperatures up to 900 °C, allowing high heating rates (near 80 °C/s) and a uniform distribution of temperature in the sample. Secondly, the pyrolysis of a solid recovered fuel (SRF) sample was carried out at 800 °C, and the distribution and composition of reaction products were analyzed and compared with tests performed in a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor (FBR). The results obtained in the IHR showed a good reproducibility. The same main gas and tar species were measured in the IHR and FBR, with some differences in gas and tar composition that were attributed to the extent of secondary reactions, enhanced by higher heat transfer rates and the presence of bed material in the FBR.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of solid recovered fuel (SRF), a type of waste plastic, using an induction-heated reactor with measurable product yields and composition analysis."
"Thermal recycling of polystyrene and polystyrene-butadiene dissolved in a light cycle oil A study has been made of the cracking on a mesoporous silica of polystyrene (PS) and polystyrene-butadiene (PS-BD) dissolved in a light cycle oil (LCO) from a product stream of a commercial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. This study has been carried out in a reactor of short contact time (3 s) in the 723–823 K range. This strategy for simultaneous valorization of plastics and solvent avoids the technological problems inherent to the treatment of solid postconsumer-plastics and the limitation to heat transfer in the process of pyrolysis. The cracking of plastics has a synergistic effect on the conversion of LCO, as it contributes to increasing the yield of gasoline (C5–C12). The cracking of the PS/LCO blend produces high yields of styrene, whereas the cracking of the PS-BD/LCO blend produces a stream of products with petrochemical interest.","The study involves pyrolysis of polystyrene and polystyrene-butadiene in a light cycle oil using a short-contact-time reactor, with measurable product yields and temperature-dependent conversion, indicating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
"Thermal conversion of non-recyclable discarded fishing nets from the Gulf of Thailand for marketable resource recovery Discarded fishing gear, especially abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing nets (ALDFG), has become a major global problem due to its negative impact on the environment and economy. While efforts are underway to remove ALDFG from the ocean floor, many of these nets get contaminated with marine organisms and sediments, which complicates recycling. Consequently, they often end up in landfills. This study investigates the potential of thermal conversion of discarded fishing nets (DFNs) collected from the Gulf of Thailand for resource recovery. We analyzed the materials and thermal properties of four types of fishing nets such as K-island fishing net (KFN), L-island fishing net (LFN), M-island fishing net (MFN), and U-island fishing net (UFN) using FTIR and TGA. Additionally, pyrolysis experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 400 to 700°C using Py-GCMS. The results showed that polyamide nets (KFN, LFN, MFN) produced substantial yields of caprolactam, exceeding 74 % at 400°C and significantly reduced to 26–60 % at 700°C by thermal cleavage. Furthermore, difference selectivity of N-amide in pyrolyzed products of each fishing net related to netting patterns and presence of contaminants. In contrast, the polyethylene net (UFN) primarily generated alkanes and alkenes, highlighting distinct degradation pathways. Fast pyrolysis of polyamide nets yielded N-amides, particularly caprolactam, a valuable precursor for nylon production with significant market potential. Comparison with conventional caprolactam synthesized from cyclohexanone (66–98 % yield), pyrolysis fishing net could produce 64–86 % of alternative caprolactam. This approach provides an alternative to landfill disposal by converting non-recyclable fishing nets into useful feedstocks, thereby enhancing waste management strategies. Furthermore, the study aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11, 12, 13, and 14 by promoting resource recovery and addressing marine pollution. Future research should assess the carbon footprint of pyrolysis-derived caprolactam compared to traditional production methods, evaluating its role in sustainable manufacturing and low-carbon material recovery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic fishing nets (polyamide and polyethylene) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed product characterization using Py-GCMS and FTIR."
"Hydrogen production from biomass and plastic mixtures by pyrolysis-gasification The addition of plastics to the steam pyrolysis/gasification of wood sawdust with and without a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated in order to increase the production of hydrogen in the gaseous stream. To study the influence of the biomass/plastic ratio in the initial feedstock, 5, 10 and 20 wt.% of polypropylene was introduced with the wood in the pyrolysis reactor. To investigate the effect of plastic type, a blend of 80 wt.% of biomass and 20 wt.% of either polypropylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene or a mixture of real world plastics was fed into the reactor. The results showed that a higher gas yield (56.9 wt.%) and a higher hydrogen concentration and production (36.1 vol.% and 10.98 mmol H2 g−1 sample, respectively) were obtained in the gaseous fraction when 20 wt.% of polypropylene was mixed with the biomass. This significant improvement in gas and hydrogen yield was attributed to synergetic effects between intermediate species generated via co-pyrolysis. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst dramatically improved the gas yield as well as the hydrogen concentration and production due to the enhancement of water gas shift and steam reforming reactions. Very low amounts of coke (less than 1 wt.% in all cases) were formed on the catalyst during reaction, with the deposited carbonaceous material being of the filamentous type. The Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was shown to be effective for hydrogen production in the co-pyrolysis/gasification process of wood sawdust and plastics.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis-gasification of waste plastics (PP, HDPE, PS) mixed with biomass, with measurable product yields, hydrogen production, and catalyst performance data."
"Assessing the feasibility of chemical recycling via steam cracking of untreated plastic waste pyrolysis oils: Feedstock impurities, product yields and coke formation Chemical recycling of plastic waste to base chemicals via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking of pyrolysis oils shows great potential to overcome the limitations in present means of plastic waste recycling. In this scenario, the largest concern is the feasibility. Are plastic waste pyrolysis products acceptable steam cracking feedstocks in terms of composition, product yields and coke formation? In this work, steam cracking of two post-consumer plastic waste pyrolysis oils blended with fossil naphtha was performed in a continuous bench-scale unit without prior treatment. Product yields and radiant coil coke formation were benchmarked to fossil naphtha as an industrial feedstock. Additionally, the plastic waste pyrolysis oils were thoroughly characterized. Analyses included two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector for the detailed hydrocarbon composition as well as specific analyses for heteroatoms, halogens and metals. It was found that both pyrolysis oils are rich in olefins (∼48 wt%) and that the main impurities are nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, bromine, aluminum, calcium and sodium. Steam cracking of the plastic waste derived feedstocks led to ethylene yields of ∼23 wt% at a coil outlet temperature of 820 °C and ∼28 wt% at 850 °C, exceeding the ethylene yield of pure naphtha at both conditions (∼22 wt% and ∼27 wt%, respectively). High amounts of heavy products were formed when steam cracking both pyrolysis oils, respectively. Furthermore, a substantial coking tendency was observed for the more contaminated pyrolysis oil, indicating that next to unsaturated hydrocarbons, contaminants are a strong driver for coke formation.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of post-consumer plastic waste, followed by steam cracking of the resulting oils, with measurable product yields, coke formation, and detailed chemical characterization."
"Improving the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene and polypropylene with acidic clay catalysts using pre-degradation method Catalytic pyrolysis of plastics with clay catalysts was studied using pyrolysis reactor experiments and GC analysis of the formed liquid. In quest for improving the quantity and quality of the product yields, during catalytic pyrolysis of plastic pellets rather than fine powder, pre-degradation was used as a pre-treatment method. A detailed study of the effect of various experimental conditions of the method was carried out and applied to the catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins with clay catalysts. As revealed by the experiments, pre-degradation as a pre-treatment method increased the liquid yield while decreased the coke yield compared to conventional mixing with optimal operating conditions of 150 °C temperature and 10 min holding time. Increasing the temperature or reaction time beyond this limit continued to decrease coke yield and improved coke volatility but decreased liquid yield. No coke from normal mixing volatilised below 500 °C, in contrast to pre-degradation pyrolysis coke, in particular at holding times of 10 min and above. Furthermore, specific effects of clay based catalyst type and polymer type were investigated on liquid product yield as well as product distribution.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene and polypropylene waste plastics with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and catalyst performance analysis."
"Chemical characterization of mixed plastic pyrolysis oils relevant for cracker reintegration by advanced two-dimensional gas chromatography Pyrolysis oils are the crucial link between waste and chemicals in plastic recycling via pyrolysis. Oils from mixed plastic waste pyrolysis are complex mixtures of organic compounds typically containing impurities of nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine. Therefore, their characterization is challenging. This study presents a tailored two-dimensional gas chromatography method supporting in-depth analysis of the chemical composition. It covers a boiling range from the naphtha cut to the middle distillate. These fractions represent the preferred feedstocks to be substituted by plastic pyrolysis oils in the future. The oil characterization is complemented by elemental analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and simulated distillation. The enhanced separation by two-dimensional chromatography results in significantly higher resolution than conventional one-dimensional methods. The most relevant oil compounds can be clustered, distinguished, and quantified based on compound grouping. Depending on the boiling range of the pyrolysis oils, 77 wt% to 96 wt% of the sample composition can be elucidated. Detecting main heteroatom-containing species such as benzoic acid, ε-caprolactam, acetophenone, and various aromatic nitriles provides detailed information for further pyrolysis oil utilization. The combination of the developed method with common analyses offers an advanced approach to evaluate the reintegration of contaminated mixed plastics oils into existing petrochemical value chains.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste, with measurable product characterization including chemical composition analysis via advanced two-dimensional gas chromatography and other analytical methods."
"Effect of ZnCl2-activated biochar on catalytic pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics for producing aromatic-enriched oil ZnCl2-activated biochar produced by one-step (impregnated by a 40% ZnCl2 solution, defined as Zn/C-I) and two-step (impregnated by a 40% ZnCl2 solution and microemulsion, defined as Zn/C-II and Zn/C-III, respectively) methods was used to catalyze the pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (polyethylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene) to comparatively study their catalytic effect on aromatic-enriched oil production. The catalytic mechanism was discussed. The results show that ZnCl2-activated biochar showed high catalytic selectivity to aromatics during the pyrolysis of plastics at 500 °C, and the content of aromatics was increased to 47.5, 46.8, and 42.4% when respectively catalyzed by Zn/C-I, Zn/C-II, and Zn/C-III. Two-ring aromatics were significantly enriched, which accounted for 90.7, 73.1, and 87.7% of the aromatics in Zn/C-I, Zn/C-II, and Zn/C-III catalytic pyrolysis oils. 1,3-Diphenylpropane was the major component of the oils, and its proportion was 19.4, 11.5, and 15.9% in Zn/C-I, Zn/C-II, and Zn/C-III catalytic pyrolysis oils, respectively. The introduced Zn species could increase the surface acidity by forming Lewis acid sites (Zn-L), which increased aromatic yields by promoting the Diels–Alder reaction, hydrogen transfer, and dehydrogenation processes. Zn-L also promoted the condensation reaction of aromatics. Compared with Zn/C-I, Zn/C-III treated by ZnCl2 microemulsion could reduce 41.8% of coke on the catalysts owing to its larger pore size, while maintaining a relatively high oil quality.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PE and PS) using ZnCl2-activated biochar, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst performance data reported."
"Comparision of real waste (MSW and MPW) pyrolysis in batch reactor over different catalysts. Part I: Product yields, gas and pyrolysis oil properties Pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and municipal plastic waste (MPW) have been investigated in batch reactor at 500, 550 and 600°C both in absence and presence of catalysts (Y-zeolite, β-zeolite, equilibrium FCC, MoO3, Ni–Mo-catalyst, HZSM-5 and Al(OH)3). The effect of the parameters on the product properties was investigated. Products were characterized using gas-chromatography, GC/MS, 13C NMR. Yields of volatile fractions increased, while reaction time necessity for the total cracking decreased in the presence of catalysts. Catalysts have productivity and selectivity in converting aliphatic hydrocarbons to aromatic and cyclic compounds in oil products. Gases from MSW consisted of hydrogen CO, CO2, while exclusively hydrogen and hydrocarbons were detected from MPW. Catalyst efficiency was higher using MPW than MSW. Pyrolysis oils contained aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, cyclic compounds and less ketones, alcohols, acids or esters depending on the raw materials.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (MSW and MPW) in a batch reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product characterization using GC–MS and other analytical methods."
"Catalytic conversion of plastic waste into diesel fuel through pyrolysis and hydroprocessing This study evaluates the potential of hydro-processed plastic pyrolysis oil (HPO) as a sustainable alternative fuel derived from mixed plastic waste. The physicochemical properties of diesel, mixed plastic pyrolysis oil (MPPO), and HPO were thoroughly analyzed according to IS standards, enabling a direct comparison and alignment of HPO characteristics with EN590 diesel fuel standards. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified key fuel components—n-alkanes, alkenes, benzene, and naphthalene with HPO showing 98 % compositional similarity to commercial diesel. The HPO blend with various percentage of pure diesel ratio is (30:70, 60:40 and 90:10). The hydroprocessing technique effectively reduced the alkene content of MPPO, enhancing the purity and quality of the resulting HPO. This refinement was crucial in ensuring that the oil met the necessary fuel standards. Engine performance evaluations further indicated that blending HPO with conventional diesel resulted in emissions with 95 % similarity to those of standard diesel fuel. This close match in emission profiles underscores the potential of HPO as a cleaner and more environmentally friendly fuel alternative. Additionally, the increased aromatic content in HPO, due to hydroprocessing, significantly improved combustion properties. This enhancement not only supports the feasibility of using HPO as a substitute for traditional diesel but also suggests that HPO may offer superior performance in specific applications. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of HPO as a sustainable fuel option, capable of addressing the environmental impacts associated with both plastic waste and fossil fuel consumption. The study demonstrates the environmental benefits of converting plastic waste into valuable fuel through pyrolysis and hydroprocessing, offering a promising strategy for sustainable plastic waste management and advancements in environmental sustainability and the fuel industry.","The study involves pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste to produce pyrolysis oil, followed by hydroprocessing, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis via GC-MS, and engine performance data."
"Identification and characterization of plastics from small appliances and kinetic analysis of their thermally activated pyrolysis The first step consisted in a field investigation carried out in Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) treatment plants coupled with a bibliographic product analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy polymers identification. Three main polymers of the thermoplastic fraction of small appliances were identified: in the external cases it was possible to find acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS), while polybutadiene terephthalate (PBT) was contained in the printed circuit boards (PCBs). Taking into account this identification, a ternary polymer mixture of ABS-HIPS-PBT was prepared as a representative sample of the thermoplastic fraction contained in WEEE (real WEEE sample). From the thermal characterization (proximate and ultimate analysis, high heating value (HHV) direct measurement and Energy-Dispersive-X-Ray-Fluorescence analysis (ED-XRF)) the only polymer whose properties sensibly differ from the analogous virgin polymer is the one contained in PCBs. A kinetic analysis of pyrolysis occurring on the three components and on their ternary mixture was performed using a thermogravimetry (TG) apparatus in argon atmosphere under non isothermal conditions. Triplicates of TG experiments at four heating rates of 2, 5, 10 and 15 K min−1 were carried out and two different model-free approaches were adopted, namely the Kissinger and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall methods in order to determine the activation energy E (as a single mean value or as a function of the degree of conversion α). The conversion dependencies of both activation energy and pre-exponential factors were determined as well as the reaction model, representing the reaction mechanism. The suitability of the models selected was tested using the Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) score, being the geometric model R3 the best found for pyrolysis of ABS, HIPS and real WEEE samples, while PBT sample showed an uncertainty between the R3 and the diffusion D2 model. The reaction time values to achieve the maximum pyrolysis rate in the three main components and in the real WEEE sample were also calculated.","The study involves lab-scale thermogravimetric pyrolysis of waste plastics (ABS, HIPS, PBT) from electronic waste, with measurable kinetic data, product yield relationships, and analytical characterization."
"Pyrolysis of model plastic component polypropylene to hydrogen over mesoporous alumina catalysts: Effect of pluronic structure directing agents Catalytic pyrolysis of the large and complex polymeric structure of plastic to gaseous fuel has been investigated in this work. A two-stage pyrolytic system is reported for cracking model waste plastic, polypropylene, over mesoporous alumina catalyst to produce H2 and CH4. The experiments have been conducted in the temperature range of 750–900 °C and various catalyst-to-plastic ratios under atmospheric pressure. The alumina-based catalysts were synthesized via the one-pot evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method using four different structure-directing agents (SDA) namely PEG-1000, PEG-4000, P123, and F127 to understand the effect on catalytic properties and performance evaluation. Results revealed that the structured directing agents improve the catalyst's surface properties and affect the product yield. All synthesized catalysts were characterized for crystallinity, topography, and surface properties using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Pyridine-Transmission Fourier transform infrared (Py-FTIR) spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. A significant effect of SDA was observed on the surface area of the synthesized mesoporous alumina (SMA) catalyst. The decreasing order in terms of the surface area of the SMA is SMAF127 >SMAP40 >SMAP123 >SMAP10> Alumina (without SDA). Approximately, a tenfold increase in surface area was observed with SMAF127 (mesoporous alumina) compared to non-mesoporous alumina. A maximum yield of hydrogen∼40.79 mmol/gram polypropylene was obtained with a catalyst-plastic (C/P) ratio of 1:2.5 at a temperature of 900 °C using SMAF127 owing to its high surface area, and other physiochemical properties.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a waste plastic, in a lab-scale reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization."
"Delving into textile fast pyrolysis: A holistic study on the effects of feedstock and temperature variability Perpetual fast fashion wave, dismal global recycling rate, and poor circularity of textiles urged sustainable textile waste disposal solution in lieu of incineration and landfilling. Herein, textile fast pyrolysis was mooted as a promising solution by dint of its fast disposal rate, mild pollutant emission, and multiple value-added products formation. Following ill-defined thermochemical behaviour of individual textiles, in-depth experimental exploration on textile fast pyrolysis was supplemented by feedstock characterization, product distribution, and product characterization to unravel the effects of feedstock (natural/synthetic) and temperature (500–900oC) variability on pyrolysis products. Textile fast pyrolysis harnessed pyrogas with two variable products, viz. retrievable chars and oils [natural textiles: cotton (C), denim (D), & cashmere/plant fibre (CP)] or non-retrievable chars and waxes [synthetic textiles: polyester (P), P/acrylic (PA), & P/cotton (PC)]. Melting and high aromaticity of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) rendered the synthesis of non-retrievable chars and waxes, separately. Given monotonic char yields (7.31–24.19 wt%) reduction with temperature, the oil/wax (53.19–75.19/60.46–70.52 wt%) and gas (13.44–33.67 wt%) yields were negatively correlated to each other. Twill-woven network of D contributed to exclusively high BET surface area of D chars (132.64–217.10 m2/g). All natural textile chars (28.56–32.88 MJ) exhibited comparable higher heating value (HHV) to commercial coals/coke (14.77–34.39 MJ/kg) and biochars (7.26–33.37 MJ/kg). Compared to the commercial fuels, raw textile oils (incombustible-10.14 MJ/kg) and textile waxes (15.88–23.18 MJ/kg) were inferior fuels with low HHV. Nonetheless, cotton (C & D) oils, CP oils, and P-based textile waxes had respective enriched content of levoglucosan (6.85–34.38 area%), triacetoneamine (6.22–21.09 area%), and benzoic acid (16.37–46.55 area%). Considering noteworthy H2 formation data sets (700–900oC; C700 only), natural textile pyrogas (62.75–79.02%) had greater syngas (H2 & CO) composition than synthetic textile pyrogas (62.48–68.23%). At optimal temperature of 900oC, textile fast pyrolysis generated pyrogas with H2:CO ratios (1.30–3.49 ≈ 2) that nearly ideal for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Conversely, textile fast pyrolysis also emitted pollutant gases that differ between natural (NH3, N2O, NO, & SO2) and synthetic [NH3 (excluding P), N2O, & NO2] textiles.","The study involves lab-scale fast pyrolysis of synthetic and natural textiles, which are commercial plastic or textile waste materials, with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed product characterization."
"Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over HZSM5 and HUSY zeolites in a batch reactor under dynamic conditions The thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE over HZSM5 and HUSY have been studied under dynamic conditions in a batch reactor. The products evolved have been analyzed, and results have been compared with those found in the bibliography. Particular attention was paid to any coincidences and differences encountered. The yields of gases, liquids and waxes for all the systems employed are presented, along with the composition of each fraction. The general carbon number distribution is shown, as well as the carbon number distribution for the main compounds present in the gaseous and the liquid fractions. Finally, the 10 major compounds obtained for each system are described.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE and HDPE) using catalysts in a batch reactor, with measurable product yields and detailed product composition analysis."
"Enhancement of biofuel quality via conventional and catalytic co-pyrolysis of bamboo with polystyrene in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor: Coupled experiments and artificial neural network modeling Experiments and artificial neural network modeling were performed to investigate the effect of operating parameters (temperature, fluidization velocity, and particle size) and catalysts (HZSM-5, red mud, Fe2O3, and dolomite) on co-pyrolysis of bamboo with polystyrene (PS) in a fluidized bed reactor for upgrading bio-oil. The synergistic effect was revealed by analyzing products via various analytical techniques and differences between theoretical and actual co-pyrolysis results. Under the H2-donor source from PS, co-pyrolysis reduced the O content while enhancing the content of aromatic hydrocarbons and higher heating value (HHV) of oil. Depending on the type of catalyst, characteristics and yield of the co-pyrolysis oil were affected along with the proposed reaction pathways. Dolomite was assessed as the most effective catalyst for improving oil quality, with the highest HHV (34.1 MJ/kg) and highest pH value (5.0). An artificial neural network using a back propagation algorithm in Matlab software was applied to predict the liquid yield and HHV of oil. The ANN15 model (15 neurons in the hidden layer) was found to be the best model in validating experimental data with mean deviations of 1.75 % for liquid yield and 0.87 % for HHV of oil.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (a waste plastic) with bamboo in a fluidized bed reactor, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and fuel quality analysis including HHV and aromatic content."
"Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste over zeolite- and sodium-based catalysts for enhanced yields of hydrocarbon products Ex-situ co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse pith and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated over zeolite-based catalysts using a tandem micro-reactor at an optimised temperature of 700 °C. A combination of zeolite (HZSM-5) and sodium carbonate/gamma-alumina served as effective catalysts for 18% more oxygen removal than HZSM-5 alone. The combined catalysts led to improved yields of aromatic (8.7%) and olefinic (6.9%) compounds. Carbon yields of 20.3% total aromatics, 18.3% BTXE (benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene), 17% olefins, and 7% phenols were achieved under optimal conditions of 700 °C, a pith (biomass) to PET ratio of 4 and an HZSM-5 to sodium carbonate/gamma-alumina ratio of 5. The catalytic presence of sodium prevented coke formation, which has been a major cause of deactivation of zeolite catalysts during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. This finding indicates that the catalyst combination as well as biomass/plastic mixtures used in this work can lead to both high yields of valuable aromatic chemicals and potentially, extended catalyst life time.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of plastic waste (PET) and biomass in a tandem micro-reactor with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Maximizing olefin production via steam cracking of distilled pyrolysis oils from difficult-to-recycle municipal plastic waste and marine litter Plastic waste is steadily polluting oceans and environments. Even if collected, most waste is still predominantly incinerated for energy recovery at the cost of CO2. Chemical recycling can contribute to the transition towards a circular economy with pyrolysis combined with steam cracking being the favored recycling option for the time being. However, today, the high variety and contamination of real waste remains the biggest challenge. This is especially relevant for waste fractions which are difficult or even impossible to recycle mechanically such as highly mixed municipal plastic waste or marine litter. In this work, we studied the detailed composition and the steam cracking performance of distilled pyrolysis oil fractions in the naphtha-range of two highly relevant waste fractions: mixed municipal plastic waste (MPW) considered unsuitable for mechanical recycling and marine litter (ML) collected from the sea bottom. Advanced analytical techniques including comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) coupled with various detectors and inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were applied to characterize the feedstocks and to understand how their properties affect the steam cracking performance. Both waste-derived naphtha fractions were rich in olefins and aromatics (~70% in MPW naphtha and ~51% in ML naphtha) next to traces of nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine and metals. ICP-MS analyses showed that sodium, potassium, silicon and iron were the most crucial metals that should be removed in further upgrading steps. Steam cracking of the waste-derived naphtha fractions resulted in lower light olefin yields compared to fossil naphtha used as benchmark, due to secondary reactions of aromatics and olefins. Coke formation of ML naphtha was slightly increased compared to fossil naphtha (+ ~50%), while that of MPW naphtha was more than ~180% higher. It was concluded that mild upgrading of the waste-derived naphtha fractions or dilution with fossil feedstocks is sufficient to provide feedstocks suitable for industrial steam cracking.","The study involves pyrolysis of mixed municipal plastic waste and marine litter, with experimental characterization of pyrolysis oil fractions and measurable product yields and compositions."
"Coupling property-optimized Ru/Beta catalysts with advanced open batch distillation reactors for waste polyethylene hydrocracking Plastic waste, particularly from polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE), poses an escalating environmental burden due to its chemical inertness and volume. Pyrolysis is commercialized process that offers a practical solution for recycling plastic waste, but it is limited by high temperature requirements, substantial energy consumption, and high proportion of olefinic products. Hydrocracking with bifunctional catalysts under optimized conditions presents a promising alternative. Here, we developed a property-optimized Ru/Beta catalyst system combined with a pressurized open batch distillation reactor for the selective hydrocracking of waste PE into C5–C30 hydrocarbons. Zeolite Beta supports with varied Si/Al ratios and crystal sizes were synthesized to control Brønsted acid site distribution and external surface area. The controlled properties influenced Ru nanoparticle dispersion, hydrogen activation, and overall catalytic activity. Nano-sized zeolite Beta supports exhibited the highest Ru dispersion and facilitated efficient hydrocracking. The open batch reactor configuration enabled real-time vapor-phase separation of volatile products, minimizing secondary cracking. Under optimized conditions (280 °C, 40 H2 bar), Ru/nanosized Beta with (Si/Al=10) achieved over an 80 % PE conversion and a 50 % selectivity toward C5–C30 liquid hydrocarbons. Product analysis using GC-FID, GPC, and ¹H NMR confirmed the formation of branched alkanes with a narrow molecular weight distribution in the C5–C15 range. This work underscores the critical role of metal–acid site balance, nanoscale catalyst engineering, and dynamic reactor operation in achieving selective and efficient polyolefin hydrocracking.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste polyethylene using a catalyst and reactor system, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and defined reaction conditions."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of polyoleﬁn and multilayer packaging based waste plastics: A pilot scale study The catalytic pyrolysis of different types of polyoleﬁn and multilayer packaging based plastic wastes in the presence of commercial zeolite catalyst was studied in the batch pilot scale reactor. Different types of multi-layer plastics such as biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP), metalized biaxial oriented polypropylene layers (MET/BOPP), poly ethylene terepthalate (PET), metalized polyethylene-terepthalate (MET/PET), PET combined polyethylene (PET/PE) and mixed polyolefin plastic wastes obtained from the municipal corporation were pyrolyzed to determine the oil, gas and char distribution. BOPP based plastic waste exhibited higher oil yield and calorific value (65–70%, 45.14 KJ/g) compared to PET based MLPs (17.8 %, 30 KJ/g) and laminated metalized plastics (13 %, 37 KJ/g). Modifying the feed composition by mixing of polyolefins-based waste plastics with PET based MLPs and BOPP/MET BOPP doubled the liquid yield and notably altered the physicochemical characterization of the resulted pyrolysis oil. Char yield in the polyolefins-based waste is observed to be lesser than the MLP based waste plastics. GC–MS analysis revealed the percentage area of hydrocarbons compounds of the pyrolysis oil obtained from PET based MLP experiments contains high fractions of medium and heavier range hydrocarbons (C11 – C20, C21 – C30). Sulfur content in the oil from different MLPs was measured as below the detection limit. Functional groups of hydrocarbons of oil were analyzed using FT-IR. Solids were characterized for the presence of heavy metals such as Al, Cr, Cu, Co, Pd, and Ni.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (polyolefins and multilayer packaging) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of oil composition and solids."
"Effect of co-feeding HDPE on the product distribution in the hydrocracking of VGO The hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mixed with vacuum gasoil (VGO) (20 wt% HDPE) has been investigated with the aim of assessing this valorization strategy to obtain products suitable to be used as commercial fuel blending streams. The runs have been conducted in a batch reactor at: 400–440 °C; 80 bar; catalyst to feed ratio, 10 gcat gfeed −1; and reaction time, 2 h. Using three different catalysts, PtPd/Y, NiW/Y and NiMo/SA, the effect of the temperature and the composition of the products have been analyzed, comparing obtained results in the hydrocracking of VGO with those obtained for the HDPE/VGO blend. The products distribution has been quantified determining the yields of different lumps, defined according to their boiling point range: gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The concentration of the families of compounds has been also determined: paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics (mono-, di- and poly-). Obtained results reveal that the addition of HDPE to the VGO is a promising way to valorize the HDPE, improving the conversion of VGO while producing interesting valuable products. Indeed, at 440 °C and with PtPd/Y catalyst total conversion of HDPE has been obtained, with a naphtha yield of 31.8 wt%.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE mixed with VGO, with measurable product yields and detailed characterization of product composition and reactor conditions."
"Soil contamination by microplastics in relation to local agricultural development as revealed by FTIR, ICP-MS and pyrolysis-GC/MS Plastic film mulching and use of wastewaters for irrigation have been common agricultural practices for over half a century in Tunisia, especially in arid regions, resulting in the undesired creation of a pathway for microplastics (MPs) to enter farmland soil. In order to assess the extent and characteristics of soil contamination by MPs in the Moknine province, an area of intensive agricultural practices, 16 farmland soil samples were collected and characterized. The total concentration of targeted MPs was 50–880 items/kg; among them, the most common MPs type being polypropylene (PP), mainly occurring as white/transparent fibers with small size (cross section <0.3 mm). SEM images of MPs surfaces revealed multiple features related to environmental exposure and degradation. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and pyrolysis-GC/MS analyses enabled the accurate identification of MPs separated from the embedding soil micro- and macro-aggregates. Finally, contamination of the polymeric microparticles with a broad range of metals was found by ICP-MS analysis, suggesting that MPs can be vectors for transporting heavy metals in the soil and indicators of soil contamination as a result of mismanagement of industrial wastewaters.","The study involves pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis of microplastics extracted from soil, which constitutes lab-scale experimental work with measurable analytical data on polymer identification and degradation products."
"Pyrolysis study of waste phenolic fibre-reinforced plastic by thermogravimetry/Fourier transform infrared/mass spectrometry analysis Pyrolysis is considered to be a promising method to dispose waste plastics by thermal cracking into chemicals. Previous studies focus on pyrolysis recycling of waste thermoplastics. The pyrolysis of waste thermosetting plastics, which may be different from that of waste thermoplastics, receives little attention. In order to provide guidance for reactor design and thermo-chemical process management for the pyrolysis recycling of waste thermosetting plastics, the pyrolysis kinetics, volatile products and reaction mechanisms of one typical waste thermosetting plastics namely phenolic fibre-reinforced plastic (phenolic FRP) are studied in the present study. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and online TGA-FTIR-mass spectra (MS) analyses are employed. Results indicate that the pyrolysis of waste phenolic FRP in inert atmosphere may be divided into two stages with the threshold conversion rate of 0.2. The average values of activation energy in the first, second and whole pyrolysis process were 174.66 kJ/mol, 233.62 kJ/mol and 223.22 kJ/mol, respectively. The crosslinking between phenol derivatives and breakage of branched chain may result in the occurrence of the first stage, while the occurrence of the second stage may be due to the breakage of chain backbone and oxidation of methylene and hydroxymethyl. Four kinds of gases including H2O, alcohols, aliphatic compounds and carboxylic acids mainly constitute the volatile products in the first stage. The volatile products in the second stage mainly consist of CO, CO2, carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds. The amount of the volatile products in the second stage is much larger than that in the first stage. The maximum amount of these seven gases in the order of most to least is CO2 > CO > alcohols > carboxylic acids > aliphatic compounds > water vapour > aromatic compounds. It may be better to recover the waste phenolic FRP for valuable gases either as fuel or chemical feedstock in the first stage than the second stage.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste phenolic fiber-reinforced plastic (a commercial thermosetting plastic) using TGA, FTIR, and MS analyses, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed volatile product composition."
"Hydrogen-rich gas production by continuous pyrolysis and in-line catalytic reforming of pine wood waste and HDPE mixtures The continuous pyrolysis-reforming of pine sawdust and high density polyethylene mixtures (25, 50 and 75wt% HDPE) has been performed in a two-stage reaction system provided with a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) and a fluidized bed reactor. The influence HDPE co-feeding has on the conversion, yields and composition of the reforming outlet stream and catalyst deactivation has been studied at a reforming temperature of 700°C, with a space time of 16.7gcat mingfeeding −1 and a steam/(biomass+HDPE) mass ratio of 4, and a comparison has been made between these results and those recorded by feeding pine sawdust and HDPE separately. Co-feeding plastics enhances the hydrogen production, which increases from 10.9g of H2 per 100g of feed (only pine sawdust in the feed) to 37.3g of H2 per 100g of feed (only HDPE in the feed). Catalyst deactivation by coke is attenuated when HDPE is co-fed due to the lower content of oxygenated compounds in the reaction environment. The higher yield of hydrogen achieved with this two-step (pyrolysis-reforming) strategy, its ability to jointly valorise biomass and plastic mixtures and the lower temperatures required compared to gasification make this promising process for producing H2 from renewable raw materials and wastes.",The study involves lab-scale continuous pyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) in a two-stage system with measurable hydrogen yields and catalyst performance data.
"Characterization of tars from recycling of PHA bioplastic and synthetic plastics using fast pyrolysis The aim of this study was to investigate the pyrolysis products of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRC), and block co-polymers (PS-b-P2VP and PS-b-P4VP). The studied PHA samples were produced at temperatures of 15 and 50 oC (PHA15 and PHA50), and commercially obtained from GlasPort Bio (PHAc). Initially, PHA samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to determine the molecular weight, and structure of the polymers. Thermal techniques such as thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed for PHA, CFRC, and block co-polymers to investigate the degradation temperature range and thermal stability of samples. Fast pyrolysis (500 oC, ∼102 °C s−1) experiments were conducted for all samples in a wire mesh reactor to investigate tar products and char yields. The tar compositions were investigated by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and statistical modeling was performed. The char yields of block co-polymers and PHA samples (<2 wt. %) were unequivocally less than that of the PET sample (~10.7 wt. %). All PHA compounds contained a large fraction of ethyl cyclopropane carboxylate (~ 38–58 %), whereas PAH15 and PHA50 additionally showed a large quantity of 2-butenoic acid (~8–12 %). The PHAc sample indicated the presence of considerably high amount of methyl ester (~15 %), butyl citrate (~12.9 %), and tributyl ester (~17 %). The compositional analyses of the liquid fraction of the PET and block co-polymers have shown carcinogenic and toxic properties. Pyrolysis removed matrices in the CRFC composites which is an indication of potential recovery of the original fibers.","The study involves lab-scale fast pyrolysis of waste plastics (PHA, PET, CFRC, and block co-polymers) with measurable product yields, char yields, and detailed GC–MS analysis of tar products, confirming experimental data and plastic pyrolysis."
"Pyrolysis of excavated waste from landfill mining: Characterisation of the process products The current transition to a circular economy model laid the foundations for the development of the Enhanced Landfill Mining concept. Hitherto, a few studies have been performed on the thermochemical valorisation of excavated waste, of which a majority concern incineration or gasification. Nonetheless, no previous studies on excavated waste pyrolysis, including the characterisation of the process products, have been identified. Ergo, this study aims at filling this knowledge gap. The pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel formed from excavated waste was performed in a lab-scale reactor in the temperature range of 400–700 °C. The non-condensable products (non-condensables) were analysed using Micro GC, whereas the condensable products (condensables) were characterised using GC/MS. Additionally, the distribution of C, H, N, S, O, and Cl among the process products was analysed. The high content of C2–C3 hydrocarbons was detected in non-condensables, whereas the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was detected among condensable products. However, due to feedstock complex thermal decomposition pattern, no overall tendency, covering the process product properties in relation to the process temperature, can be determined. These fluctuations of composition, therefore, have to be taken into account in the planning of the future utilisation of the excavated waste pyrolysis products. Moreover, two possible risks, connected with the further process products utilisation, were identified – namely, chlorine forming primarily organic compounds and sulphur forming mostly gaseous compounds (H2S).","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of excavated waste (a form of mixed plastic waste) with measurable product yields, temperature-dependent analysis, and detailed characterization of condensable and non-condensable products using GC/MS and Micro GC."
"End-of-life wind turbine blades as a resource: A comparative study of pyrolysis and combustion The transition to a low-carbon economy has accelerated wind energy installations. However, managing waste wind turbine blades (WTBs) remains a challenge due to their composite nature and limited regulations. This study explores the thermochemical recovery of WTBs via pyrolysis and combustion, focusing on gaseous emissions, pyrolysis oil, pyrochar morphology and ash. WTBs exhibit low carbon content (29.5 wt%), a heating value of 12 MJ/kg, and high ash content (58 wt%), meeting the minimum fuel threshold for cement production but not EN 15359 standards. Pyrolysis tests revealed decomposition behavior (Tonset: 348 °C, Tpeak: 390 °C, Toffset:421 °C) with a 39.3 % conversion rate. TG-FTIR analysis identified alcohols, esters, phenolics, and carbonyl groups, with key volatiles released at 366–417 °C. Pyrolysis oil (C6-C40, dominated by C15) was rich in Bisphenol A derivatives, suitable for resin production. Pyrochar, primarily glass fiber, exhibited low carbon content, making it suitable as a concrete or polymer additive. Combustion tests showed a mean ignition temperature of 276 °C, burnout at 686.5 °C, and moderate combustibility index. CO2 emissions peaked between 421 and 572 °C. Ash morphology revealed glass fibers surrounded by loosely adherent ash. These findings support WTB valorization, promoting energy and material recovery while addressing environmental concerns.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste wind turbine blades, a composite plastic material, with measurable yields, temperature–yield relationships, product composition analysis, and reactor conditions."
"Disposal of plastic mulching film through CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis as a strategic means for microplastic mitigation Conventional disposal processes (incineration and landfilling) of agricultural plastic wastes release harmful chemicals and microplastics into our ecosystems. To provide a disposal platform not releasing harmful chemicals, pyrolysis of a representative agricultural plastic waste was proposed in this study. Spent plastic mulching film (SMF) was used as a model waste compound. To make pyrolysis process more environmentally benign, CO2 was used as a raw material in pyrolysis of SMF. H2 and hydrocarbons were produced from pyrolysis of SMF under the inert (N2) and CO2 conditions, because SMF is composed of polyethylene. To enhance conversion of hydrocarbons into H2, catalytic pyrolysis of SMF was conducted over Ni/SiO2. Compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis, total concentration of pyrolytic gases was enhanced up to 3.1 and 11.3 times under N2 and CO2 conditions, respectively. The gas phase reactions between CO2 and hydrocarbons led to formation of CO, which enhanced production of pyrolytic gases under the CO2 condition. Moreover, gas phase reactions resulted in less production of pyrolytic oil from CO2 condition (15.9 wt%) in reference to the N2 condition (22.6 wt%). All experimental results confirmed that CO2 and SMF can be used as useful feedstocks to produce value-added products. Environmental Implication Plastic waste used from a sector of agriculture is incinerated or/and landfilled, generating hazardous microplastic and volatile compounds into the environment. Thus, an environmentally friendly process for plastic waste materials in the agricultural industry is required. This study converted a spent plastic mulching film (SMF), broadly used for plastic greenhouse, into value-added syngas through catalytic pyrolysis. CO2 was used as a reactant. We found that concentration of CO2 was key to improve syngas formation from pyrolysis of SMF. Thus, this study suggested that CO2/SMF are used as useful feedstocks through catalytic pyrolysis, while they were previously discarded as waste materials","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of spent plastic mulching film (SMF), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, gas composition analysis, and catalyst performance data under varying conditions."
"Evaluation of process parameters on high-density polyethylene hydro-liquefaction products The hydro-liquefaction of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was studied in the absence of a solvent. The influence of reaction temperature (400–440 °C), initial H2 pressure (1–4 MPa), and reaction time (2–6 h) on the product was investigated using Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst. Results showed that increased reaction temperature and time promoted hydrocarbon cracking, thereby favoring the enhancement of C7–C16 selectivity, whereas the high initial H2 pressure (4 MPa) preferentially facilitated the production of C17–C27 hydrocarbons and improved alkene hydrogenation. The effect of catalyst support (Al2O3, SAPO-11, and HZSM-5) was also examined. Al2O3 presented the highest liquid yield because of its weak acidity, with the liquid product dominated by n-alkanes (78.88%), whereas the yield of the liquid obtained from HZSM-5 as a catalyst support was the lowest, and aromatics was the major component (56.75%). SAPO-11 exhibited excellent selectivity for iso-alkanes, which improved the quality of the liquid oil. Meanwhile, liquid oil obtained using SAPO-11 was compliant with commercial jet-fuel standards and can be directly used as a jet-fuel additive. From this perspective, the hydro-liquefaction is a technology with potential for energy recovery from waste plastic.","The study involves lab-scale experimental hydro-liquefaction of HDPE plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Kinetic study of the flash pyrolysis of municipal solid waste in a fluidized bed reactor at high temperature A kinetic study of the pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) in a fluidized bed reactor was carried out. The MSW pellets are discharged onto the fluidized sand bed; in the upper part of the reactor the volatiles evolved from primary reactions underwent secondary cracking reactions. A correlation model was applied to simulate the primary and secondary reactions as well as the heat transfer process. The experimental yields of the total gases obtained in 49 runs performed at 700, 750, 800 and 850 °C fitted satisfactorily using a flexible simplex method. The values of the kinetic parameters of secondary reaction, the heat transfer coefficient from the bed to the sample and the ratio “secondary gas yield/primary tars yield” were optimised. The values of the secondary kinetic parameters, which showed a great inter-relation with those of the primary reactions, were within the range of the values proposed in literature for other biomass tar cracking.","The study involves lab-scale experimental flash pyrolysis of municipal solid waste, a mixture containing waste plastics, with measurable product yields and kinetic parameter optimization at defined temperatures."
"Value added hydrocarbons obtained by pyrolysis of contaminated waste plastics in horizontal tubular reactor: In situ upgrading of the products by chlorine capture Municipal plastic waste (mixtures of high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride) was pyrolyzed in a pilot-scale horizontal tubular reactor. To increase the yield of volatile and to improve the product properties (e.g. reduced chlorine content, better storage and transportation) red mud, calcium hydroxide, and nickel loaded zeolite catalysts were used. The nickel loaded synthetic zeolite catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation. Catalysts with high synthetic zeolite content can increase the yields of light oil roughly by 50%. The char formation was slight under the same used conditions. In case of catalyst free pyrolysis, the gases and light oil contained significant amount of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can occur further corrosion problems. The stability of light oil was followed by aging test. Slight formations of polymerized compounds from unsaturated hydrocarbons were found after the treating in case of catalytic pyrolysis. However, the total acidic number was moderate-high without catalyst. Regarding the catalysts, the concentration of chlorinated compounds can be drastically reduced in the presence of catalysts. Especially, when high ratios of the red mud and calcium hydroxide were used. Therefore, the total acid number could be also reduced. Higher synthetic zeolite ratio in the catalyst mixture led to favorable hydrocarbon composition of products, e.g. higher concentration of branched compounds or lower C/H ratio.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (PE, PP, PVC) in a horizontal tubular reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of hydrocarbon composition and chlorine content."
"Low-temperature upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate into fuel additives over diffusion-enhanced hollow Ru/ZSM-5 The growing accumulation of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has raised great concern about its effective upcycling. Catalytic fast pyrolysis is a promising method for selectively upcycling of waste PET into aromatics. However, the high temperature and poor mass transfer performance remain considerably challenging. In this research, a diffusion-enhanced hollow ZSM-5 catalyst with Ru modification was designed for low-temperature valorization of waste PET into aromatics. Ru species significantly enhanced the primary depolymerization of long-chain polymers by generating abundant Lewis acid sites, which markedly increased the aromatics content. Additionally, the mesopore-rich structure formed after Ru-modification improved diffusion capacity of products effectively. The existing of active Ru0 species was beneficial to the hydro-upgrading of oxygen-containing intermediates, therefore monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) content and hydrogen atom utilization increased to a great extent. More gratifyingly, the pyrolysis temperature for preparing aromatics from waste PET was obviously lowered, probably due to the synergistic effect of diffusion-enhanced structure and Ru modification. Ru/ZH exhibited higher aromatics yield of 46.4 wt% with selectivity of 95.3 % at 500 °C, resulting in a significant mass yield increase of 93.1 % compared to unmodified hollow ZSM-5 (24.0 wt%). Finally, the plausible pathway for PET-to-aromatics via catalytic fast pyrolysis over Ru/ZH was proposed.","The study involves catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste PET, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, temperature-dependent performance, and product composition analysis."
"Study of the thermal behavior, kinetics, and product characterization of biomass and low-density polyethylene co-pyrolysis by thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis-GC/MS The present study aims to improve the yields and selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass by the addition of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which has a higher hydrogen-carbon ratio than biomass. We have investigated the thermal decomposition behavior and kinetics, as well as the product distribution, of the co-pyrolysis of biomass (cellulose and pine sawdust) and plastic (LDPE) both with and without a catalyst (HZSM-5) using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Our results, based on the weight loss difference (△W), show that there is a positive and synergistic interaction between the biomass and LDPE. After the addition of LDPE, the synergistic reactions inhibited catalyst coking effectively and decreased the formation of solid residues. In addition, the ZSM-5 catalyst improved the reaction activity and reduced the activation energy, although the reaction mechanism is not changed. At the same time, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method was used to fit the kinetic data for both non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE, and the activation energies (E a) of the cellulose + LDPE + catalyst and pine + LDPE + catalyst systems were found to be 168.81 and 185.87 kJ/mol, respectively. The co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE effectively improved the yield and selectivity of aromatics and increased the selectivity for benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene (BTXE). The addition of LDPE can effectively improve the selectivity for naphthalene family products (methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and decrease the content of aromatic hydrocarbons larger than C10.","The study involves lab-scale experimental co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with biomass using TGA and Py-GC/MS, reporting measurable product yields, kinetic parameters, and catalyst performance."
"Chemical recycling of poly(methyl methacrylate) by pyrolysis. Potential use of the liquid fraction as a raw material for the reproduction of the polymer Pyrolysis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was studied as an effective way to recycle this polymer and recover its monomer methyl methacrylate (MMA). Experiments were carried out in a laboratory fixed bed reactor using either a model polymer or a commercial product based on PMMA as feedstock. Gaseous and liquid products obtained from polymer degradation were analysed and it was found that the oil fraction constituted mainly of the MMA monomer. Thus, the possibility of directly using the liquid product for the reproduction of the polymer was further investigated. Polymerizations accomplished in a differential scanning calorimeter using azo-bis-isobutyronitrile as initiator and different reaction temperatures. Results obtained were compared to corresponding data from polymerization of neat monomer. It was found that the pyrolysis liquid fraction can be polymerized and produce a polymer similar to the original PMMA. However, even small amounts of other organic compounds (mainly methyl esters) included in this fraction act as non-ideal reaction retarders, altering the reaction rate curve and lowering the glass transition temperature and the average molecular weight of the polymer produced.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of commercial PMMA plastic, with measured product yields and composition analysis, including characterization of the liquid fraction as a monomer-rich oil suitable for repolymerization."
"Effect of fractional distillation pretreatment on fuel quality of plastic waste pyrolytic oils Today, the amount of plastic waste is increasing due to the use of more plastic. Since these wastes are composed of complex chemical compounds, when they are stored, they are difficult to degrade in the air, water and soil environment and pose a serious environmental problem. One of the disposal methods of plastic waste is pyrolysis, where valuable and useful products are obtained. The pyrolytic oil products formed in the pyrolysis process can also be evaluated with their rich hydrocarbon compositions in the production of chemicals, energy production and fuel production. However, in order to evaluate this product in various fields, it would be good to improve the product quality with some pre-processes. In this study, the quality of HDPE and LDPE type pyrolytic oils was improved by fractional distillation. Distillation fractions usability as fuel was examined. By measuring the quality parameters of the bottom and distilled fraction obtained from the fraction process, its usability as gasoline (bottoms fraction) and fuel oil (distillate fraction) were evaluated according to TS EN 2177 and TS EN 228 standards, respectively. LDPE distillation efficiencies are higher than HDPE distillation efficiencies as LDPE pyrolytic oils are distilled more easily. The sulfur content of the distilled fractions obtained after distillation fell below limit values ​​and showed a positive situation in terms of the use of distilled products as gasoline. HDPE300, HDPE400, HDPE500 and HDPE600 distillate fractions provided the standard / limit values ​​given in TS EN 228 standards in terms of all parameters considered in the study. Similarly, in terms of all quality parameters considered, HDPE300, HDPE400 and LDPE500, LDPE600 and LDPE700 bottom fractions are compatible with the standard / limit values ​​given in TS 2177 standards.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of HDPE and LDPE waste plastics, with measurable product yields and fuel quality parameters analyzed according to standardized fuel specifications."
"Prospects for the utilization of bio-oil-derived chemicals generated via co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) The global concern about plastic is a matter of great importance. Coprocessing biomass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through pyrolysis can represent a strategy to reuse these materials, transforming them into products of industrial interest. Thus, this study aims to understand the influence of the co-pyrolysis of biomass and PET on bio-oil (BO). The PET quantities used were 0 %, 15 %, and 25 % of the eucalyptus biomass dry basis. The co-pyrolysis was performed in a fixed-bed reactor in a low-oxygen atmosphere without gas entry at a final temperature of 450°C and three heating rates (1, 3, and 5°C.min−1). The liquid fraction underwent double distillation, producing purified bio-oil (BOP) with yields of 54 %, 57 %, and 55 %, respectively, influenced solely by the heating rates of 1, 3, and 5°C min−1. After purification, BOP's pH, density, and viscosity were analyzed. The chemical composition of BOP was subject to GC-MS analysis. The addition of PET and the variation in heating rate influenced the composition of the BOP produced. The liquid density decreased as the PET proportion in the biomass increased. The heating rate increase reduced BOP's pH from 2.75 to 2.61. Therefore, lower heating rates and PET proportions tend to increase the viscosity of BOP. Ketones were the most representative organic compounds in all evaluated materials, followed by phenols, furans, and pyrans.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of mixed plastic (PET) and biomass, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of bio-oil composition."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene to produce iso-alkane sustainable aviation fuel fractions: Comparison of in-situ and ex-situ pyrolysis modes It is crucial to develop a simple and rapid process for producing iso-alkane-rich sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without relying on external hydrogen supply. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) for SAF fractions production using zeolite catalysts including HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and MCM-41 in both in-situ and ex-situ modes. The results demonstrate that the HY catalyst yields the highest isomeric SAF fractions (31 area%) in the in-situ mode, whereas the HBeta exhibited maximal aromatic SAF selectivity (65 area%) in ex-situ mode, with complete absence of iso-alkanes. In the in-situ mode, the brief contact between iso-alkanes and acid sites on catalyst effectively suppresses the secondary cracking. However, for zeolites such as ZSM-5 with high acid concentration, isomerized alkanes are still difficult to retain. These results indicate that the effective production of iso-alkanes must be conducted under in-situ mode and requires zeolites with well-balanced acidity. The optimized distribution of acid sites in HY zeolite is found to be LAS/BAS = 3.42, which enhanced the production of iso-alkanes. Moreover, while the type of SAF fractions remained unchanged regardless of the polyolefin plastic used, polypropylene (PP) exhibited greater aromatic selectivity owing to its methyl-branched structure. This work provides a robust framework for converting plastic wastes into SAF, emphasizing acid sites and pyrolysis modes as key enablers.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Catalytic pyrolysis of film waste over Co/Ni pillared montmorillonites towards H2 production The transformation of plastic waste into valuable fuel products via catalytic pyrolysis is a promising and eco-friendly strategy. Herein, a series of Co/Ni pillared montmorillonites were developed as low-cost and effective catalysts for the pyrolysis of post-consumer film waste, which is one of the representative plastic wastes in nature. The best-performing catalyst produced 80.2% of liquid product, with a high selectivity of 43.5% of hydrocarbons at C10–C13 range, and 42.0 vol% of H2 which is nearly increased by 40-fold as compared to that in non-catalytic run. The improved results were ascribed to the pillared structure, the oxidation state of Co/Ni, and the distribution of acid sites. Particularly, the Lewis acidity (which governs the cyclization and alkanisation) coupled with high surface area and uniform dispersion of transition metallic sites, were found to promote the selectivity of condensable product. The pyrolytic mechanism towards H2 production was explored by theoretical calculations. The lattice oxygen bonded to both Ni and Co in an octahedral environment was found to promote the adsorption of the fragment of polymer in dehydrogenation. Additionally, the solid residues are potentially applied for the production of valuable carbonaceous materials since they displayed high heating value. This work is expected to provide a direction for the development of pyrolysis technology for fuel production with sustainability and economic viability.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of post-consumer film waste (a commercial plastic) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Influence of polypropylene and high-density polyethylene on isothermal pyrolytic degradation of discarded bakelite: Kinetic analysis and batch pyrolysis studies The recycling of thermosetting plastics such as discarded bakelite poses greater challenges than thermoplastic polymers like polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), particularly through pyrolysis requiring specialized reactors. This study examines the isothermal thermal degradation kinetics and batch pyrolysis behaviors of bakelite, along with its blends with PP and HDPE, emphasizing the characterization of pyrolytic oils for designing optimized reactors. For the study on isothermal thermal degradation kinetics, isothermal thermogravimetric analysis was performed at specified temperatures (300, 350, 400, 450, and 500°C), chosen based on the predominant non-isothermal degradation behavior of bakelite. The batch pyrolysis of discarded bakelite and blended bakelite with PP/HDPE is carried out at 450°C. The chemical composition analysis of pyrolytic oils is performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, with comprehensive compound analysis conducted using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). Isothermal thermogravimetry at temperatures ranging from 300°C to 500°C reveals increased thermal degradation with rising pyrolytic temperatures, reaching maximum weight losses of 55 % for bakelite, 82.74 % for PP-bakelite blends, and 90.8 % for HDPE-bakelite blends at 500°C. The isothermal kinetics study reveals that bakelite degrades via D1-diffusion, polypropylene-blended bakelite via A2-Avrami-Erofeyev, and high-density polyethylene-blended bakelite via A3-Avrami-Erofeyev, with activation energies of 17.178, 7.193, and 3.550 kJ/mol, and Arrhenius constants of 0.095, 0.042, and 0.017 min.−1, respectively. The highest condensable yield of 58.76 % during PP-blended bakelite co-pyrolysis underscores its potential for resource recovery. FTIR and GC-MS confirm the presence of alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and oxygenated compounds in the pyrolytic oils, providing detailed insights into their chemical composition. These findings offer critical insights into the thermal degradation behavior and kinetics of bakelite and polypropylene/high-density polyethylene-blended bakelite, highlighting opportunities for efficient waste plastic utilization through pyrolysis for resource recovery and energy generation, and providing essential knowledge for designing isothermal pyrolysis reactors.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics (bakelite, PP, HDPE) with measurable product yields, kinetic analysis, and analytical characterization using GC-MS and FTIR."
"Active learning-based exploration of the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste Research in chemical engineering requires experiments, which are often expensive, time-consuming, and laborious. Design of experiments (DoE) aims to extract maximal information from a minimum number of experiments. The combination of DoE with machine learning leads to the field of active learning, which results in a more flexible, multi-dimensional selection of experiments. Active learning has not yet been applied in reaction modeling, as most active learning techniques still require an excessive amount of data. In this work, a novel active learning framework called GandALF that combines Gaussian processes and clustering is proposed and validated for yield prediction. The performance of GandALF is compared to other active learning strategies in a virtual case study for hydrocracking. Compared to these active learning methods, the novel framework outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves a 33%-reduction in experiments. The proposed active learning approach is the first to also perform well for data-scarce applications, which is demonstrated by selecting experiments to investigate the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste. Both a common DoE-technique, and our methodology selected 18 experiments to study the effect of temperature, space time, and catalyst on the olefin yield for the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE. The experiments selected with active learning were significantly more informative than the regular DoE-technique, proving the applicability of GandALF for reaction modeling and experimental campaigns.","The study involves lab-scale experimental work on the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE, with measurable outcomes including olefin yield, temperature, space time, and catalyst effects."
"Towards waste refinery: Co-feeding HDPE pyrolysis waxes with VGO into the catalytic cracking unit The co-feeding of high-density polyethylene pyrolysis waxes (HDPE waxes) with vacuum gasoil (VGO) on the catalytic cracking has been investigated. Runs have been conducted by feeding a blend of HDPE waxes/VGO (1/4 in mass) to a laboratory-scale reactor that mimics the behavior of the riser reactor of the industrial FCC unit. Tested operating conditions have been the following: 500–560 °C; catalyst to oil mass ratio (C/O), 3–7 gcat gfeed −1; and, contact time, 6 s. The comparison of obtained results, i.e., yield and composition of the fractions, in the cracking of the blend with those obtained in the cracking of the VGO and HDPE waxes separately, has exposed the existence of synergetic mechanisms. This way, the cracking of the blend produces a more olefinic gaseous fraction and a naphtha with higher content of iso-paraffins and olefins and lower of aromatics, together with a comparable yield of coke.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic, with measurable yields and product composition analysis under defined reactor conditions."
"Chemical recycling of complex reject streams from the paper industry via thermal and catalytic pyrolysis Paper-based packaging is a complex multi-material composed of paper (fibers), plastics, and metals, making efficient material recycling complicated. Currently, most of the fibers are recycled into new paper products while the residual material is commonly incinerated. Therefore, to improve the circularity and reduce the fossil dependency chemical recycling is needed. In this study, recycling of the residual materials was evaluated by thermal and catalytic pyrolysis. First, screening tests were performed using five reject materials and four catalysts in an analytical scale and then, a selection of catalyst and reject materials were evaluated in lab-scale followed by a techno-economic assessment. Experimental results indicated that the conversion was more efficient if the reject had high content of plastics compared to fibers, leading to products with increased heating value, higher hydrocarbon yield and less reactive oxygenates compared to the rejects with low plastic ratio. In the thermal pyrolysis 54 % of the weight of the feedstock and 70 wt% of the carbon in the feedstock ended up in a solid organic product (wax) which contained hydrocarbons and alcohols. In the analytical catalytic pyrolysis, HZSM-5 gave the best result in terms of cracking, deoxygenation, and aromatization. Ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis using HZSM-5 resulted in an improved quality of organic liquid with reduced hydrocarbon length as well as deoxygenated and aromatic compounds. The yield of the organic liquid was up to 19 wt% and contained mainly monoaromatics. The techno-economic evaluation showed, for processing 100,000 tons year−1 residual material, the total plant investment and the annual profit are about 29 and 12 million Euros, respectively, if no incentive for treating the residual material.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste from paper industry reject streams, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and catalyst performance evaluation."
"Maximising naphtha-range hydrocarbons from thermal pyrolysis of polyolefin-rich mixed plastic waste by split-plot response surface methodology The pyrolysis of polyolefin (PO)-rich mixed plastic waste represents a promising pathway for recycling plastic waste into liquid hydrocarbons, particularly in the naphtha range, for use as a refinery input. However, assessments of naphtha production from complex plastic waste remain limited. This work systematically investigates the batch pyrolysis of a PO-rich mixed plastic waste derived from a sorted household waste stream (DKR-350) using Design of Experiments (DoE) and response surface methodology (RSM). Oil yield, naphtha-range hydrocarbon yield, and other responses were modelled as functions of relevant processing parameters, such as batch time, temperature, and plastic pre-treatment method. Experiments were conducted in a batch autoclave under various process conditions (380–450 °C, 0–4 h, with varying feedstock pre-treatments, gas types, and pressures). Time and temperature were the most critical factors for achieving the highest oil yield (73% at 420 °C and a batch time of 2.6 h). The highest naphtha yield in the experimental design range was 42% (448 °C, 3.1 h), achieved using a feedstock that had been pre-treated by dry-washing. Additionally, this work gives key insights into the pyrolysis mechanism of plastic waste. For instance, the formation of CO and CO2 was linked to the presence of specific biogenic and non-polyolefinic impurities at various stages during pyrolysis. The composition of the naphtha fraction also becomes increasingly richer in C5-C9 as pyrolysis severity increases. This work explores the potential of pyrolysis as part of the solution to global plastic waste challenges within a more circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of polyolefin-rich mixed plastic waste with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization of naphtha-range hydrocarbons."
"Understanding of synergy in non-isothermal microwave-assisted in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of rice husk and polystyrene waste mixtures Rice husk (RH) and polystyrene (PS) wastes were converted into value-added products using microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis. The graphite susceptor (10 g) along with KOH catalyst (5 g) was mixed with the feedstock to understand the products and energy consumption. RH promoted the char yield (20–34 wt%) and gaseous yields (16–25 wt%) whereas PS enhanced the oil yield (23–70 wt%). Co-pyrolysis synergy induced an increase in gaseous yields (14–53 wt%) due to excessive cracking. The specific microwave energy consumption dramatically decreased in co-pyrolysis (5–22 kJ/g) compared to pyrolysis (56–102 kJ/g). The pyrolysis index increased (17–445) with the increase in feedstock quantity (5–50 g). The obtained oil was composed of monoaromatics (74%) and polyaromatics (18%). The char was rich in carbon content (79.5 wt%) and the gases were composed of CO (24%), H2 (12%), and CH4 (22%).","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastics (polystyrene) and biomass (rice husk), with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Thermal degradation of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) containing flame retardants using a fluidized bed reactor: The effects of Ca-based additives on halogen removal In this study, the thermal degradation of a waste fraction of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene containing brominated flame retardants was performed to reduce halogen content in the pyrolysis oil. Thermal degradation was completed using Ca-based additives (calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide and oyster shells) in a bench-scale pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor and char separation system. Pyrolysis was carried out in a temperature range of 430–510°C. In the absence of any additive, the oil yield amounted to about 77wt.%. With the additives, the oil yield was markedly reduced to within a range of 45–64wt.%. The principle compounds in the oils were toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, cumene, α-methylstyrene, phenol and heteroatom-containing compounds. When Ca(OH)2 was applied, total bromine and chlorine contents in the oil decreased to 0.05 and 0.04wt.%, respectively. In addition, Ca(OH)2 reduced the antimony content in the oil to below 0.001ppm. Most of the halogens and antimony in the feed material were present in the char obtained after pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste ABS plastic with measurable yields, catalyst effects, and product composition analysis using a fluidized bed reactor."
"Upgrading vacuum residue in a supercritical CO2 environment with polypropylene and steam: Insights into products distribution and characterization of liquid products The pyrolysis of vacuum residue (VR) using polypropylene (PP) under supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) conditions represents a novel approach to converting this abundant and difficult-to-process feedstock into lighter liquid products. In this paper, a set of experiments was performed to analyze the impact of scCO2, PP and steam on the yields of pyrolysis products (i.e., liquid, gas and coke) and characteristics of the liquid fractions. The findings indicated notable improvements when scCO2 was used instead of subcritical CO2 in the pyrolysis of VR with PP. These included decreased viscosity and improved API gravity, alongside increased maltene yield and reduced coke yield. Furthermore, the inclusion of PP markedly elevated the quality of the obtained liquid, whereas steam + scCO2 primarily affected the product distribution by raising the yield of coke and gas fractions. VR pyrolysis under scCO2 conditions at 380 °C, 8 MPa, PP/VR ratio of 0.23 for 60 min in a batch system, without the use of catalyst, resulted in the highest liquid yield of 83.7 ± 1.9 wt%, and minimum coke yield of 9.8 ± 1.3 wt%. Under these conditions, the upgraded liquid consisted of 75.2 wt% light and middle distillates with boiling points below 350 °C. Additionally, the proportion of oxygenates in the pyrolysis oil reduced by 60.5 %, improving its heating value. Moreover, adding PP to the upgrading process resulted in a higher proportion of isoparaffins, cycloparaffins, and aromatics, coupled with a decrease in olefins, aligning the liquid specifications more closely with fuel standards.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (polypropylene) with vacuum residue under controlled conditions, reporting measurable product yields, compositional analysis, and reactor parameters."
"Catalytic degradation of linear low-density polyethylene over HY-zeolite via pre-degradation method The catalytic degradation of linear low-density (lldPE) polyethylene over HY-zeolite catalyst was studied in a semi-batch reactor. One of the important problems encountered during catalytic pyrolysis of macromolecules is the contact with the catalyst, which is known to affect the product distribution and the quality of the coke formed. A pre-degradation procedure was introduced to achieve efficient contact between the LLDPE macromolecules and the catalyst. The influence of the pre-degradation to the reaction conditions including holding time, temperature, polymer to catalyst ratio and flow rate of carrier gas was examined. Moreover, the pre-degradation results were compared with the results obtained using normal mixing procedure. The results obtained showed that, pre-degradation promotes the liquid fraction by a factor of more than one-fold increase at the expense of the gas fraction and the coke yield. The optimal liquid fraction with pre-degradation was obtained at low reaction temperature and catalyst amount respectively, i.e. high polymer to catalyst ratio, making it economically viable method for the degradation of lldPE. The coke content was analysed using TGA in nitrogen atmosphere to remove the soft coke and then in air isothermally at the final temperature to burn the hard coke. The TGA results of the coked sample show less concentration of coke components on the catalyst using the pre-degradation method as compared to the normal mixing which shows high concentration of coke components especially at low reaction temperature. Moreover, the majority of the coke components produced using the pre-degradation method were soft coke, making it more efficient for the re-usability of the catalyst. The liquid samples collected were analysed using gas chromatography and the products distribution were presented in the form of boiling point distribution curves. The bulk of the liquid products produced were lighter fractions with a peak around the gasoline range.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization including GC analysis and TGA."
"Study of the gases obtained in thermal and catalytic flash pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor A fluidized bed reactor was used to study the production of gases from the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The effect of the bed temperature and type of catalyst was evaluated. The range of operating temperature was from 400 to 800°C. The catalysts used in this study were HZSM-5 and HUSY in a proportion of 20% by weight. The analysis of the volatile compounds showed that the main products obtained with both catalysts were similar, but the amount of gases produced with HZSM-5 was higher than the amount obtained with HUSY. The major compounds obtained with both catalysts were C3 and C4 hydrocarbons (propane, propene, trans-butene, 1-butene, isobutene and cis-2-butene) and C5 olefins (1-pentene).","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE in a fluidized bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, catalyst performance, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Microwave-assisted in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene: Analysis of product formation and energy consumption using machine learning approach Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis is a prominent technology for the production of high-quality fuel intermediates and value-added chemicals from polystyrene waste. The objectives of this study were to understand the role of catalyst (KOH) on polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis. Pyrolysis experiments were conducted using a microwave oven at a power of 450 W and a temperature of 600 °C. Graphite susceptor (10 g) was used to achieve the required pyrolysis conditions. In addition, the design of experiments (DoE) with machine learning (ML) was used to understand the loading of PS (5 g, 27.5 g, and 50 g), and KOH (5 g, 7.5 g, and 10 g). The products including oil, gas, and char were collected in every experiment. The average heating rates achieved were in the range of 30–50 °C/min. The specific microwave power (microwave power per unit mass of feedstock) decreased with an increase in PS amount from 90 to 9 W/g. However, the specific microwave energy (microwave energy per unit mass of feedstock) (27–73 kJ/g) was in line with the average heating rate. The maximum yield of pyrolysis oil was found to be 95 wt%, which was obtained with a PS:KOH ratio of 27.5 g: 7.5 g. The oil yield increased from 80 to 95 wt% when the mass of the catalyst increased from 5 to 7.5 g. On the other hand, the gas yield (3–18 wt%) varied significantly and char yield (1–2 wt%) was not influenced. The yields predicted by ML matched well with the experimental yields. This study demonstrated the potential of KOH as a catalyst for PS pyrolysis technology as the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the oil fraction was significantly promoted.","The study involves microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste, with measured product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization, satisfying all mandatory criteria."
"Microwave co-pyrolysis for simultaneous disposal of environmentally hazardous hospital plastic waste, lignocellulosic, and triglyceride biowaste Microwave co-pyrolysis was examined as an approach for simultaneous reduction and treatment of environmentally hazardous hospital plastic waste (HPW), lignocellulosic (palm kernel shell, PKS) and triglycerides (waste vegetable oil, WVO) biowaste as co-feedstock. The co-pyrolysis demonstrated faster heating rate (16–43 °C/min) compared to microwave pyrolysis of single feedstock (9–17 °C/min). Microwave co-pyrolysis of HPW/WVO performed at 1:1 ratio produced a higher yield (80.5 wt%) of hydrocarbon liquid fuel compared to HPW/PKS (78.2 wt%). The liquid oil possessed a low nitrogen content (< 4 wt%) and free of sulfur that could reduce the release of hazardous pollutants during its use as fuel in combustion. In particular, the liquid oil obtained from co-pyrolysis of HPW/WVO has low oxygenated compounds (< 16%) leading to reduction in generation of potentially hazardous sludge or problematic acidic tar during oil storage. Insignificant amount of benzene derivatives (< 1%) was also found in the liquid oil, indicating the desirable feature of this pyrolysis approach to suppress the formation of toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Microwave co-pyrolysis of HPW/WVO improved the yield and properties of liquid oil for potential use as a cleaner fuel, whereas the liquid oil from co-pyrolysis of HPW/PKS is applicable in the synthesis of phenolic resin.","The study involves microwave co-pyrolysis of waste plastic (hospital plastic waste) with biowaste, demonstrating measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and fuel quality analysis."
"Catalytical thermal conversion of waste fishing nets for a higher added value energy products generation and caprolactam recovery The ongoing eutrophication processes and water pollution caused by marine plastic waste are relevant ecological problem. Collected wastes are possible alternative feedstock for additional higher added value energy product generation. Moreover, caprolactamis the main compound of nylon-6 waste fishing nets and its recovery conserves natural resources, maximizes waste economic performance, and closes the circular economy loop of the fishing net industry. In order to contribute to the creation of circular economy, investigation of pyrolysis process and the effect of catalyst synergy with different temperatures on the formulated products has been performed. This work aims to analyse the used fishing nets (FN), using TGA-DTG-FTIR systems and mini pyrolysis plant. Experiments were conducted with Y-type zeolite and ZSM-5 as catalysts with a ratio of 1 by 3 and 1 by 8, respectively. Micro-thermal analysis using the TGA-DTG-FTIR system was processed for feedstock characterization purposes, which showed that the fishing gear has one minor decomposition peak around 200 °C, and the major one around 450 °C, with a total weight loss of 88 wt%. Pyro-oils analysis showed that the main fractions could be assigned to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as naphthalene, styrene, and toluene. Moreover, the recovery of caprolactam shows a possibility to obtain not only energy products, but also higher added value chemical derivatives. Temperature and catalyst synergetic approach influence for the recovered products investigation showed the optimum conditions as 700 °C for the highest purity and quality products generation. Based on the results, catalytic thermal treatment at 700 °C with Y-Type could be adapted as a promising technique for extracting of caprolactam with a high yield (96 %).","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste fishing nets (a plastic waste feedstock) using Y-type zeolite and ZSM-5 catalysts, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and product composition analysis via GC–MS and FTIR."
"Lab-scale thermal analysis of electronic waste plastics In this work, we experimentally revealed the thermochemical decomposition pathway of Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) containing electronic waste plastics using an online thermogravimetric–fourier transform infrared–mass spectroscopy (TG–FTIR–MS) system, a high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass (HRGC–MS) spectroscopy, and a fixed-bed reactor. We found the distribution and species of produced bromides can be easily controlled by adjusting pyrolytic temperature, which is particularly crucial to their recycle. From the analysis of the liquid and solid phase obtained from the fixed-bed reactor, we proposed that the Br radicals formed during the pyrolysis process may be captured by organic species derived from the depolymerization of plastics to form brominated compounds or by the inorganic species in the plastics, and that these species remained in the char residue after pyrolysis. Our work for the first time demonstrates intramolecular oxygen atoms play a pivotal role in the formation of PBDD/Fs that pyrolysis of oxygen-free BFRs is PBDD/Fs-free, whereas pyrolysis of oxygen-containing BFRs is PBDD/Fs-reduced.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of electronic waste plastics using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product analysis and temperature-dependent bromide distribution, demonstrating experimental data on pyrolysis products and mechanisms."
"The chlorine migration routes and transformation mechanism during the co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride and low-rank coal In the thermal conversion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and carbon-containing resources, chlorine has seriously harmed environmental safety, human health and chemical equipment. However, present studies do not have a consistent understanding on the relationship between chlorine release, chlorine distribution and changes in chlorine morphology. In this work, the chlorine migration characteristics during the co-pyrolysis of PVC and low-rank coals were studied by fixed bed pyrolysis experiment, thermogravimetric-mass spectrometer (TG-MS) and in situ pyrolysis time of flight mass spectrometry (Py-TOF-MS), and the distribution and release behavior of chlorine in each product was investigated by changing the pyrolysis temperatures, mixing ratios and coal types. The results showed that the co-pyrolysis process inhibited the release of HCl and chlorine migrated from HCl to char and co-pyrolysis water during the co-pyrolysis process. The co-pyrolysis water influenced the release and migration of chlorine in different aspects. At the later stage (around 410–550 °C) of co-pyrolysis, the relatively stable Car-Cl bond broke and formed HCl. In addition, the chlorine fixing capacity of minerals in low-rank coals was depended on the species and quantity of minerals that react with HCl directly, and their chlorine fixing capacity reached the upper limit when the mixing ratio was 8:2. Variations of other compounds (containing N, S) also affected the chlorination reactions. The relationship between chlorine distribution, chlorine release, chlorine transformation, and external conditions during co-pyrolysis was established and the targeted regulation of chlorine was proposed based on the above conclusions. Hence the migration mechanism of chlorine provided guidance for the clean and efficient utilization of waste plastics and low-rank coal and the regulation of chlorine.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of waste plastic (PVC) with low-rank coal, includes measurable product yields, temperature-dependent chlorine distribution, and analytical characterization such as TG-MS and Py-TOF-MS."
"Influence of catalyst acidity of spent FCC catalyst and TiO2 on product distribution in microwave assisted LDPE cracking This study investigated microwave-assisted cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) utilizing in-situ spent FCC and TiO2 as catalysts and graphite powder as an absorber to reduce carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Olefins, paraffins, and aromatics were major products of liquid fractions, whereas gaseous fraction primarily composed of propylene, propane, butene, and pentene. Obtained results indicated that optimal pyrolysis temperatures were 450 °C and 500 °C, respectively for spent FCC and TiO2. At optimized reaction conditions around 90 wt % gaseous products achieved which contain 67 % propylene with FCC, and 33 % propylene and 25 % butene with TiO2. In presence of spent FCC, paraffins, olefins, and aromatics were main liquid products, while TiO2 primarily produced paraffins and olefins as key products. Liquid products range from C8 to C30, making them appropriate for gasoline and diesel components.","The study involves microwave-assisted pyrolysis of LDPE waste plastic with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"A study on biofuel produced from cracking of low density poly ethylenes using TiO2/AlSBA-15 nanocatalysts The burgeoning concerns over the non-biodegradable plastics wastes could be surpassed either by proper disposal technique or by an effective conversion of the plastic wastes into useful chemicals. Metal oxide; TiO2 and porous; AlSBA-15 catalysts were synthesized and a composite characterized using XRD, BET, N2 adsorption –desorption studies, TPD and SEM techniques. This work was focussed in the catalytic degradation of low density polyethylene over the synthesized catalysts in a fixed bed reactor. A hydrocarbon rich gasoline range of liquid fuel, coke and gas were the expected products from the experiment. The liquid products were analysed using GC MS equipped with J&W Scientific DB-Petro capillary column (100 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 m). An optimum yield of liquid fuel was obtained with TiO2 catalyst at 1st h of reaction and further the product yield considerably decreased. A marginal increase in % conversion of low density polyethylene into fuel was observed with increasing catalyst: polymer ratio in the presence of TiO2 catalyst till 1:5 ratio. The liquid products contained lower range of hydrocarbons with higher content of active catalyst; while the samples collected at later stage contained heavier components. Mesoporous AlSBA-15 worked comparatively better than TiO2 by converting 89.7% of LDPE into 54.8% combustible liquid products. The catalytic activity of the catalyst followed the order of TiO2/AlSBA-15 (10%) < AlSBA-15 (27) < SiSBA-15 < TiO2. A considerable increase in gasoline fraction from 45.6% to 85.4%, yield of liquid fuel (89.1%) and conversion (98.4%) was observed during cracking in the presence of TiO2/AlSBA-15 catalyst. Plastic liquid fuel produced over the composite catalyst revealed the calorific value of 47.8 MJ/Kg which was higher than the commercial petroleum fuel. Finally, we obtain this biofuel application as mathematical model to evaluate and plot the interaction energy arising from the conjugation of TiO2 - AlSBA-15 nano-catalyst in two possible configuration, linear (conical) and spherical molecules, along the range of the α distance ( z - a x i s ) .","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in a fixed-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and detailed analytical characterization including GC–MS, XRD, BET, and SEM."
"Alkaline reforming of brominated fire-retardant plastics: Fate of bromine and antimony High-impact polystyrene (HIPS) flame retarded with decabromodiphenyl ether (DDE), has been reacted in supercritical water from 380 to 450°C and 21.5 to 31.0MPa pressure in a batch reactor. Different concentrations of sodium hydroxide additive were used in situ to neutralize the corrosive inorganic bromine species released during the reactions. It appeared that supercritical water conditions lowered the decomposition temperature of both the fire-retardant DDE and HIPS. The reaction products included oils (up to 76wt%), char (up to 18wt%) and gas (up to 2.4wt%) which was mainly methane. The presence of the alkaline water led to up to 97wt% debromination of the product oil, producing virtually bromine-free oil feedstock. The removal of antimony from the oil product during processing was of the order of 98wt%. The oil consisted of many single- and multiple-ringed aromatic compounds, many of which had alkyl substituents and/or aliphatic C n -bridges (n =1–4). The major single-ringed compounds included toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene and α-methylstyrene. Bibenzyl (diphenylethane), stilbene, diphenylmethane, diphenylpropane, diphenylcyclopropane, diphenylpropene, diphenylbutane, diphenylbutene and diphenylbuta-1,3-diene were the major C n -bridged compounds. Diphenyl ether and acetophenone were the major oxygenated compounds found. The process thus has the potential to produce bromine-free and antimony-free oils from fire-retardant plastics.","The study involves lab-scale supercritical water treatment of brominated high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), a waste plastic, with measurable product yields, catalyst-free debromination, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Catalytic Pyrolysis of Polystyrene over Steel Slag under CO2 Environment As the consumption of plastic materials has been dramatically increased, the abundant presence of their debris has become a significant problem worldwide. Thus, this study proposes a sustainable plastic conversion platform for energy recovery. In detail, polystyrene pyrolysis was examined as a case study under CO2 atmosphere in reference to N2 condition. The major gaseous and liquid products from polystyrene pyrolysis include permanent gases (syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons) and condensable aromatic compounds. Under CO2 environment, the reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was achieved during polystyrene pyrolysis, in comparison with N2 condition. Since its slow reaction kinetics, conversion of condensable hydrocarbons into permanent gases was not fully activated. Therefore, a cheap industrial waste, steel slag (SS), was employed as a catalyst to increase reaction kinetics. The synergistic effects of SS and CO2 contributed to doubling H2 production, while CO formation increased more than 300 times, in reference to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Because CO2 acted as an oxidant for CO production, control of H2/CO ratio was achieved in different conditions. Thus, the utilization of CO2 would suggest a promising way to reduce the formation of PAHs, adopting the reliable platform to produce syngas from plastic waste.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene (a commercial plastic) using steel slag as a catalyst under CO2, with measurable product yields and compositional analysis of syngas and aromatic compounds."
"Pressurized pyrolysis of mattress residue: An alternative to landfill management Mattresses are a difficult waste to manage in landfills due to their large volume and low density. Pyrolysis treatment could reduce its volume while producing fuel or products valuable for the chemical industry. Pressurized pyrolysis at 400, 450, and 500 °C is carried out in a lab-scale autoclave at initial pressures 4.2, 8.4, and 16.8 bar. Product gas yield increases slightly along with elevated pressure as well as temperature. However, beyond 8.4 bar the initial pressure makes no discernible differences. CO and CO2 are the major gas species followed by CH4. CO contributes the most to the product gas energy content followed by C3 species, C2H6, and H2. Calculated energy content (heating value) is between 2 and 15 MJ·Nm−3. In terms of product gas energy content, low pressure pyrolysis is favorable over high pressure pyrolysis. According to integration areas of chromatographic measurements the liquid phase contains up to 25 % of N-compounds, with benzonitrile being the most abundant, followed by toluene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene. The solid char maintains constant properties across operating conditions, with carbon and energy contents of approximately 75 wt% and 30 MJ·kg−1, respectively.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste mattress residue (a plastic-containing waste) with measurable product yields, reactor conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Thermochemical conversion of polymer wastes into hydrocarbon fuels over various fluidizing cracking catalysts A mixture of hospital post-commercial polymer waste (LDPE/HDPE/PP/PS) was pyrolyzed over various catalysts using a fluidized-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons with zeolitic catalysts (ZSM-5>MOR>USY) were higher than with non-zeolitic catalysts (MCM-41>ASA). MCM-41 with large mesopores and ASA with weaker acid sites resulted in a highly olefinic product mixture with a wide carbon number distribution, whereas USY yielded a saturate–rich product mixture with a wide carbon number distribution and substantial coke levels. The systematic experiments discussed in this paper show that the use of various catalysts improves the yield of hydrocarbon products and provide better selectivity in the product distributions. A novel developed model based on kinetic and mechanistic considerations which take into account chemical reactions and catalyst deactivation for the catalytic degradation of commingled polymer waste has been investigated. This model represents the benefits of product selectivity for the chemical composition such as alkanes, alkenes, aromatics and coke in relation to the performance and the particle size selection of the catalyst used as well as the effect of the fluidizing gas and reaction temperature.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (LDPE/HDPE/PP/PS) in a fluidized-bed reactor with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Thermal conversion of polyolefins/polystyrene ternary mixtures: Kinetics and pyrolysis on a laboratory and commercial scales The thermal treatment of the three-component mixtures of polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene has been investigated. Thermal reactions have been described and the kinetics of thermal decomposition using the Friedmańs differential isoconversional method have been evaluated; slow pyrolysis on a laboratory scale and the pyrolysis of a contaminated waste mixture on a commercial scale have been carried out. The obtained results show that polystyrene radicals promote the decomposition of polyolefins, as a result of which the thermal decomposition of polyethylene and polypropylene proceeds faster and the yields of the gas and oil obtained during pyrolysis are quite high: 4–6wt.% of gas and 88–90wt.% of oil in the case of laboratory-scale pyrolysis and 15wt.% of gas and losses and 80wt.% of oil in the case of commercial-scale pyrolysis. TG-FTIR and TG-MS analyses have proved that the composition of volatile pyrolysis products varies. In the case of the ternary mixture with prevailing polyethylene (and polypropylene and polystyrene being in minority), the volatiles contained mainly aliphatic hydrocarbons and substituted benzenes; in the case of the ternary mixture with prevailing polypropylene, a significantly higher amount of substituted alicyclic compounds was found. This was confirmed by the GC–MS analysis of the oils obtained. Considering the quite high HHV and LHV of oils (46–48MJ/kg and 43–45MJ/kg, resp., in the case of laboratory-scale pyrolysis and 43 and 41MJ/kg, resp., in the case of commercial-scale pyrolysis) as well as the very low content of sulfur and nitrogen, the oils can be used as a clean liquid fuel; because of their composition, they can also serve as a source of chemicals and solvents.","The study involves laboratory-scale pyrolysis of polyolefins and polystyrene mixtures, with measured yields, product composition analysis via GC–MS, and characterization using TG-FTIR and TG-MS."
"Catalytic degradation of waste high-density polyethylene into fuel products using BaCO3 as a catalyst Waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was degraded thermally and catalytically using BaCO3 as a catalyst under different conditions of temperature, cat/pol ratio and time. The oil collected at optimum conditions (450°C, 0.1 cat/pol ratio and 2h reaction time) was fractionated at different temperatures and fuel property of the fractions and parent oil was evaluated by their physicochemical parameters for fuel tests. The results were compared with the standard values for gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil. Boiling point distribution (BPD) curves were plotted from the gas chromatographic study of the samples and compared with that of the standard gasoline, kerosene and diesel. The oil samples were analyzed using GC/MS in order to find out their composition. The physical parameters and the composition of the parent oil and its fractions support the resemblance of the samples with the standard fuel oils. The light fractions best match with gasoline, the middle fractions match with kerosene and the heavier fractions match with diesel oil in almost all of the characteristic properties.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste HDPE, a commercial plastic, with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and fuel property evaluation under defined experimental conditions."
"Co-hydropyrolysis of pine and HDPE over bimetallic catalysts: Efficient BTEX production and process mechanism analysis Co-pyrolysis of plastics and biomass is expected to replace traditional petroleum processing to produce BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) on a large scale, which are important chemical raw materials. The introduction of bimetallic catalysts and hydrogen in co-pyrolysis systems is an effective strategy to increase the content of aromatic hydrocarbons in pyrolysis oils, which has not been studied so far. The present study investigated the efficacy of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing aromatization and Diels-Alder reactions in comparison to Mo/ZSM-5. The synergistic interaction between bimetals contributed to the improved selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly BTEX. Results revealed that NiMo/ZSM-5 catalysts led to higher aromatics selectivity in liquid oil, whereas FeMo/ZSM-5 resulted in higher BTEX selectivity in aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, metal oxide-supported bimetallic catalysts exhibited lower selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid oil, despite facilitating higher liquid-oil yield. Among the metal oxide-supported bimetallic catalysts, FeMo/TiO2 demonstrated the highest selectivity (56%) for aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid oils. The introduction of hydrogen resulted in 100% selectivity of BTEX in aromatic hydrocarbons, thus highlighting the significance of hydrogenation in enhancing the selectivity of BTEX. Combined with the experimental results and literature, a possible reaction mechanism was also proposed.","The study involves lab-scale co-pyrolysis of HDPE (a waste plastic) and pine (biomass) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and BTEX selectivity analysis using experimental methods."
"Catalytic co-pyrolysis of Vachellia Farnesiana with polypropylene plastic to produce bio-oil: Parameter optimization study Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass Vachellia Farnesiana (VF) and Polyropylene (PP) plastic was carried out using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) catalyst to produce high quality oil. A semi batch pyrolysis reactor was used to perform the co-pyrolysis of VF and PP at different temperatures (350–550 °C), time (20-60mins), VF/PP ratio (0–100 %) and catalyst loading (0–10 %). The experiments were conducted using 40 g feed mixture to optimize the feed ratio, temperature, reaction time, and Na2CO3 catalyst ratio. The best conditions for the process were thus found to be 450 °C temperature, 40 min time, and 5 wt% Na2CO3 catalyst. Under these conditions, the maximum fuel oil yield of ∼ 64 % was achieved, which was approximately 4 % higher than oil yield obtained without utilization of Na2CO3 catalyst. Variations in temperature, the VF/PP ratio, and the Na2CO3 catalyst parameters had the most significant effects on improving the quality of the oil. The utilization of Na2CO3, along with an increase in temperature and the amount of PP in the VF/PP blend, contributed to higher yields and a greater gross calorific value (GCV) of the obtained oil. FTIR analysis was conducted to identify the functional groups present in the oil. Similarly, GCMS analysis further revealed that the presence of a significant alkanes and alkenes, along with fewer oxygenates, was responsible for the favorable GCV of the oil. The addition of the Na2CO3 catalyst was found to increase the concentrations of alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols, while reducing acids, ethers, and ketones. As a result, it was able to enhance the quality of the oil.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene plastic with biomass, featuring measurable yields, reactor conditions, catalyst performance, and product characterization."
"Conversion of pyrolytic non-condensable gases from polypropylene co-polymer into bamboo-type carbon nanotubes and high-quality oil using biochar as catalyst The conversion of low-value plastic waste into high-value products such as carbon nanomaterial is of recent interest. In the current study, the non-condensable pyrolysis gases, produced from Polypropylene Copolymer (PPC) feedstock, was converted into bamboo-type carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) through catalytic chemical vapour deposition using biochar. Experiments were conducted in a three-zone furnace fixed bed reactor, where PPC was pyrolysed in the second zone and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) growth was eventuated in the third zone. The effects of different growth temperatures (500, 700, 900 °C) and biochar particle sizes (nanoparticle as well as 0–100 and 100–300 μm) were investigated to optimise the production of hydrogen and the yield of carbon nanotubes on the biochar surface. Biochar samples used in the synthesis of CNTs were obtained from the pyrolysis of saw dust at 700 °C in a muffle furnace. Analyses performed by using Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy techniques suggested that the best crystalline structure of CNTs were obtained at 900 °C with nano-sized biochar as a catalyst. The strong gas-solid contact and void fraction of nano-sized particles enhances the diffusion–precipitation mechanism, leading to the growth of CNTs. The nano-sized biochar increased hydrogen production at 900 °C and reduced the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content in oil to only 1%, which is advantageous for further utilisation. Therefore, the production of high-value CNTs from waste plastic using low-cost biochar catalyst can be a sustainable approach in the management of waste plastic while participating in the circular economy.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of polypropylene copolymer waste in a fixed-bed reactor, with measurable yields, catalyst performance, and product characterization including oil composition and CNT formation."
"Valorisation of tyre waste from a vulcanisation plant by catalytic pyrolysis – Experimental investigations using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor This study focuses on the use of car tyre waste collected at a tyre repair station in Krakow (Poland). Waste from damaged tyres is disposed of as municipal solid waste. Therefore, the management of waste tyres already shredded by pyrolysis at 500 °C has been proposed. Tyre waste was hypothesised to be converted into valuable chemical products by pyrolysis in a hybrid reactor (drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor). On a micro scale, pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to analyse the pyrolysis process. It has been shown that the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during pyrolysis clearly depends on whether the catalyst and tyre waste are mixed together or arranged in layers. Since the layered arrangement favoured the formation of hydrocarbons, such a system was used in the drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor. The high heating rate (500 °C/s) of tyre particles in the drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C allowed for the obtained a raw carbon black yield of 40.8 %. A similar yield of raw carbon black determined by thermogravimetric analysis for a heating rate of 0.17 °C/s) was observed at 800 °C. However, before commercial use, raw carbon black requires demineralisation because of its high ash content (approximately 50 %). The raw carbon black ash contained up to 90 % SiO2, indicating that it could be a valuable catalyst material. Pyrolysis of tyre waste over the catalyst reduced the oxygen content in the oil and yield. The oil yields of tyre pyrolysis without a catalyst and over zeolite Y were 38 wt% and 35 wt%, respectively. The main components identified in the tyre pyrolysis gas were methane (27.6%), ethene (28.8%), and hydrogen (15.6%). The gas from catalytic pyrolysis was richer in CO and CO2.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste tyres, a type of plastic waste, using a fixed-bed reactor with measurable yields, product composition analysis, and experimental characterization."
"Chemical recycling of plastic waste to monomers: Effect of catalyst contact time, acidity and pore size on olefin recovery in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin waste The catalytic upgrading of post-consumer mixed polyolefinic waste pyrolysis vapors has been studied over five different solid acid catalysts to understand the effect of vapor-catalyst contact time and catalyst properties on the recovery of light olefins (C2-C4). HZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 11 and 27 produced the highest light olefins yields (83.4 wt% and 72.1 wt%, respectively) at a very short contact time of ∼5 ms while extending the contact time (≥23 ms) decreased the olefin yields and resulted in higher yields of aromatics (∼30.0 wt% and ∼40.0 wt%, respectively). Short contact time (5 ms) was not sufficient for HZSM-22 to crack pyrolysis vapors to C2-C4 olefins (8.0 wt%) but increasing contact time improved C2-C4 yields to 53.5 wt% without increased production of aromatics, which may be attributed to its small pore size (shape selectivity). SAPO-34, SAPO-11, and Al-MCM-41 were not selective to light olefins at any studied contact time.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed polyolefinic waste with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and temperature–yield relationships."
"Investigation on the low-temperature pyrolysis of automotive shredder residue (ASR) for energy recovery and metal recycling The automotive shredder residue (ASR) or shredder light fraction (SLF) is the remaining fraction from the metal recovery of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). While processes for metal recovery from ELVs are well developed, the similar process for ASR remains a challenge. In this work, low-temperature pyrolysis of the ASR fraction was investigated under the assumption that a low temperature and inert environment would enhance the metal recovery, i.e. the metals would not be further oxidised from their original state and the organic material could be separated from the metals in the form of volatiles and char. Pyrolysis experiments were performed in a tube reactor operating at 300, 400 and 500 °C. The gas and oil obtained by pyrolysis were analysed by micro-GC (micro-Gas Chromatography) and GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry), respectively. It was found that the gas produced contained a high amount of CO2, limiting the energy recovery from this fraction. The oil consisted of a high concentration of phenolic and aromatic compounds. The solid residue was crushed and fractionated into different particle sizes for further characterization. The pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C was found to be insufficient for metal liberation, while the char was easier to crush at tested temperature of 400 and 500 °C. The intermediate temperature of 400 °C is then suggested for the process to keep the energy consumption low.","The study involves lab-scale low-temperature pyrolysis of automotive shredder residue (ASR), a waste plastic mixture, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of oil and gas via GC/MS and micro-GC."
"Possible use of spent FCC catalyst for upgrading of wax from the pyrolysis of plastics to liquid fuel The cracking of heavy wax derived from mixed plastics (high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene) to chemical and fuel purposes was explored using spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (spent FCC). The wax cracking was performed by a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor with a slow heating rate. All catalysts, when compared to other catalysts (HY zeolite and MCM-41), could enhance liquid oil and gas production. While the spent FCC catalyst produced the highest liquid oil with least amount of coke production. The influence of spent FCC catalyst ratio on product distribution revealed that a catalyst-wax ratio of up to 1:1 resulted in a higher liquid oil yield than a low ratio. Additionally, the increase of cracking temperature promoted more oil production; however, at high temperature (above 400 °C) the evaporation of wax became more significant, and consequently a high portion of produced wax was obtained. Therefore, under suitable conditions, the spent FCC catalyst demonstrated the possibility of upgrading the heavy wax into liquid fuels and chemicals. In addition, this study also compared the products obtained from two processing routes using the spent FCC catalyst. The first route involved the pyrolysis of plastics into wax and then cracking the wax into liquid fuel, while the second route involved a one-step process that directly converted plastics into liquid fuel. The spent FCC catalyst promoted the production of diesel-range hydrocarbons and suppressed the aromatic production for the wax cracking. By contrast, the spent FCC catalyst significantly enhanced aromatic production during the cracking of mixed plastics.","The study involves lab-scale fixed-bed pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (HDPE, LDPE, PP) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of products."
"Feasibilities of producing high-value carbon nanotubes from waste plastics by spray pyrolysis Producing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from waste plastics could enhance the economic feasibility of the waste management process. Spray pyrolysis is a practical and promising method in this research area. However, the synthesis of CNTs by a spray pyrolysis method is highly reliant on a variety of parameters. Therefore, parameters, including the amount of waste plastics (polypropylene), the catalyst feeding rate and the concentration of the catalyst, and the reaction temperature, were investigated in this work. Results indicate that the reaction factors can influence the carbon deposition and carbon nanotubes yield (CNTs yield). The formed catalyst size played a significant role in the synthesis process. The carbon deposition and CNTs yield reached the top at 21.11 mg g−1 plastic and 11.60 mg g−1 plastic, respectively, when the PP amount is 2.0 g, the feeding rate of catalyst is 9.0 mL h−1, the concentration of catalyst is 0.2 mol L−1, and the reaction temperature is 800 °C in this work.","The study involves lab-scale spray pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (a commercial plastic) with measurable yields of carbon nanotubes and carbon deposition, along with defined reactor conditions and catalyst parameters."
"Sustainable coke-resistant Ca-Al nano-sized catalyst for cogenerating hydrogen and high-value liquid fuels via pyrolysis catalytic steam reforming reaction of the polystyrene-phenol mixture The production of synthetic plastics, particularly polystyrene (PS), has had a significant impact on humanity and has led to an increase in global waste. Since conventional treatment methods cannot effectively recycle these materials, this study aimed to find a solution by valorizing polystyrene waste and phenol through an in-situ pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming reaction utilizing the γ-Al2O3 (Al) and CaO (Ca) nanomaterials for the production of hydrogen and liquid fuel. The catalysts were prepared using impregnation and hydrothermal techniques, and their physicochemical properties were characterized after being calcined and utilized. Among the catalysts used, the 2Ca3Al nanocatalyst had high performance due to its high surface area, uniformly distributed Ca and Al alloy, surface hydroxyl groups, and oxygen vacancies. At 700 oC, the 2Ca3Al nanocatalyst demonstrated a phenol conversion rate and H2 yield of 98.5 % and 92.5 %, respectively. The main compounds detected in the liquid product were tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide (TBH) and Dixanthogen.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste with measurable yields of hydrogen and liquid fuel, including detailed product analysis and catalyst performance data."
"Pyrolysis of the tetra pak This study deals with pyrolysis of tetra pak which is widely used as an aseptic beverage packaging material. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out under inert atmosphere in a batch reactor at different temperatures and by different pyrolysis modes (one- and two-step). The yields of char, liquid and gas were quantified. Pyrolysis liquids produced were collected as three separate phases; aqueous phase, tar and polyethylene wax. Characterization of wax and the determination of the total amount of phenols in aqueous phase were performed. Chemical compositions of gas and char products relevant to fuel applications were determined. Pure aluminum can be also recovered by pyrolysis.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste tetra pak (a mixed plastic waste material) with measured product yields, characterized products, and defined reactor conditions."
"Characterization of liquid fraction obtained from pyrolysis of post-consumer mixed plastic waste: A comparing between measured and calculated parameters In this study, thermal pyrolysis of a real mixture of plastic wastes collected from municipal solid waste of Granada (Spain) was performed to obtain a liquid oil. The goals of the present study were: 1) identify the optimal conditions to obtain maximum yields of the liquid fraction, 2) experimentally measure basic characteristic parameters of pyrolytic oils, 3) use correlations or equations used in the hydrocarbon industry to estimate the measured properties, 4) make a comparison between the measured and calculated properties by predictive mathematical expressions, 5) develop new correlations for estimating pyrolytic oil properties. As main results, the optimal temperature to obtain maximum yield of liquid fraction was 500 °C. The physical and chemical properties of pyrolytic oils changed as temperature increased due to the presence of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Also, the approximation of the chromatography data allowed to determine, by simulated distillation, the potential fuel yields that will be obtained if processed as synthetic crude in an atmospheric tower and a vacuum tower. Finally, two novel modified equations were proposed to estimate the specific gravity and refractive index parameter for pyrolytic oils.","The study involves lab-scale thermal pyrolysis of real post-consumer mixed plastic waste, with measured product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and analytical characterization of the liquid fraction."
"Co-production of light olefins and aromatics with high PX selectivity from catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene over shaped ZSM-5 microspheres White pollution has intensified due to plastics’ inherent degradation resistance. Catalytic pyrolysis can convert waste plastics into valuable chemicals like light olefins and aromatics while reducing pollution. However, insufficient selectivity for target products remains a challenge. In this study, the shaped ZSM-5 (Z5) microspheres from industry was used and modified via 3.0 wt% impregnation of P, Ga, and Zn to enhance the yield of light olefins and aromatics in ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Incorporating P, Ga, or Zn modulated catalyst acidity, promoting the dehydrogenation /aromatization reactions and significantly increasing liquid, light olefin and aromatic yields. The Zn-Z5 microspheres gave the highest light olefin yield (36.7 wt%), and decreased alkane yield by 24.6 wt%, sharply increasing olefin-alkane ratio from 0.52 to 1.56, compared with Z5. Concurrently, the yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and C9 + aromatics in the liquid products were increased, with the yield of aromatics rising from 22.6 wt% (Z5) to 38.4 wt% (Zn-P/Z5). Notably, the p-xylene (PX) selectivity in xylenes significantly improved, with the selectivity of Zn-P/Z5 attaining 75.3 %. These results show that employing P-, Ga-, and Zn-modified Z5 microspheres for the catalytic pyrolysis of plastics facilitates the high-value recycling of waste plastics, achieving co-production of light olefins and aromatics with high PX selectivity.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a waste plastic, with measurable yields of light olefins, aromatics, and p-xylene, along with catalyst modification and product characterization."
"Effect of marine ambient in the production of pollutants from the pyrolysis and combustion of a mixture of plastic materials A mixture of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene-terephtalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and Nylon was submerged in marine water during 12 moths. The chlorine content of these plastics was measured through the passing time. Thermobalance was used to look for differences in the thermal decomposition of the plastics during in that time interval. Degradation of PET, PP and Nylon produced changes in the weight loss curve, but behaviour of PE is confusing. Pyrolysis and combustion at 850 °C was finally performed to get knowledge of the possible differences in the emission of main gases, volatiles and semivolatiles including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated benzenes (ClBzs), polychlorinated phenols (ClPhs), polybrominated phenols (BrPhs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Results show that the emission of chlorinated species is somewhat not affected by the chlorine content of the plastics mix. The production of PCBs and PCDD/Fs was very low, under 4 pg WHO-TEQ/g.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis and combustion of waste plastics (PE, PET, PP, Nylon) with measurable product emissions and analytical characterization of pollutants."
"Utilizing CO2 to suppress the generation of harmful chemicals from thermal degradation of polyvinyl chloride This study put a great emphasis on the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) in thermal decomposition of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). To do this, systematic experimental works were carried out to explore the influence of CO2 on pyrolysis of PVC by comparing with that in N2. First of all, a series of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of PVC in N2 and CO2 was performed to characterize the thermal deconstruction of PVC in N2 and CO2, which confirmed that any physical aspect (i.e., onset and end temperature of depolymerization of PVC) attributed by CO2 was nearly negligible as compared to the case in N2. This phenomenon was also fully evidenced by differential thermogram (DTG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) because both DTG and DSC curves in N2 and CO2 were identical. However, the concentration profiles of CO evolved from the thermal degradation of PVC in N2 and CO2 was significantly different: the enhanced generation of CO occurred in the presence of CO2. This observation suggested that the genuine role of CO2 is to consume carbon source (i.e., acting as a carbon scavenger) for pyrolysis of PVC. It also provided a favorable condition for suppressing the formation of harmful chemical compounds such as benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Therefore, the mass portion of the oil in pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of PVC in CO2 was lower than that in N2. These particular thermal degradation behaviors may be explained by the genuine role of CO2: the enhanced thermal cracking of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) evolved from the pyrolysis of PVC. The findings of this study strongly suggest that CO2 can be effectively applied to thermal disposal of recalcitrant wastes since employing CO2 in thermal treatment provides a means for in-situ mitigation and/or reduction of harmful chemical species.","The study investigates CO2-assisted thermal degradation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a waste plastic, using TGA, DTG, and DSC, with measurable product yield differences and analysis of harmful byproducts, confirming lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of a commercial plastic."
"Thermochemical recycling of end-of-life and virgin HDPE: A pilot-scale study Industrial-scale application of end-of-life plastic pyrolysis still faces significant problems, such as a lack of detailed knowledge on degradation mechanisms, parameters affecting the degradation, and formation pathways of the primary pyrolysis products. Today, the degradation mechanisms based on radical chain scission are insufficiently understood to explain the pyrolysis chemistry from feedstock-to-product comprehensively. In this study, the impact of operating conditions on the degradation mechanism is evaluated by pyrolyzing end-of-life and virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in a continuous pilot-scale unit at temperature and pressure ranges of 450–504 ºC and 0.1–2 bara. The pyrolysis products were analyzed based on the detailed product composition obtained using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). A simplified kinetic mechanism was proposed to describe the main production pathways of the various components by considering the weakest points along the polymer chain. The results showed that the chain-end scission mechanism is the main mechanism in the HDPE pyrolysis process, even at low temperatures and pressures in the studied ranges. The pyrolysis of virgin HDPE under sub-atmospheric pressure, 0.1 bara, at 464 ºC reactor temperature, yields the highest concentration of linear hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil (93.2 wt%). At higher pressure and temperature, the cyclic and branched hydrocarbons had a higher share of up to 17.4 wt% compared to 6.8 wt% at vacuum pressure and lower temperature. Interestingly, the pyrolysis of end-of-life HDPE at atmospheric pressure and 450 ºC led to more cyclic and branched hydrocarbons (sum: 22.1 wt%), as opposed to that of virgin HDPE which is more prone to the production of linear hydrocarbons at the studied conditions. Regarding the additives and contaminants, a large amount of different metals and halogen atoms in the ppm range were detected in end-of-life HDPE, of which a small amount was still found in the pyrolysis oil.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of end-of-life and virgin HDPE with measurable product yields, detailed product composition analysis, and reactor conditions, all of which are explicitly reported."
"Thermal-catalytic degradation kinetics of polypropylene over BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites In this study, thermal degradation of additive-free polypropylene powder over different type of zeolite catalysts was investigated. BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR with different surface areas, pore structures, acidities and Si/Al molar ratios were used as solid catalysts for degradation of polypropylene (PP). Degradation rate of the PP over zeolites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) employing four different heating rates and apparent activation energies of the processes were determined by the Kissinger equation. The catalytic activity of zeolites decreases as BEA>ZSM-5a (Si/Al=12.5)>ZSM-5b (Si/Al=25)>MOR depending on pore size and acidity of the catalysts. On the other hand, initial degradation is relatively faster over MOR and BEA than that over both ZSM-5 catalysts depending on the apparent activation energy. It can be concluded that acidity of the catalyst is the most important parameter in determining the activity for polymer degradation process as well as other structural parameters, such as pore structure and size.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of polypropylene waste plastic using zeolite catalysts, with measurable product degradation kinetics, activation energies, and catalyst performance data obtained via TGA and other analytical methods."
"Fractional distillation of waste plastic pyrolysis oil for isolating narrow hydrocarbons cuts Pyrolysis of polyolefins generates a large amount of olefins, which can serve as a valuable feedstock for the synthesis of chemicals. Nevertheless, their effective utilization requires refining owing to their diverse carbon distribution. This study performed a comprehensive GC×GC analysis of pyrolysis oils derived from waste polypropylene (PP) and waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The chemical composition of PP pyrolysis oil exhibited a high content of iso-olefins, whereas HDPE pyrolysis oil contained mainly alpha-olefins. Experimental batch distillation of PP pyrolysis oil yielded narrow hydrocarbon cuts with iso-olefins content exceeding 70 wt%. In contrast, distillation of HDPE resulted in cuts with more than 25 wt% alpha-olefins content. To perform ASPEN simulations, the physical properties (density, viscosity) of the oil were determined, two ways for obtaining boiling curves (ASTM D2887 and ASTM D86) were compared and two property methods (Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong) were compared. It was concluded that the ASTM D2887 boiling curve and the Peng-Robinson property method present better experimental agreement for pyrolysis oils using the Theil’s Inequality Coefficients test. Based on the validated batch simulation, continuous distillation process schemes for isolating narrow carbon cuts in the refinery atmospheric tower indicate that a side draw configuration provides a better yield of (19.1 wt%) compared to a dedicated separate distillation column of (11.9 wt%) for the same number of trays, while the dedicated column allows the possibility to achieve higher purity.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and high-density polyethylene, with measurable product yields, compositional analysis via GC×GC, and experimental distillation results."
"A novel tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading strategy for plastic waste to high-value products with zeolite and red mud This article proposed a novel tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading strategy for plastic waste using ZSM-5 and red mud catalysts to produce high-value gas-liquid-solid three-phase products. After using ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of various plastics (PE/PP/PET/PS) at 550 °C, the pyrolysis oil were collected and tested. Then, the red mud catalyst was further used to catalytic reformation of pyrolysis gas at 800 °C to obtain reforming gas and carbon materials. The obtained pyrolysis oil from tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process was in the range of 30.88–67.83 wt% with the aromatics selectivity of 73.8–94.4 area% for PE/PP/PET/PS. In addition to pyrolysis oil, PE and PP produced reforming gas rich in H2 and CH4 and carbon materials through tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process. After tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process, PET was converted into pyrolysis oil rich in 2-ring aromatics (with the selectivity of 49.5 area%) and synthesis gas rich in CO and H2. Finally, this article also revealed the reaction process of producing pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas, and carbon materials during the tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process of different plastics. The results demonstrated the effective utilization of both zeolite and red mud (an aluminum industry byproduct) as catalysts to achieve eco-friendly recycling of waste plastics for obtaining high-value gas-liquid-solid products, offering a practical framework for the large-scale industrial treatment of waste plastics.","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PET, PS) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis."
"Characterization of the waxes obtained by the pyrolysis of polyolefin plastics in a conical spouted bed reactor The thermal pyrolysis of three different polyolefin plastics (HDPE, LDPE and PP) has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor. This technology is especially interesting because of the high selectivity to waxes due to the low residence times and high heating rates that reduce secondary reactions and increase the yield of primary pyrolysis products (waxes). These have been obtained operating at 450, 500 and 600°C and a complete characterization has been carried out using different techniques, such as gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry, simulated distillation and the measurement of heating value and melting point. Operating conditions and feed type have been observed to have a significant effect on the properties of the different waxes. The characterization has been carried out bearing in mind the potential use of waste plastic-derived waxes as a feedstock for cracking units.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyolefin plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP) in a conical spouted bed reactor with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed analytical characterization of waxes."
"Fine-tuning the fountain confined spouted bed reactor for HDPE steam cracking: Influence of bed particle size and steam flow rate Achieving high selectivity towards valuable products is crucial for the industrial development of any technology. This study investigates the use of a fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor (FCSBR) for upcycling HDPE into light olefins and BTX aromatics. In order to progress towards a highly efficient reactor for HPDE steam cracking, operation fine-tuning with this reactor has been addressed. This novel reactor technology enables a transition from conventional spouting regime to a fountain enhanced regime, as well as preventing the elutriation of fine particles. In order to progress in the understanding of the role played by process conditions in the HDPE steam cracking, a study has been conducted by analyzing the influence of bed particle size and steam flow rate on product distribution. Thus, two different particle sizes (0.35–0.50 mm and 0.63–0.80 mm) and a wide range of water flow rates (from 2.5 to 10 mL min−1) covering from conventional spouting to fountain enhanced regimes were explored. The detailed evaluation of the results revealed the combined effect of residence time, gas–solid contact and effective volume available in the fountain for steam cracking reactions. Increasing the bed particle size to 0.63–0.80 mm resulted in a higher C2-C4 olefin yield of 53.5 wt%, but decreased the BTX fraction to 9.0 wt%, suggesting that finer particles enhance overcracking and secondary aromatization reactions. Therefore, coarse particles yielded the highest C2-C4 olefin fraction, as well as the highest ethylene yield of 33.3 wt%. Regarding the effect of steam flow rate, ethylene production peaked at 31.5 wt% with a water flow rate of 7.5 mL min−1, and high yields of BTX, ranging from 14.2 to 16.8 wt%, were obtained. However, using 5 mL min−1 of water with fine particles allowed the recovery of as much as 66.7 wt% of high added value products, i.e, light olefins and BTX fraction.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of HDPE plastic using a novel reactor, with measurable product yields and detailed analysis of temperature, particle size, and steam flow effects on product distribution."
"Coupling thermal and catalytic cracking of polymer wastes to boost carbon nanotubes production: Effects of HZSM-5 zeolites The efficient synthesis of carbon nanotubes from polymer wastes has been considered one promising technology for the effective management of current environment crisis. In the two-stage reaction system, HZSM-5 zeolites were introduced into the two-stage reaction system between the upper and lower stages, which was expected to upgrade the pyrolysis gas from polymer wastes and boost the growth of carbon nanotubes on Fe-Al2O3 catalyst. The physicochemical properties of HZSM-5 zeolites, Fe-Al2O3 catalyst and the as-obtained carbon materials were systematically characterized by XRD, N2 physisorption, 27Al MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, SEM, TEM, TG-DSC and Raman. It was found that the presence of HZSM-5 zeolites increased the length and yield, and narrowed the diameter of carbon nanotubes. In the absence of HZSM-5 zeolites, the yield of carbon nanotubes was 34 mg/g with an average diameter of 19 nm. The introduction of HZSM-5 and meso-HZSM-5 increased the yield of carbon nanotubes to 109 mg/g and 90 mg/g, and recduced the average diameter to 15 nm and 13 nm, respectively. The improvement of HZSM-5 zeolites on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes was observed for divrese polymer wastes inlcluding LDPE, HDPE and PP. It was attributed to the unique acidity and porosity of HZSM-5 zeolites, which enhanced the secondary cracking of the pyrolysis gas and the formation of light hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (LDPE, HDPE, PP) with measurable yields and product characterization, including catalyst effects and product analysis."
"Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic for liquid oil production Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most common polymers used in various plastic materials, and its degradation plays a significant role in sustainable environmental development. The objective of this study was to enhance the yield and quality of liquid oil derived from polypropylene plastics through microwave-assisted pyrolysis. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, microwave power, and PP loading on oil products were experimentally analyzed. The results revealed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 350 °C to 550 °C led to a rise in the yield of liquid oil from 0.027 to 0.793 g/g and then decreased to 0.657 g/g. With the increase in microwave power from 400 W to 800 W, the oil yield increased from 0.65 to 0.793 g/g and then dropped to 0.22 g/g. Furthermore, increasing the amount of PP from 20 g to 40 g resulted in an increase in oil yield from 0.345 to 0.793 g/g and then decreased to 0.713 g/g. An optimal oil yield was 0.793 g/g when the microwave power, pyrolysis temperature, and PP loading were 500 W, 450 °C, and 30 g respectively, and the oil was rich in cyclanes, alkenes and alkanes (about 97–99.6 area%). Additionally, the liquid oil primarily ranged from C8 to C15 (90.1 area%), indicating that microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene plastics raises the selectivity of small molecular products.","The study involves lab-scale microwave-assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed product composition analysis."
"Maximizing light olefin production via one-pot catalytic cracking of crude waste plastic pyrolysis oil Energy-efficient processes for converting polyolefinic waste plastics into light olefins are critical for mitigating environmental pollution and reducing carbon emissions. In this study, an alternative recycling scheme, the catalytic cracking of crude waste plastic pyrolysis oil (WPPO) over microspherical P-modified steam-treated ZSM-5 (ms-P-HZSM5-S), was demonstrated and compared to a state-of-the-art commercial scheme, the thermal cracking of a hydrotreated naphtha range of WPPO. The C2–C4 olefins yield achieved by the catalytic WPPO cracking (56.6 wt%) exceeded those achieved by the thermal WPPO cracking (36.1 wt%), thermal naphtha cracking (23.1 wt%), and catalytic naphtha cracking (29.7 wt%), which indicated the superiority of WPPO over naphtha as a feedstock. However, during a deactivation test over ms-P-HZSM5-S, coke accumulation resulted in a rapid decline in the yields of ethylene (from 17.2 to 14.6 wt%), propylene (from 25.8 to 23.6 wt%), and benzene, toluene, and xylenes (from 16.1 to 13.4 wt%) after a reaction time of 810 s (temperature = 680 °C, weight hourly space velocity = 16 h−1). Nevertheless, the catalytic performance was fully restored through regeneration in air at 730 °C, which confirmed the viability of continuous operation involving successive reaction–regeneration cycles. These findings can be leveraged to devise a new approach, the catalytic cracking of WPPO integrated with a continuous regeneration (e.g., circulating fluidized bed reactor) system, which could offer several advantages over the commercial strategy, including the posttreatment-free utilization of the entire WPPO range, higher light olefins yields, continuous coke removal, reduced energy consumption, and non-necessity of H2.","The study involves catalytic cracking of crude waste plastic pyrolysis oil, a direct product of plastic pyrolysis, with measurable yields of light olefins and detailed experimental conditions and catalyst performance data."
"Lumped kinetic modelling of polyolefin pyrolysis: A non-isothermal method to estimate rate constants The measurement of kinetic parameters in the pyrolysis of polyolefins requires the use of a lumped kinetic model for predicting the product distribution of wax, oil and gas yields. A non-isothermal method was established, in which a sample is heated in a tube reactor to a desired temperature at a constant rate of temperature rise. This method avoided the error present in the heating up stage which is inherent in any practical isothermal method in which reaction proceeds to a significant extent before the operating temperatures of polyolefin pyrolysis are reached, which results in challenges when defining the reaction time. The non-isothermal measurements were conducted between 450 and 550 °C for polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) and the temperature and lump yields are non-linearly regressed to achieve the kinetic parameters. The measured kinetic rate constants have the same trend as those reported in the literature using the isothermal method, but are lower than the values reported at similar conditions. The kinetic parameters derived are then validated by using isothermal experimental data. The calculated data using the measured kinetic parameters are generally in agreement with the experimental data. The non-isothermal method established in this work proves to be a much faster method for the measurement of intrinsic rate constants at high temperatures.","The study involves lab-scale non-isothermal pyrolysis of polyolefins (PP, HDPE, LDPE) in a tube reactor with measurable yields and kinetic parameter extraction, satisfying all required criteria."
"Box-Behnken design approach towards optimization of activated carbon synthesized by co-pyrolysis of waste polyester textiles and MgCl2 Pyrolysis activation of waste polyester textiles (WPT) was regarded as a sustainable technique to synthesize multi-pore activated carbons. MgO-template method of using MgCl2 as the template precursor was employed, which possessed the advantages of ideal pore-forming effect and efficient preparation process. The response surface methodology coupled with Box-Behnken design (BBD) was conducted to study the interaction between different variables and optimized preparation conditions of waste polyester textiles based activated carbons. Derived from BBD design results, carbonization temperature was the most significant individual factor. And the maximum specific surface area of 1364m2/g, which presented a good agreement with the predicted response values(1315m2/g), was obtained at mixing ratio in MgCl2/WPT, carbonization temperature and time of 5:1, 900°C and 90min, respectively. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the sample prepared under optimal conditions were carried on utilizing nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, EA, XRD, SEM and FTIR. In addition, the pore-forming mechanism was mainly attributed to the tendency of carbon layer coating on MgO to form pore walls after elimination of MgO and the strong dehydration effect of MgCl2 on WPT.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polyester textiles with MgCl2 activation, including measured yields, optimized conditions, and analytical characterization of products."
"Unlocking circular economy potential: Evaluating high-value chemical production from pyrolysis of plastics recovered from landfilled municipal solid waste This study evaluates the potential for producing valuable chemical products from plastics recovered from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and therefore contributing to waste reduction and resource recovery. Using pyrolysis–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) we analysed the decomposition products of 10 plastic samples including fresh and excavated samples of different landfill periods from 4 landfill sites. The samples comprised polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), two mixed excavated plastic materials containing PE, PP, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). All samples were pyrolyzed at 350, 500, 650 and 800 °C to semi-quantitatively identify the range of compounds produced at each temperature. Hydrocarbon production was the highest at 500 °C and 650 °C whit a significant proportion of the products falling within the naphtha range (C6-C10), which is a critical feedstock in the plastic industry. Notably, naphtha can be cracked to produce 55 wt% high-value chemicals, such as ethylene and propylene. Additionally, aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene and styrene, especially in the mixed samples demonstrate potential for use in the chemical industries for polymers, solvents and dyes. These results provide encouraging evidence that excavated landfill plastics can serve as a viable source of valuable chemical intermediates, supporting both resource recovery and the advancement of a circular plastics economy. While this study offers an important initial assessment, primarily qualitative and focused on single polymers and controlled artificial mixtures, it establishes a solid foundation for future research. Further investigations using heterogeneous and larger-scale processing are recommended to fully demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility and environmental benefits of integrating pyrolysis of aged plastics into sustainable waste management and resource recovery strategies.","The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PET, PVC) from landfill, with experimental data on product yields and composition at varying temperatures, including GC–MS analysis and quantitative assessment of naphtha and aromatic compounds."
"In-situ adsorptive pyrolysis of e-waste using coal and rice husk fly ash as alternative adsorbents for energy and precious metal recovery by solvent extraction This paper aims to use in-situ adsorptive pyrolysis combined with ultrasonication and solvent extraction for precious metal recovery from e-waste. The pyrolysis of discarded printed circuit board (PCB) and waste cable (WC) resulted in pyrolysis oil yields of 4.2–13.0 and 6.8–13.5%, respectively. Aliphatic and single-ring compounds were the major components of the pyrolysis oil. The pyrolysis char was ultrasonicated at 40 kHz for 20, 30, and 40 min at 35 °C to separate precious metals in pyrolysis char. The amounts of Au and Ag recovered by solvent extraction experiments with 2%vol HCl/2%vol HNO3, 2%vol HNO3 and 2%vol I2/2%vol H2O2 were 36.3–61.4 and 60.7–79.9%, respectively. The total energy recovery from the pyrolysis char, oil, and gas obtained from the pyrolysis of PCB was 9.0–9.2 MJ/kg. These results indicated that in-situ adsorptive pyrolysis with ultrasonication and solvent extraction could potentially facilitate e-waste conversion for energy and metal recovery processes at a lower cost.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastics (PCB and waste cable) with measurable product yields, characterized pyrolysis oil composition, and energy recovery data."
"Catalytic cracking of chlorinated heavy wax from pyrolysis of plastic wastes to low carbon-range fuels: Catalyst effect on properties of liquid products and dechlorination Catalytic conversion of useless chlorinated heavy wax (chlorine, 0.14 wt%) obtained from pyrolysis of refuse plastic fuel was studied using iron oxide impregnated HY zeolite to produce a useful liquid product. It was found that the largest liquid fraction (gasoline and kerosene/ diesel, 66.9 wt.%) with very low chlorine content was achieved when using Fe[3]/HY among impregnated HY catalysts. This demonstrated that the Fe impregnated HY catalyst had a dual function of catalytic cracking of HY zeolite and dechlorination of iron oxide. Excessive impregnation of Fe, i.e., Fe[20]/HY, showed the least cracking activity of heavy wax owing to the catalyst having lowest total acid sites, but yielded liquid product with the lowest chlorine content (60 ppm) among the tested catalysts. The spent catalysts were deposited by a significant amount of soft coke and chlorine, and they were totally restored by thermal treatment in air (700 ℃).","The study involves lab-scale catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste, with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and analytical characterization of liquid products."
"Thermal degradation of poly(methyl methacrylate) polymers: Kinetics and recovery of monomers using a fluidized bed reactor Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a versatile transparent thermoplastic that is used in a wide range of fields and applications, such as in the lenses of exterior lights of automobiles, in electronics, in food containers and in artificial marble. When PMMA is subject to thermal degradation conditions, it degrades mainly into its monomer, methyl methacrylate (MMA). In this study, a virgin PMMA copolymer composed of 97.5% methyl methacrylate, 2.5% methyl acrylate (MA) and PMMA waste plastics were investigated. Kinetic measurements of the thermal degradation of the virgin copolymer were carried out with a TGA. The Chatterjee–Conrad (CC) and Freeman–Caroll (FC) models were applied to determine the pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Both models simulated the experimental DTG curves fairly well. In addition, pyrolysis of the virgin copolymer and the PMMA wastes was carried out using a fluidized bed reactor to recover the monomer. The reaction temperatures ranged from 450 to 500°C. In each case, the rate of oil recovery was over 97%, and the content of the MMA in the oils was up to 98wt%. The MMA recovered from the experiments can be used as feedstock for the polymerization of PMMA.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PMMA waste plastics in a fluidized bed reactor, with measurable yields and product composition analysis, satisfying all required conditions."
"Co-pyrolysis of palm shell and polystyrene waste mixtures to synthesis liquid fuel The mixtures of palm shell and polystyrene waste were pyrolyzed to obtain a high-grade of pyrolytic liquid that potentially could be used as a fuel. Three effective parameters were chosen: temperature, feed ratio, and reaction time. The first phase of the study was a screening test to select the range point of each parameter that resulted in high production of liquid. The selected points were then used as reference data for an optimization study using response surface methodology. The maximum liquid yield of approximately 68.3% was obtained under optimum conditions, which were shown to be a temperature of 600°C, a palm shell/polystyrene ratio of 40:60, and a reaction time of 45min. The characterization results showed that the high heating value of the liquid obtained was 40.34MJ/kg with a water content of 1.9wt% and an oxygen content 4.24wt%. The liquid mainly consisted of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste polystyrene and palm shell mixtures, with measurable product yields, optimized reaction conditions, and detailed characterization of the pyrolytic liquid."
"Effect of HZSM-5 catalyst addition on the cracking of polyolefin pyrolysis waxes under FCC conditions A study has been carried out on the effect of catalyst acidity and composition (mixtures of base catalyst and catalysts provided with HZSM-5 zeolite of different acidity) on the catalytic cracking of polyolefin pyrolysis waxes carried out under standard conditions in a refinery FCC. The experiments have been carried out in a riser simulator, in the 500–550°C range. The results show that the yields and composition of product stream are acceptable and controlable by refineries without any special adaptation of process conditions. The acidity of the catalysts has a relevant effect on hydrogen transfer capacity, which contributes to decreasing the concentration of olefins in the gases and in the gasoline. The incorporation of HZSM-5 zeolite is very efficient for increasing the yield of gasoline. This gasoline and LPG are more olefinic than those obtained with the base catalyst, given that hydrogen transfer capacity of the catalyst is inhibited.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin pyrolysis waxes, a plastic-derived feedstock, in a lab-scale riser simulator with measurable yields, product composition, and catalyst performance data."
"Hydrogenative pyrolysis of waste tires Hydrogenative pyrolysis of waste tires, using 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin) as a model hydrogen donor, was carried out in a stirred batch reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature, kept constant during each run, was varied in the range 260–430°C. Either tire granules (≈ 2 mm size) or tire particles (size less than 500 μm) were used. Liquid-phase and gas-phase samples were withdrawn at regular intervals during each reaction run. The gas samples and the gas present in the reactor at the end of each run were collected in a bag and analyzed. The analysis of samples was performed by gas-chromatography, usually with flame ionization detection (FID), although a mass spectrometry detector (MSD) was used for initial identification of the reaction products. More than 150 major chemical compounds in the gas and liquid phases, produced by the tire depolymerization, were detected and their concentrations were evaluated as a function of the reaction time. Liquid samples were also analyzed with a thermogravimetric (TG) balance to ascertain the presence of compounds having such high boiling points as to be undetectable by gas-chromatography. In order to check if the compounds detected represented all the tire pyrolysis products a mass balance was performed. The results of the investigation permit the identification of the most convenient operating conditions for obtaining complete depolymerization. Correspondingly, the recovery of chemicals achievable was determined.","The study involves lab-scale experimental pyrolysis of waste tires, a type of plastic-containing waste, with measurable product yields, temperature–yield relationships, and detailed chemical analysis of pyrolysis products."
"Thermal degradation of plywood with block polypropylene in TG and batch reactor system The copyrolysis of plywood and block polypropylene (PP) was carried out in a batch reactor system, and analyzed via TGA and Py-GC/MS. Specific attention was paid to the diagnosis of the interaction between the plywood and block polypropylene during their copyrolysis, with the relationship between the interaction and improvement in the quality of the bio-oil explained. From the TGA results, the window of the decomposition temperature of PP during copyrolysis was slightly increased, indicating that the products from the pyrolysis of plywood affected the characteristic of the pyrolysis of PP. The new products not observed in the single component pyrolysis were formed and the quantities of products appeared in the single component pyrolysis also varied. In the batch reactor system, the bio-oil yield was increased and the amounts of oxygen and water decreased. Consequently, the heating value of the bio-oil was increased.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of waste plastic (block polypropylene) and biomass (plywood) in a batch reactor with measurable product yields, temperature analysis, and product composition characterization."
"Temperature programmed decomposition of polypropylene: in situ FTIR coupled with mass spectroscopy study The temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) technique coupled with the in situ infrared (IR)/mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis has been employed to study the thermal decomposition of polypropylene. These techniques, especially when coupled with a gas chromatograph (GC), are effective for determining thermal stability, product distribution and product evolution as a function of temperature. The polymer decomposes at approximately 475K yielding hydrocarbons in the C1–C7 range, with propylene, C5 and C6 composing the majority of gaseous products. Decomposition over alumina and 5 wt% Ni/Al2O3 with and without the presence of hydrogen does not affect thermal stability. Also, decomposition over alumina with and without the presence of hydrogen does not affect the depolymerization pathway. The popular β-scission/backbiting mechanism cannot fully explain observations from this study. Possible alternatives are explored.","The study involves lab-scale thermal decomposition of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable product yields and composition analysis using in situ FTIR and MS."
"Removal of nitrogen, bromine, and chlorine from PP/PE/PS/PVC/ABS–Br pyrolysis liquid products using Fe- and Ca-based catalysts The thermal and catalytic degradation of a complex polymer mixture was performed at 450°C at atmospheric pressure in a batch process. The mixture contained polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene copolymer with a brominated flame retardant and antimony oxide synergist (ABS–Br) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), in a 3/3/2/1/1 weight ratio. The effect of iron (FeOOH and Fe–C composite) and calcium (CaCO3 and Ca–C composite) based catalysts for removal of heteroatom- (nitrogen, bromine, and chlorine) containing compounds in oil products was studied. Changes in the amount and distribution of heteroatoms were described using NP gram curves. Iron catalysts give best results for bromine removal from decomposition oil while calcium catalysts have high efficiency for chlorine removal; however, both Fe- and Ca-catalysts have low effect in nitrogen removal. Carbon composite catalysts give three times less chlorine but they produce higher amounts of nitrogen in degradation oils than the corresponding Fe and Ca pure compounds. In bromine removal Ca–C composite shows higher effect compared to CaCO3 while Fe–C composite has slightly worse effect than FeOOH.","The study involves lab-scale batch pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, ABS–Br) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and heteroatom removal analysis using experimental characterization techniques."
"Enhanced energy recovery from polyethylene terephthalate via pyrolysis in CO2 atmosphere while suppressing acidic chemical species Herein, CO2 is employed as a pyrolysis medium for thermal treatment (i.e., pyrolysis) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste in an environmentally benign way. The CO2-assited pyrolysis provides a novel way to not only enhance energy recovery from the PET waste but also reduce acidic byproducts such as benzoic acid. The generation of carbon monoxide (CO) for pyrolysis of the PET waste in CO2 is ∼5 times more than that in N2. In addition to the enhancement of CO generation, the compositions of benzene derivatives, PAHs, and acidic compounds are lower in pyrolytic products in CO2 than that in N2. This study suggests that the employment of CO2 in pyrolysis of PET waste would be a more environmentally friendly waste treatment process with enhancing energy recovery.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of PET waste in a CO2 atmosphere with measurable product yields and compositional analysis of pyrolytic products, including reduced acidic compounds and enhanced CO generation."
"Enhanced production of BTX from PET-LDPE co-pyrolysis via Ga- and Zn-impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts The coexistence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyolefins in plastic waste poses a significant challenge for pyrolysis-based recycling, as PET decomposition generates oxygenates that reduce product quality. To address this, we developed a two-stage reactor system that catalytically upgrades vapors from PET–LDPE mixtures using Ga- and Zn-impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts. XPS analysis revealed that impregnation with Ga and Zn leads to the formation of GaOx and ZnOH+ species, which introduce new Lewis acid sites. When these sites are located near Brønsted acid sites, synergistic interactions enhance both deoxygenation and aromatization, improving the catalytic performance of HZSM-5. At 600 °C, PET pyrolysis produces significant amounts of CO2, CO, and benzoic acid, resulting in oxygen-rich pyrolysis oil. While unmodified HZSM-5 achieves full deoxygenation, the resulting PyOil yield is modest, ranging from 24 to 34 wt%. In contrast, Ga- and Zn-modified catalysts increase PyOil yield to ∼50 wt% and improve mono-aromatic (BTX) selectivity to 80–89 % by shifting the acid site distribution toward weaker acidity, thereby favoring decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and aromatization. Notably, Zn-HZSM-5 maintained high BTX selectivity even with increasing PET content, outperforming Ga-HZSM-5, which exhibited higher polyaromatic hydrocarbon formation under similar conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of Ga- and Zn-modified HZSM-5 catalysts for the efficient conversion of mixed plastic waste into BTX-rich oils suitable for fuel and chemical applications.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (PET and LDPE) with measurable product yields, catalyst performance, and product composition analysis using experimental methods."
"Shaped zeolites Y for polypropylene cracking This study focuses on chemical interactions occurring between commercially available FAU zeolites, with various Si/Al ratios (Si/Al = 2.5, 6, and 31), micro- and mesoporosity, acidic properties, and a γ-Al2O3 used as a binder to produce extrudates. The extrudates are characterised by conventional techniques that provide information on their structure, texture, and acidic features and are compared to their parent powders. The catalytic performances of the zeolite powders, their derived alumina extrudates, and physical mixtures of zeolites/γ-Al2O3 are evaluated in polypropylene catalytic cracking. A detailed thermogravimetric and spectroscopic (operando FT-IR-GC-MS) analysis of the reaction, including catalyst coking and regeneration, shows the emergence of rules to design fit-for-purpose catalysts. IR spectroscopy-derived number, nature, and strength of the acid sites are consistent with the catalytic results, highlighting the role of new catalytic sites located on the external or mesoporous surfaces of the zeolites, i.e., at the zeolite-binder interface. This illustrates that binding and subsequent thermal treatment of zeolite powders to produce industrially relevant catalysts determine the quality and quantity of active sites not always present in pure powders, typically reported in the open literature. During the shaping process, neither the strength nor accessibility of the native zeolite acid sites are affected, but chemical interactions between γ-Al2O3 and the zeolite generate new Brønsted acid sites, increasing catalytic performances in polypropylene cracking. This study is also a blueprint for other zeolites/binders forming processes (spray-drying, oil-dropping, pelletising) and could also be influential in shaping adsorbents. It is remarkable that, despite a significant dilution (50 %) of USY zeolites with γ-Al2O3, no significant change in catalytic activity is observed while the newly created sites improve selectivity towards lighter hydrocarbons.","The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene, a commercial plastic, with measurable catalytic performance, product analysis, and reactor condition data."
"Controlled pyrolysis of polyethylene/polypropylene/polystyrene mixed plastics with high impact polystyrene containing flame retardant: Effect of decabromo diphenylethane (DDE) The pyrolysis of polyethylene(PE)/polypropylene(PP)/polystyrene(PS) mixed with high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) containing decabromo diphenylethane (DDE) as a brominated flame retardant with antimony trioxide as a synergist was performed under controlled temperature programmed pyrolysis (two steps) conditions to understand the decomposition behaviour and evolution of brominated hydrocarbons from flame-retardant additives. The liquid products were extensively analyzed by gas chromatographs equipped with FID, ECD, MSD, TCD, AED and FT-IR. The solid residue samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction and combustion followed by ion-chromatography. The controlled pyrolysis of PE/PP/PS/HIPS-Br significantly affected the decomposition behaviour of HIPS-Br and subsequently the formation of decomposition products. GC/ECD analysis confirmed that the brominated hydrocarbons were concentrated in step 1 liquid products leaving less brominated hydrocarbons in the step 2 liquid products, similar to the decabromo diphenyl ether flame retardant containing mixed plastics. The yield of liquid products in step 1 from 3P/DDE-Sb(5) was 5wt% and from 3P/DDE-Sb(0) was 2.4wt%. The presence of antimony in the DDE containing plastics affected the yield of liquid, gas and residue products. ECD analysis showed that the presence of antimony increased the Br containing hydrocarbons and step 1 has 3–4 times higher brominated compounds than step 2 hydrocarbons in both the samples.","The study involves lab-scale controlled pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, HIPS-Br) with measurable product yields, analytical characterization, and detailed experimental data on brominated hydrocarbon formation and catalyst effects."
"Carbon black preparation by partial oxidation of spent tyre pyrolysis oil – Influence of temperature, residence time and oxygen to feed ratio Preparation of carbon black (CB) by partial oxidation of the spent tyre pyrolysis oil (STPO) and its heavy residue fraction (HRF) was systematically studied using a lab-scale drop tube furnace. The effect of furnace operating temperature (T: 1100 to 1400 °C), residence time (tr : 5 to 60 s) and oxygen to feed ratio (O/F: 174 to 732) on the yield and quality of CB was examined using the response surface methodology (RSM). T was shown to have the most significant influence on CB yield and properties. While the CB yield was also influenced by tr , the quality was more sensitively dependent on T and O/F. The predicted optimal tr and O/F were approximately the same for both feedstocks (60 s and 174, respectively). However, T was higher for the HRF feedstock (1368 °C) than the STPO feedstock (1331 °C) due to the abundance of more viscous heavy hydrocarbons in HRF. Validation experiments under the aforementioned conditions demonstrated the models’ ability to predict responses accurately. The CB from both feedstocks had low contents of ash (<0.03%), volatiles (∼0.5%), sulphur (<0.7%), and high carbon (≥95%). The BET surface area and average primary particle size for CB from STPO and HRF were comparable to those of commercial CBs from fossil fuel feedstock. The CB from HRF had a higher carboxyl oxygen functional group (18%) compared to the CB from STPO (∼13%) and commercial CB (<5%).","The study involves pyrolysis of spent tire rubber, a waste plastic material, with lab-scale experiments using a drop tube furnace, measurable product yields, and detailed characterization of carbon black properties."
"Thermochemical processing for the sustainable disposal of spent filter waste High-efficiency particulate air filters are widely used for indoor air purification. Spent filter waste (SFW), which can trap infectious and toxic substances, is primarily treated via incineration. This method causes environmental concerns, particularly regarding the generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants. To cope with these issues, this work proposes the pyrolysis of SFW using CO2 as a sustainable alternative to conventional incineration. The introduction of CO2 enhanced reactivity during pyrolysis, potentially offering a more sustainable process. The SFW consisted of filtered particles and two distinct filter/support layers, and the presence of toxic chemicals and primary polymer constituents was characterized. While CO2 had a minimal impact on enhancing syngas production, owing to its slow reaction rate during SFW pyrolysis, adding a nickel-based catalyst significantly improved CO2 reactivity. This resulted in a 649.7% increase in carbon monoxide (CO) production compared to that in pyrolysis under N2. The potential of this pyrolysis system for reducing CO2 emissions was evaluated against that of conventional incineration. Overall, this study presents a promising method for the pyrolytic conversion of SFW into combustible gases, particularly CO, while leveraging CO2 utilisation to mitigate global warming.","The study involves lab-scale pyrolysis of spent filter waste (SFW), a plastic-containing waste material, with measurable product yields and catalyst performance data, including a 649.7% increase in CO production with a nickel-based catalyst."
