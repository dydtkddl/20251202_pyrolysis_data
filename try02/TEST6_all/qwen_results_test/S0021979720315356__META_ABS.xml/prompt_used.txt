You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of arabinoxylan on the drying of cellulose nanocrystals suspension: From coffee ring to Maltese cross pattern and application to enzymatic detection Evaporation of sessile droplet containing suspension of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) results on birefringent coffee ring pattern (CR), due to the concentration increase and self-assembly of CNC carried by the flow at the edge of evaporating droplet. In this work, we studied the apparition of Maltese cross pattern, (MC) after addition of an hydrosoluble biopolymer belonging to the hemicellulose family, i.e. arabinoxylan (AX). To investigate the mechanisms that control MC pattern apparition, distribution of the two components inside the dried droplet was investigated using FTIR. CNC and AX were found to be homogenously deposited and CNC self-assembly induces nanoparticles orientation in the CR deposit. We demonstrate that the increase of concentration during drying induces gelation of CNC/AX mixture leading to MC pattern apparition. We take advantage of the apparition of MC pattern to develop a novel catalytic activity detection assay based on the variation of viscosity. Indeed, addition of Endo-1,4-β-Xylanase (Xyl) addition to a suspension containing CNC/AX complex leads to hydrolysis of AX that decrease in droplet viscosity leading to MC disappearance. The enzymatic detection assay is thus simple, easy to handle, fast, sensitive and do not require complex analytical devices.
