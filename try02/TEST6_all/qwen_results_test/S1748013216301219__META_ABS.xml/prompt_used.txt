You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

2D nanosheets-based novel architectures: Synthesis, assembly and applications The discovery of graphene attracted great interest because of the potential prospects of which in both basic and applied research. And other kinds of 2D graphene analogues, including hexagonal BN, carbon nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides, etc. derived from their layered bulk crystals, have also been extensively investigated because of their promising characters and potential applications. It is expected that these 2D nanosheets, in bulk or in composite materials, could maintain their extraordinary properties. However, the irreversible aggregation or accumulating of 2D nanosheets due to the strong van der Waals interactions, extremely decrease their accessible surface area. More recently, with the recognization of the tremendous interest of these 2D structures, scientists noticed that the performance of certain devices could be significantly improved by utilizing 3D architectures and/or aerogels due to the increase of unit activity of the materials. This review summarizes different synthetic process (such as assembly, chemical vapor deposition direct synthesis, in-situ confinement growth and so on) used for preparation of 2D graphene analogues based 3D architectures and/or aerogels containing either any or their composites. And the different fields of application for energy storage (including both supercapacitor and lithium ion battery applications), electrocatalysis, sensing and others are provided a significant enhancement in the efficacy as compared to their 2D analogues or even opened the path to novel application. In addition, some perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this promising research area are also discussed.
