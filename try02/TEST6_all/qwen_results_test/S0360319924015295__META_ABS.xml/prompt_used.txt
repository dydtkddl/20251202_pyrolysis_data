You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From methane to hydrogen: A comprehensive review to assess the efficiency and potential of turquoise hydrogen technologies Hydrocarbons are important for many countries' economy and represent a major part of the energy supply chain, at least in the foreseeable future. The proven oil and gas reserves globally represent a formidable energy resource that could meet the world's current energy demand for approximately 100 years. As the world shifts to a low carbon future, the market for oil and gas will be affected. Hence, the development of approaches and technologies to valorize these hydrocarbons, while reducing the impact on the environmental will be required. One such approach is to extract hydrogen (H2) from hydrocarbons while capturing and using or storing carbon dioxide (CO2). Another near-term economical solution that paves the way for scalable hydrogen infrastructure is methane (CH4) pyrolysis, also called thermal methane cracking, methane decomposition or turquoise hydrogen. This comprehensive review examines the state-of-the-art in methane pyrolysis for hydrogen production and valuable solid carbon, highlighting the method's potential and addressing the persistent challenges that impede its commercialization. The study evaluates various approaches, including solid catalysts, molten mediums, and plasma-assisted methods. The limitations and drawbacks of each technique are discussed. The synergy between the hydrogen and carbon industries is highlighted, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to unlock the full potential of methane pyrolysis. In addition to evaluating existing challenges, the review provides strategic recommendations for overcoming hurdles, including innovations in catalyst design, optimization of molten media, and industry partnerships. It also emphasizes the importance of policy engagement, comprehensive cost and lifecycle analysis, and technological innovations to propel methane pyrolysis toward commercial success. The comprehensive assessment presented in this review aims to guide future research directions, foster collaboration between academia and industry, and contribute to the development of a sustainable and economically viable methane pyrolysis process for hydrogen production and valuable solid carbon.
