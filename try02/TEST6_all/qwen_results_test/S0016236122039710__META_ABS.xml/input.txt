Co-pyrolysis of heavy bio-oil and disposable masks pyrolysate with Ce/Fe-based oxygen carrier catalyst Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of heavy components of bio-oils is an effective way to improve the quality of bio-oil into fuel oil. Up to now, in-situ hydrogenation technology is a popular upgrading approach because of its economy, simplicity and efficiency, and the developing suitable hydrogenation catalyst and hydrogen donor is one of the key issues. In light of that, the effects of different reaction temperatures and times in the high pressure reactor on the in-situ hydrogenation of heavy bio-oil were investigated and the upgrading experiments of heavy bio-oil were carried out with the addition of the reduced Ce/Fe-based oxygen carrier (OC) and mask pyrolysate. The results showed that the reduced Ce/Fe-based OC played a dual function of carrying oxygen and catalysis, and the disposable mask pyrolysate was an excellent hydrogen donor to transport active hydrogen. Compared with the untreated bio-oil oxygenated compounds, the physicochemical properties and yield of the liquid products obtained by HDO of heavy bio-oil were higher. Under the action of active hydrogen, the oxygenated compounds could be converted into hydrocarbons (6.34 % to 41.24 %-68.54 %) by HDO. The effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio ((H/C) eff) of the liquid products (1.08 to 1.74–1.94) and the higher heating value (HHV) (27.75 MJ/kg to 31.64–37.05 MJ/kg) were increased. Particularly, the liquid products collected at 300℃ and 30 min had better performance (HHV 37.05 MJ/Kg and liquid yield 68.45 %). In addition, the liquid products had excellent fluidity. Therefore, the liquid products basically had the characteristics of fuel oil. This work might provide a reference for recycling disposable masks.
