You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Theoretical estimates of flammability bounds for thin condensed fuel diffusion flames in microgravity using detailed models of chemistry and radiation Recently, U-shape flammability maps have been constructed showing minimal oxygen vs. flame strain for opposed flame spread in micro-gravity by Olson and Ferkul (2017). The U-shape defines the limiting flammability bounds from radiative extinction and flame blow-off. The minimum of the U corresponds to the minimum possible oxidizer concentration where burning can occur, and is an important quantity of interest for fire safety. While high strain extinction bounds have been well analyzed, low strain radiative extinction has not. To estimate low strain extinction, in this study an analytical theory is developed based on thin flame theory coupled with a heat and mass transfer model for solid fuels. A reaction progress variable based on the Damköhler number is adapted in the theory to account for incomplete combustion at high strain rates and enable the capturing of the full flammability map. The analytical model is compared to a one dimensional numerical model w/ detailed chemical kinetics and coupled radiation heat transfer in planar and spherical geometries. The flammability maps are then qualitatively compared to experimental extinguishment data compiled by Olson and Ferkul for cylindrical rods of PMMA showing similar trends. The results show the newly developed analytics capture the radiative extinction bound compared to the numerical model and qualitatively agrees with microgravity data.
