You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics of alcoholysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) in sub- and super-critical isooctyl alcohol to produce dioctyl terephthalate The alcoholysis kinetics of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) in sub- and super-critical isooctyl alcohol (2-EH) to produce dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP) was studied with a batch reactor under the temperature range from 533 to 653K. Owing to the fast decomposition of DOTP to terephthalic acid (TPA) in the super-critical 2-EH, the kinetics was studied according to two conditions based on temperature less and more than critical temperature of 2-EH as pseudo-first-order reaction. In the sub-critical 2-EH about the temperature range of 533–593K, the decomposition of DOTP was very slow, and thus the apparent activation energy of production rate of DOTP is determined to be 82.14kJ/mol without taking into account decomposition of DOTP. Whereas, as for the super-critical 2-EH, the decompositions of DOTP should be taken into account, and a consecutive pseudo-first-order reaction model from PET to DOTP, TPA and subsequent decomposition products is adopted. The apparent activation energies of production rates of DOTP are 30.29kJ/mol and the decomposition values of DOTP and TPA are 128.14 and 176.43kJ/mol of the super-critical temperature range of 613–653K.
