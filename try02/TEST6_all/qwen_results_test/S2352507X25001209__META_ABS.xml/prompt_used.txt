You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Four-dimensional (4D) printing of naturally-derived hydroxyapatite nanocomposite-based scaffolds for biomedical applications: A review Due to advancements in 4D printing (4DP) technology, bioprinted materials can have many functions and dynamic features. Occluders, stents, microneedles, wound closures, smart cell microenvironments, implants, and drug delivery systems, are some examples of biomedical objects that have been manufactured using 4DP peocess. Due to similarity to bioapatite, hydroxyapatite nanocomposites (HAp NCs) are promising biomaterials in tissue engineering. Conventionally, bone/tissue engineering has extensively used HAp NCs due to their osteogenic and biocompatible qualities. However, traditional HAp production procedures restrict their extensive application in fabrication of biomedical materials, including bones, teeth, cartilage, etc. Novel techniques like 4DP have been used to create customized HAp NC–based scaffolds for the patients. In this review, we provide an overview of different 4DP methods that are utilized in the HAp NC-based scaffolds fabrication. Various natural sources of HAp and different synthesis methods have been investigated. Several 4DP HAp NC-based scaffolds, their properties, biomedical applications, advantages, disadvantages, and future prospects are discussed.
