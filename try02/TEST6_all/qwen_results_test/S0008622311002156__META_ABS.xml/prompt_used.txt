You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dual-template synthesis of magnetically-separable hierarchically-ordered porous carbons by catalytic graphitization Magnetically-separable hierarchically-ordered porous carbons with graphitic structures (HPC-G) have been directly synthesized by one-pot dual-templating with evaporation-induced self-assembly at calcination temperatures ranging between 600 and 1000°C. Polystyrene latex spheres and triblock copolymer F127 were used as macro- and meso-porous structure-directing agents, while phenol–formaldehyde resins and Ni species were added as the carbon source and graphitization catalyst, respectively. The microstructures in terms of morphology, surface area, pore texture, thermal stability, degree of graphitization and magnetic properties were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, X-ray powder diffraction, surface area analysis, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Addition of nickel species catalyzes the graphitization of HPC-G at relatively low carbonization temperatures under different atmospheres (N2 or H2/N2). The HPC-G exhibits well-crystallized graphitic domains, excellent magnetic properties, uniform and interconnected porous structures, and high surface area. The magnetically-separable HPC-G shows a high adsorption capacity for methylene blue and improved electrocatalytic activity towards I 3 - and I2 reductions in dye-sensitized solar cells. Results obtained in this study allow us to develop an environmentally friendly technique for fabrication of HPC with well-crystallized graphitic carbon and magnetically-separable properties for novel applications.
