Dual-template synthesis of magnetically-separable hierarchically-ordered porous carbons by catalytic graphitization Magnetically-separable hierarchically-ordered porous carbons with graphitic structures (HPC-G) have been directly synthesized by one-pot dual-templating with evaporation-induced self-assembly at calcination temperatures ranging between 600 and 1000°C. Polystyrene latex spheres and triblock copolymer F127 were used as macro- and meso-porous structure-directing agents, while phenol–formaldehyde resins and Ni species were added as the carbon source and graphitization catalyst, respectively. The microstructures in terms of morphology, surface area, pore texture, thermal stability, degree of graphitization and magnetic properties were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, X-ray powder diffraction, surface area analysis, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Addition of nickel species catalyzes the graphitization of HPC-G at relatively low carbonization temperatures under different atmospheres (N2 or H2/N2). The HPC-G exhibits well-crystallized graphitic domains, excellent magnetic properties, uniform and interconnected porous structures, and high surface area. The magnetically-separable HPC-G shows a high adsorption capacity for methylene blue and improved electrocatalytic activity towards I 3 - and I2 reductions in dye-sensitized solar cells. Results obtained in this study allow us to develop an environmentally friendly technique for fabrication of HPC with well-crystallized graphitic carbon and magnetically-separable properties for novel applications.
