You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A systematic review on nitrogen control during hydrothermal carbonization of sewage sludge under PRISMA guidelines The rising global production of sewage sludge (SS), driven by urbanization, presents substantial challenges for effective management due to its high moisture content and disposal costs. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is an effective thermochemical method for converting SS into valuable products while minimizing energy use. In addition, HTC can also remove nitrogen (N) from hydrochar (HC) and process water. The current review examined the removal of N in SS using HTC and analyzes the impact of additives (such as oxides, acids and inorganics) on the behavior of nutrients and heavy metals. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines on N control during HTC. The key findings revealed that HTC significantly influences N recovery, with optimal conditions for N removal identified at temperatures around 280°C. Moreover, HTC was identified as an effective method for N recovery by achieving approximately 80 % recovery, whereas the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) achieves only 5.49 % N recovery. By advancing our understanding of N recovery, this study recommends more effective SS management and resource recovery.
