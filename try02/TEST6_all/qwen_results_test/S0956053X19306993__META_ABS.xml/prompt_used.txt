You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-processing of common plastics with pistachio hulls via hydrothermal liquefaction Mixed, wet, plastic streams containing food waste residues are being increasingly collected at point of use, but are extremely challenging to recycle and are therefore largely sent to landfill. While a challenging waste problem, this also represents an underutilised feedstock, which could be co-processed with biomass, increasing the scope of products, easing out seasonal variation in biomass production and increasing the production capacity of a traditional biorefinery. One promising method of biomass conversion is hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), where lignocellulosic residues are broken down in water at high temperatures and pressures to produce a bio-crude oil, a solid residue and an aqueous fertiliser. In this study, the co-processing of common plastic waste with pistachio hulls was assessed to investigate the suitability of the HTL approach. The HTL of pistachio hulls was undertaken at 350 °C over 15 and 60 min, with four commonly used plastics: polyethylene, polypropylene, PET and nylon-6, in blends of up to 20 wt% plastic to biomass. A novel FT-IR method was developed to estimate the conversion of plastics in the system, and the product phases were fully analysed. High yields of up to 35% bio-crude were achieved, and under optimal conditions, nylon-6 and PET were found to break down almost completely in the system. PET generated numerous products that distributed predominantly into the aqueous phase; the major decomposition product of nylon-6 was found to be the monomer ∊-caprolactam, also largely partitioning into the aqueous phase. The polyolefins were less reactive; a limited degree of decomposition formed oxidised products, which distributed into the bio-crude phase. This result represents a highly promising method for waste plastic valorisation.
