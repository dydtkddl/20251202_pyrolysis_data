You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Distribution, migration, and removal of N-containing products during polyurethane pyrolysis: A review Due to the wide applications of polyurethane (PU), production is constantly increasing, accounting for 8% of produced plastics. PU has been regarded as the 6th most used polymer in the world. Improper disposal of waste PU will result in serious environmental consequences. The pyrolysis of polymers is one of the most commonly used disposal methods, but PU pyrolysis easily produces toxic and harmful nitrogen-containing substances due to its high nitrogen content. This paper reviews the decomposition pathways, kinetic characteristics, and migration of N-element by product distribution during PU pyrolysis. PU ester bonds break to produce isocyanates and alcohols or decarboxylate to produce primary amines, which are then further decomposed to MDI, MAI, and MDA. The nitrogenous products, including NH3, HCN, and benzene derivatives, are released by the breakage of C-C and C-N bonds. The N-element migration mechanism is concluded. Meanwhile, this paper reviews the removal of gaseous pollution from PU pyrolysis and discusses the removal mechanism in depth. Among the catalysts for pollutant removal, CaO has the most superior catalytic performance and can convert fuel-N to N2 by adsorption and dehydrogenation reactions. At the end of the review, new challenges for the utilization and high-quality recycling of PU are presented
