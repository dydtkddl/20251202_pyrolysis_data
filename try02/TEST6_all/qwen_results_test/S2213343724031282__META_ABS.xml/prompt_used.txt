You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Magnetic biochar generated from oil-mill wastewater by microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment for sonocatalytic antibiotic degradation The pollution risks of biomass-containing and antibiotics-containing wastewater mean that it must be treated before discharge into the environment. In a process following circular economy principles, oil-mill wastewater (OMWW) was treated in a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process and with simultaneously fabricated magnetic biochar (MBC), which was used as a catalyst for the sonocatalytic degradation of antibiotics metronidazole (MET) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) in aqueous solutions. FeCl3·6H2O, FeCl2·4H2O, and KOH were added to the OMWW, which was then treated in a SynthWave microwave reactor under either a nitrogen or air atmosphere. The UV254 and COD removal efficiencies of the OMWW reached 42.3% and 60.6%, respectively, after treatment at 250 °C for 3 h. The MBC obtained from the OMWW treatment with air exhibited the highest adsorption and catalytic activity for antibiotics degradation. The synergistic effects of combining adsorption and sonolytic removal were in the ranges of 0.76–3.07 (MET) and 0.75–3.17 (CIP), resulting in significant degradation rate constants of pseudo-first-order kinetics (k 1) that ranged from 0.010 to 0.086 min−1 (MET) and from 0.018 to 0.050 min−1 (CIP). Hydrophobic MET underwent faster degradation than hydrophilic CIP. The •OH is crucial for removing the model antibiotics. Initial antibiotics concentration, reaction volume, ultrasonic frequency, and power had clearer impacts on antibiotics degradation than bulk temperature. Furthermore, the possible sonocatalytic degradation pathways have also been proposed herein. The absorbents and catalysts were derived during the purification of OMWW and subsequently used for antibiotics removal from water, becoming an innovative case of circular economy and sustainable waste treatment.
