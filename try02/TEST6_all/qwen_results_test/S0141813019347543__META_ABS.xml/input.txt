Generalized kinetics for thermal degradation and melt rheology for poly (lactic acid)/poly (butylene succinate)/functionalized chitosan based reactive nanobiocomposite Systematic kinetics of melt-blended Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and PLA/PBS/functionalized chitosan (FCH) nanobiocomposites with dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and chemical changes thereof at degradation temperatures are evaluated using thermogravimetry (TGA) and thermogravimetry coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TGA–FTIR). A comprehensive kinetic model is employed on above blended samples, including (i) Flynn–Wall–Ozawa, Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose methods to investigate the kinetic and thermodynamic variables, and (ii) Generalized master plots to propose the thermal-induced mechanism. The thermal stability of PLA/PBS reduced with increasing FCH loading up to 3 wt%, and improved for DCP treated PLA/PBS/1FCH at maximum degradation temperature (Tmax) is noticed. The activation energy estimated from Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method are (129–139 kJmol−1), (116–152 kJmol−1), (109–146 kJmol−1), (132–169 kJmol−1) and (120–166 kJmol−1) for PLA/PBS, PLA/PBS/1FCH, PLA/PBS/3FCH, PLA/PBS/1DFCH and PLA/PBS/3DFCH respectively. The generalized master plots depicts that the PLA/PBS blend exhibited L2–F1 mechanism whereas their nanobiocomposite with or without DCP followed L2–Dn and A2–L2–Dn mechanism respectively. Coupled TGA–FTIR highlights the similar kinds of products such as lactide, acetaldehyde, esters, CO2 and CO liberated during the thermal degradation of PLA/PBS blend and their nanobiocomposites. These crosslinked/branched structures are postulated by the rheological behavior which confirmed increase in the complex viscosity (η*) and storage modulus (G′) of PLA/PBS/D/1FCH.
