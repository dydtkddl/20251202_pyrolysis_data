Assessment of energy consumption and environmental safety measures in a plasma pyrolysis plant for eco-friendly waste treatment A plasma pyrolysis plant with a 50 kg/h installed capacity is investigated for its performance in terms of energy consumption, carbon emission, and environmental safety. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), precisely the combustible fraction, is processed at approximately 1000 °C. A temperature shoot study is conducted to reduce the energy required for waste processing, revealing a total energy consumption of 0.586 kWh per kg of waste, leading to a reduction of ∼15%. A mass and energy balance has been done to get a clear understanding of different products, by-product generation, and heat losses during waste treatment. The gas analysis identified CO and H2 as dominant components, comprising around 30% of the produced gases, with a lower heating value (LHV) of 4.7 MJ/Nm3. The cold gas efficiency ranges from 44 to 53%. The Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) techniques characterize the ash generated during the process and are found carbonless and non-toxic in nature. The wastewater produced during gas cleaning exhibited a neutral acidic nature, with total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 1200 to 1500 mg/l. These findings contribute to the plant's promising role in sustainable waste management practices, highlighting its potential as an environmentally sound solution for processing waste.
