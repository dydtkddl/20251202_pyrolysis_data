You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of energy consumption and environmental safety measures in a plasma pyrolysis plant for eco-friendly waste treatment A plasma pyrolysis plant with a 50 kg/h installed capacity is investigated for its performance in terms of energy consumption, carbon emission, and environmental safety. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), precisely the combustible fraction, is processed at approximately 1000 °C. A temperature shoot study is conducted to reduce the energy required for waste processing, revealing a total energy consumption of 0.586 kWh per kg of waste, leading to a reduction of ∼15%. A mass and energy balance has been done to get a clear understanding of different products, by-product generation, and heat losses during waste treatment. The gas analysis identified CO and H2 as dominant components, comprising around 30% of the produced gases, with a lower heating value (LHV) of 4.7 MJ/Nm3. The cold gas efficiency ranges from 44 to 53%. The Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) techniques characterize the ash generated during the process and are found carbonless and non-toxic in nature. The wastewater produced during gas cleaning exhibited a neutral acidic nature, with total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 1200 to 1500 mg/l. These findings contribute to the plant's promising role in sustainable waste management practices, highlighting its potential as an environmentally sound solution for processing waste.
