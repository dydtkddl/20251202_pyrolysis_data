You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Toluene-insoluble fraction from thermal cracking of Athabasca gas oil: formation of a liquid-in-oil emulsion that wets hydrophobic dispersed solids The formation of a toluene-insoluble (TI) fraction and its interaction with fine solids was studied by heating coker gas oil from Athabasca bitumen in a stirred batch reactor at 300–420°C and a total pressure of 13MPa (from an initial hydrogen pressure of 7MPa before heating) for 1h. The TI solids were filtered from the product oil and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, and elemental analysis. The micrographs indicated that the TI fraction formed a liquid-in-oil emulsion at reactor conditions, consisting of spheres of TI material suspended in gas oil. The spheres were soluble in quinoline, and therefore were not mesophase coke. The TI spheres gave very little physical interaction with 5μm kaolin particles, but the addition of particles with non-polar surface groups (carbon black and asphaltene-coated clay) suppressed the formation of spheres. The addition of solid particles did not affect the total yield of TI significantly, based on carbon and sulfur analysis. These results suggested that the liquid TI fraction wetted and spread on non-polar surfaces, but not on polar surfaces.
