Thermal decomposition and product distribution of phytoremediation residues contaminated by different heavy metals: experiments and reactive force field simulations Understanding the influence of heavy metals in phytoremediation residue on pyrolysis is critical for targeted resource utilization. We cultivated Emarginate Stonecrop L. (ES) contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Zn (denoted as MB) and investigated the effect of heavy metal pollution on pyrolysis characteristics and product distribution through experimental and simulation methods. The MB produced more biochar and pyrolysis gas at the expense of pyrolysis oil compared to clean ES (CB). TG and kinetic analyses revealed that the three MB samples exhibited lower decomposition rates and consistently lower overall reaction rate constants than CB. TG-MS and Py-GCMS analyses identified higher H2, CH4, CO2, and H2O levels in the pyrolysis gas of the three MBs compared to CB, while CO production was inhibited. The proportion of acids in pyrolysis oil was notably lower in MBs compared to CB, whereas hydrocarbons and carbonyls increased. Furthermore, the specific surface area and pore volume of biochar derived from Cd- and Zn-polluted ES were higher than those from CB, with Pb showing minimal effect. Additionally, reactive force field simulations revealed that Zn/ZnO can promote bond-breaking in cellulose by binding to oxygen atoms, facilitating the migration of OH/H, subsequently forming water molecules or redistributing them to other small molecules/free radicals, thereby altering the cellulose bond-breaking pathway.
