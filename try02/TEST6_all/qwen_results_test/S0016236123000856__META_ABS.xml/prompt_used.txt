You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical conversion of different biomass feedstocks into hydrogen for power plant electricity generation Most hydrogen production technologies are dependent on non-renewable resources, which are not sustainable in the long run. However, H2 can be produced in the future from renewable sources, becoming one of the cleanest energy carriers. Compared to other biomass treatment methods, the thermochemical pathways from biomass for sustainable H2 generation offers a considerable promise for its industrial use. The most studied routes are biomass gasification and reformation of the bio-oil generated by biomass pyrolysis, while some works on supercritical water gasification and bio-oil gasification are extensively developed to improve hydorgen production efficiency. This review discusses the most current developments in research on the methods of pyrolysis, gasification, steam reformation, and microwave-induced plasma for producing hydrogen from various types of biomasses, including lignocellulosic and woody biomasses. By utilizing the hydrogen produced from biomass, possibilities of creating a sustainable city were analyzed. There are many upgraded technologies to generate electricity using hydrogen produced from biomass such as gas turbines, combined cycle power plants, and fuel cells. The environmental feasibility of hydrogen usage was also evaluated, along with the status quo of hydrogen power plants in several countries. This review contributes to the large-scale implementation of hydrogen energy with in-depth discussion on the latest development.
