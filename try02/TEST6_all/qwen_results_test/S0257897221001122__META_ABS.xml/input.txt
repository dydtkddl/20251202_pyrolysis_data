Adhesion, structure, and mechanical properties of Cr HiPIMS and cathodic arc deposited coatings on SiC Chromium deposited by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) versus cathodic arc (CA) processes exhibits very different mechanical properties. Combining the two can result in a single-phase with superior performance that can be tailored for use in coating SiC for advanced nuclear fuel cladding. Coating morphology, residual stress, elemental depth profiles, and mechanical testing by scratch, pull-off adhesion, and microcantilevers are shown for HiPIMS, CA, and combined coatings. CA coatings were likely to spall and had lower adhesion strength due to tensile residual stresses but had desirable material properties. By depositing an initial layer of Cr by HiPIMS followed by a layer of Cr by CA, a more adherent coating was achieved and some of the stress issues with CA morphology were resolved. Combined coatings withstood at least 80 MPa in pull-off adhesion tests and had maximum failure stress values of 5GPa in microcantilever tests. These results were better than either individual deposition method and point to a hybrid approach being a path forward for a more robust coating.
