You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An approach for upgrading bio-oil by using heavy bio-oil co-pyrolyzed with bamboo leached with light bio-oil The quality of bio-oil produced by conventional pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks is relatively low. In particular, the bio-oil phase separates into light bio-oil (LB) and heavy bio-oil (HB) that are difficult to use. In this study, light bio-oil was used to leach bamboo to remove ash and alkali metals, and then the leached bamboo was co-pyrolyzed with HB. The response surface methodology was used to evaluate the influences of the different experimental conditions (temperature, residence time, and mass ratio) on the properties of the resulting bio-oil. The results highlight that the mass yield and quality of bio-oil produced with HB and bamboo were improved compared to bio-oil produced with only bamboo alone. Under the optimal co-pyrolysis conditions using an HB/raw bamboo mass ratio of 4:1, 640 °C and 25 min, the highest yield of 61.84% was obtained, and the bio-oil had the lowest water content (15.78%) and a higher heating value (HHV) of 27.75 MJ/kg. The yield and HHV were further increased in the bio-oil prepared by co-pyrolysis of HB and bamboo pretreated by the LB leaching process. Moreover, the relative contents of phenols and hydrocarbons in the bio-oil increased, while that of acids decreased because of the synergistic effects of the combined raw materials on the bio-oils produced by co-pyrolysis. Finally, predictive models for the bio-oil yield and properties were established and gave a foundation for the preparation and utilization of bio-oils.
