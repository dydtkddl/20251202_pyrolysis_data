You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced oxidation processes in microreactors for water and wastewater treatment: Development, challenges, and opportunities The miniaturization of reaction processes by microreactors offers many significant advantages over the use of larger, conventional reactors. Microreactors’ interior structures exhibit comparatively higher surface area-to-volume ratios, which reduce reactant diffusion distances, enable faster and more efficient heat and mass transfer, and better control over process conditions. These advantages can be exploited to significantly enhance the performance of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) commonly used for the removal of water pollutants. This comprehensive review of the rapidly emerging area of environmental microfluidics describes recent advances in the development and application of microreactors to AOPs for water and wastewater treatment. Consideration is given to the hydrodynamic properties, construction materials, fabrication techniques, designs, process features, and upscaling of microreactors used for AOPs. The use of microreactors for various AOP types, including photocatalytic, electrochemical, Fenton, ozonation, and plasma-phase processes, showcases how microfluidic technology enhances mass transfer, improves treatment efficiency, and decreases the consumption of energy and chemicals. Despite significant advancements of microreactor technology, organic pollutant degradation mechanisms that operate during microscale AOPs remain poorly understood. Moreover, limited throughput capacity of microreactor systems significantly restrains their industrial-scale applicability. Since large microreactor-inspired AOP systems are needed to meet the high-throughput requirements of the water treatment sector, scale-up strategies and recommendations are suggested as priority research opportunities. While microstructured reactor technology remains in an early stage of development, this work offers valuable insight for future research and development of AOPs in microreactors for environmental purposes.
