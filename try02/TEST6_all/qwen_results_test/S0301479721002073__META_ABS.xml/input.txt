Upgrading from batch to continuous flow process for the pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse: Structural characterization of the biochars produced The waste from agriculture can be used for biochar production by the pyrolysis process. The present work aimed was to produce sugarcane bagasse biochars using different temperatures and processes (batch and pilot-scale continuous flow). The samples were characterized by FTIR, functional group pKa, elemental analysis, zeta potential, Raman spectroscopy, EPR, and SEM. The FTIR spectra showed bands around 1400-1650 cm−1 corresponded to vibrations of CC bonds and pKa revealed the presence of carboxylic acids (pKa ≤5) and lactones (pKa ~5–9). The elemental analyses (H/C ~ 0.31) and Raman spectra (ID/IG ~ 0.55) confirmed greater carbonization and less structural disorder of the material produced using the continuous flow process. SEM images showed that the biochar morphologies were similar to that of the precursor biomass, with the formation of pores. The continuous flow process is a promising technique for the production of biochars with high carbon contents and aromatic structures, as well as lower defect degrees, compared to biochars produced using a batch process.
