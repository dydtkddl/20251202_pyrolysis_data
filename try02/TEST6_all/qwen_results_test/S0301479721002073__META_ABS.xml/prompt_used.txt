You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading from batch to continuous flow process for the pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse: Structural characterization of the biochars produced The waste from agriculture can be used for biochar production by the pyrolysis process. The present work aimed was to produce sugarcane bagasse biochars using different temperatures and processes (batch and pilot-scale continuous flow). The samples were characterized by FTIR, functional group pKa, elemental analysis, zeta potential, Raman spectroscopy, EPR, and SEM. The FTIR spectra showed bands around 1400-1650 cm−1 corresponded to vibrations of CC bonds and pKa revealed the presence of carboxylic acids (pKa ≤5) and lactones (pKa ~5–9). The elemental analyses (H/C ~ 0.31) and Raman spectra (ID/IG ~ 0.55) confirmed greater carbonization and less structural disorder of the material produced using the continuous flow process. SEM images showed that the biochar morphologies were similar to that of the precursor biomass, with the formation of pores. The continuous flow process is a promising technique for the production of biochars with high carbon contents and aromatic structures, as well as lower defect degrees, compared to biochars produced using a batch process.
