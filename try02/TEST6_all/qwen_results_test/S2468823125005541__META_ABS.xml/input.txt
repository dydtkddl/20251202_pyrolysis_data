Catalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste into nitrogen-containing chemicals The production of high-value nitrogen-containing chemicals from biomass and plastic waste has attracted growing attention. Chemocatalytic methods have emerged as efficient strategies for converting these feedstocks into valuable compounds. This review focuses on the catalytic synthesis of three major classes of nitrogen-containing chemicals—amino acids, amines, and N-heterocycles—via thermocatalytic, photocatalytic, and electrocatalytic methods. Specifically, it discusses the conversion of α‑hydroxy acids, glycerol, and waste polylactic acid into amino acids; the transformation of furfural into amines; and the synthesis of N-heterocycles from levulinic acid, furfural, and glucose. By systematically comparing different catalytic systems, this review provides a comprehensive evaluation of their efficiencies, challenges, and industrial applicability, offering valuable insights to support the development of sustainable nitrogen functionalization strategies for biomass and plastic waste valorization.
