You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Machine learning-driven modeling framework for steam co-gasification applications Steam co-gasification of biomass and plastic waste is a promising route for syngas production and waste valorization. However, accurately predicting syngas composition remains challenging due to inherent complexity and nonlinearity of the process. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis between conventional process simulators-based models (Aspen Plus), namely the thermodynamic equilibrium (TEM), restricted thermodynamic (RTM), and kinetic (KM) modeling approaches, and machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of the syngas composition. Using 208 experimental data points compiled from 20 published studies covering various feedstocks and gasification conditions in bubbling fluidized bed gasifiers (BFBG), the performance of the models was evaluated after extensive data preprocessing. Among several ML algorithms evaluated, the neural network (NN) delivered the lowest average root mean square error in syngas mol fraction predictions (0.0174), outperforming RTM (0.0966), KM (0.1378), and TEM (0.1470). To explore input–output relationships beyond interpolation, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) generated synthetic data, which served as the basis for sensitivity and interpretability analyses. The NN, acting as a surrogate model, was paired with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to quantify the effects and nonlinear interactions of key features on syngas yields providing actionable insights for process optimization.
