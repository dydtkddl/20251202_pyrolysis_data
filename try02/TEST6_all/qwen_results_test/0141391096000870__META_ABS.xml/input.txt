Thermal degradation of mixed plastic waste to aromatics and gas A poly(vinylchloride) (PVC)-poor light fraction separated from mixed plastic waste (MPW) collected from German households by DSD was pyrolyzed in a technical scale fluidized bed reactor to yield aromatic oils and heat-providing gas. The most important target products were benzene, toluene, xylenes and styrene with a total yield of 31.4% by weight (referring to the total organic input). Additionally, pyrolysis gas with a high calorific value of 50 MJ/kg was obtained. Problematic pollutants, such as chloro-organic compounds and heavy metals, were absent or immobilized during the pyrolysis reaction in a matrix of carbon black.
