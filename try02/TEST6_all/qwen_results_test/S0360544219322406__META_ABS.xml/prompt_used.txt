You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and waste high-density polyethylene: Synergistic effect and product distributions Co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) with waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was performed in a fixed-bed reactor under different temperatures (400–700 °C) and blending ratios (0–100%). Product yields and chemical compositions were compared with those from the pyrolysis of individual components to ascertain the synergistic effect between SCB and HDPE. The synergistic effect of SCB and HDPE produced higher liquid yield than the theoretical value. The effect was strongest at 600 °C and 60:40 HDPE:SCB ratio, with the maximum difference of 6.02 wt%. The positive synergistic effects on the production of high-value organic compounds (alcohol, hydrocarbons, and aromatics) and inhibition of oxygenated compounds were most prominent at 600 °C and 40:60 HDPE:SCB ratio. SCB-derived hydroxyl radicals favored the secondary cracking of HDPE primary volatiles, thereby promoting the formation of aliphatic compounds with lower carbon numbers. Co-pyrolysis of SCB and HDPE also produced oil with higher carbon (34% higher) and hydrogen (47% higher) contents, and with lower oxygen content (70% lower) than those of SCB pyrolysis oil. It also achieved a high calorific value of 42.41 MJ/kg, which is comparable to those of commercial diesel fuels.
