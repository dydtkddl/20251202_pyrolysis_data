You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tandem pyrolysis evolved gas–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry Analysis of byproducts from thermal degradation of polymer materials provides a wealth of information about a materials’ composition, thermal stability, degradation mechanisms, and kinetics. However, regardless of the instrumentation used, only limited information is obtainable from a single experiment. Microfurnace technology, when interfaced to a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), can be used to obtain both thermal and chemical information via evolved gas analysis-MS (EGA-MS) and GC-MS analysis modes. While both EGA-MS and Py-GC-MS are valuable when characterizing polymer materials, at least two experiments on distinct samples are required, which can be a liability for clear interpretation of results from inhomogeneous samples. Here, we seek to overcome this limitation by combining EGA-MS and Py-GC-MS modes in a single experimental setup. This was done by developing new gas line modifications to allow for tandem Pyrolysis Evolved Gas-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (Py/EG-GC-MS) analysis. Verification of Py/EG-GC-MS analysis was performed using a polystyrene standard. Results demonstrate successful Py/EG-GC-MS analysis for the first-time showing the potential of these modifications for application in areas where sample is limited or direct correlation of products to the thermal profile is desirable such as in forensics or product-specific kinetics.
