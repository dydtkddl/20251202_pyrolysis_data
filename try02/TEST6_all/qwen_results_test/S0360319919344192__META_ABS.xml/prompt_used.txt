You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal co-gasification of sorghum biomass and çan lignite in mild conditions: An optimization study for high yield hydrogen production In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) combined with a 3–factor and 3–level Box–Behnken design (BBD) was performed to obtain high yield hydrogen production from hydrothermal co–gasification of sorghum biomass and low rank Çan lignite in a batch type reactor at 500 °C. The individual and the combined effects of the process parameters of coal amount (%) of the coal/biomass mixtures, initial water volume (mL) of the reactor and amount of the coal/biomass mixtures (kg) on system pressure, total gas yield, hydrogen production and product distribution were determined. Water volume directly affected the system pressure and the reaction medium was supercritical water medium above 48.2 mL with a pressure of 22.06 MPa. The highest values of both total gas volume and hydrogen gas volume were reached by gasification of 5.0 g of feedstock. It has been observed that total gas volume and hydrogen volume were directly affected by the water volume in the reactor and the coal ratio of the coal-biomass mixtures. The highest total gas and hydrogen volumes can be achieved under the conditions where the higher levels of water volume of the reactor and lower levels of coal percentage of the coal/biomass mixture were combined. Optimum conditions for maximum hydrogen production with 5.0 g of coal/biomass mixture were determined with numerical optimization as coal percentage of 25.6% and initial water volume of 68.5 mL. By combining the impregnated K2CO3 (3%, (w/w)) and CaO catalysts an excellent hydrogen selectivity was achieved. The hydrogen selectivity was drastically increased from 32.0% to 70.8% by capturing more than 99% of CO2 with a H2/CO2 mol ratio of 88.5.
