MgO-ZrO2 mixed nanocomposites: fabrication methods and applications In recent years, MgO-ZrO2 composite has made a versatile progress in its applications because of its outstanding resistance to temperature and corrosion. It was found to have high melting point and dominant mechanical properties for industrial applications such as manufacturing high temperature nozzles, thermal barrier coatings for gas turbine blades, etc. In this article, the properties of both metal oxides such as MgO and ZrO2 were assessed, followed by preparation methods for the fabrication of MgO-ZrO2 nanocomposite by sol-gel, plasma spray, co-precipitation, hydrothermal method, etc were conferred, and its different characterization techniques depicted the crystallite size and the particle size in the range of 25–60 nm, and the surface area of MgO-ZrO2 nanocomposite was in the range of 9–60 m2/g. Among all the phases of zirconia, tetragonal and cubic phases–stabilized zirconia showed enormous applications in protective coating, catalysis, fuel-cell technology, etc. In addition to that, novel MgO-ZrO2 composite has led to various applications in photocatalysis, synthesis of organic compounds, dye removal, etc. This review has mainly focused on the applications and identifying the benefits of MgO-ZrO2 nanocomposites in various fields, and it has shown potential applications such as solid oxide fuel cell, gas sensors, ceramic applications, remarkable biocompatibility, etc.
