You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of synthetic polymers and plastic wastes. Kinetic study Thermal decomposition of natural polystyrene, recycled plastics, low density polyethylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyenterophthalate of ethylene, and polypropylene has been carried out. Both isothermal and dynamic experiments at different heating rates have been performed in a thermobalance with the objective of determining the kinetic parameters. Also, a first set of experiments, performed in a cylindrical stainless-steel atmospheric pressure reactor, was designed to evaluate the products of the pyrolysis process. The effects of N2 flow rate (200–300 cm3 min−1), initial mass fed to the reactor (15–75 mg), temperature (415–490 °C), and heating rate (5–30 K min−1) were studied. By application of a first order kinetic model, the activation energy for every plastic has been determined. The values of activation energy in isothermic and dynamic regimen are the following: natural polystyrene: 136, and 168 to 286 kJ/mol. Recycled plastic: 250, and 150 to 290 kJ/mol. Low density polyethylene: 285, and 220 to 259 kJ/mol. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene: 118, and 104 to 251 kJ/mol. Polyenterophthalate of ethylene: 161, and 117 to 255 kJ/mol. Polypropylene: 169, and 153 to 265 kJ/mol.
