Upcycling of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics via electrocatalysis Electrocatalysis offers efficient and targeted conversion of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics to chemical products under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. This review provides analysis of research on electrochemical upgrading of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics published from 2021 to present. Factors for assessing upgrading of waste polyester plastics include alkaline hydrolysis pretreatment, indices of electrochemical reaction process (activity, stability, and techno-economic analysis), separation, and product recovery. Types of depolymerization monomers and their value-added products are summarized along with electrocatalytic mechanisms and reaction pathways. Notably, cathode coupled reactions offer significant value for anodic waste plastic oxidation during electrolysis processes. Development of bifunctional electrocatalysts can reduce the cost of coupled systems and complexity of the electrolyzer. Upgrading and recycling of waste plastic monomers using electrocatalytic technology should undergo downstream processing to form high-value products containing C–N and C–S derived functional groups obtained from depolymerized monomers. Electrochemical conversion and upgrading of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics can contribute to industrialization and global economies and help to realize environmental sustainability.
