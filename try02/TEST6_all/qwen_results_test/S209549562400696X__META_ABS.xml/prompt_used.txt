You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics via electrocatalysis Electrocatalysis offers efficient and targeted conversion of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics to chemical products under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. This review provides analysis of research on electrochemical upgrading of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics published from 2021 to present. Factors for assessing upgrading of waste polyester plastics include alkaline hydrolysis pretreatment, indices of electrochemical reaction process (activity, stability, and techno-economic analysis), separation, and product recovery. Types of depolymerization monomers and their value-added products are summarized along with electrocatalytic mechanisms and reaction pathways. Notably, cathode coupled reactions offer significant value for anodic waste plastic oxidation during electrolysis processes. Development of bifunctional electrocatalysts can reduce the cost of coupled systems and complexity of the electrolyzer. Upgrading and recycling of waste plastic monomers using electrocatalytic technology should undergo downstream processing to form high-value products containing C–N and C–S derived functional groups obtained from depolymerized monomers. Electrochemical conversion and upgrading of monomers derived from waste polyester plastics can contribute to industrialization and global economies and help to realize environmental sustainability.
