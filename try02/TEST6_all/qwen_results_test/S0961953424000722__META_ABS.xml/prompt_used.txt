You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic interventions in bio-oil production from lignocellulosic biomass and Co-processing with petroleum refinery fractions: A review The global demand for alternative renewable fuels and chemicals has fascinated researchers to look out for bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass. The unmediated usage of bio-oil is restricted due to its undesirable qualities, including high oxygen content, high corrosivity, and low thermal stability. To enhance the properties of bio-oil, catalytic intervention is very much needed during pyrolysis or liquefaction. In addition, building a grassroot refinery for bio-oil processing is economically not viable. In the existing petroleum refineries, several valuable products (olefins, aromatics, LPG, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel) are being produced from low-value feedstock (crude oil, vacuum gas oil, and vacuum residue) to improve the economics. An alternative approach is proposed to co-process bio-oil with petroleum refinery fractions in the existing petroleum refineries. Lignocellulosic biomass is available in vast quantity globally so this approach might act as a substitute to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels in a sustainable way. Co-processing can be achieved by understanding the conversion processes and their mechanistic pathways. This study reviews the available literature on different thermochemical conversions, namely, fast pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, hydrothermal/solvothermal liquefaction, and hydrodeoxygenated bio-oil and co-processing of this bio-oil through fluid catalytic cracking and hydrotreating. Co-processing challenges and research gaps have also been indicated for future exploration.
