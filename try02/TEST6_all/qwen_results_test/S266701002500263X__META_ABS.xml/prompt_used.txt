You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the synergy of fast co-pyrolysis of spent coffee ground and disposed urban facemask: analysis of kinetics and product compositions This study investigates the thermo-kinetic behavior and product distribution during the co-pyrolysis of spent coffee grounds (SCG) and facemasks (FM). TGA was employed to evaluate the kinetics and thermodynamics of the pyrolysis process by segmenting the thermal decomposition into stage I (200 – 360 °C) and stage II (360 – 550 °C), while Py-GC/MS was used to analyse the product composition. SCG and FM blends with varying ratios by wt.% (SCG:FM = 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:100, and 0:100) were subjected to pyrolysis at four heating rates (5, 10, and 30 °C/min). The decomposition curves were deconvoluted using Fraser-Suzuki deconvolution method into four peaks related to biomass pseudo-components and FM degradation. The deconvoluted curves showed potential synergistic interaction at the lignin and FM decomposition zone (460 – 500 °C). The kinetic analyses were carried out using three model-free methods to investigate the activation energy (Ea) and thermodynamics of co-pyrolysis. The lowest Ea value was obtained at SCG25 %FM%75 % (305.1 – 239 kJ/mol), mostly pronounced in stage II. Py-GC/MS analysis of the co-pyrolysis products demonstrates that the decomposition of polypropylene polymer of the FM promoted the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons and reduces the overall acidity. This effect was further amplified at higher pyrolysis temperatures (450 – 650 °C). The blending ratio also plays a significant role, with a higher polymer content (SCG25 %FM75 %) leading to a more aliphatic products and a significant decline in carboxylic acids and anhydro-sugars. Moreover, co-pyrolysis reduced the N containing compounds significantly. Finally, policy implications and recommendations for co-pyrolysis adoption were incorporated. Overall, this study highlights the potential of utilizing waste material like SCG and FM for the sustainable production of valuable chemicals and fuels.
