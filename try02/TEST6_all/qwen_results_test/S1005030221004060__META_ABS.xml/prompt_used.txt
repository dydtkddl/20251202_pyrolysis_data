You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermally insulating robust carbon composite foams with high EMI shielding from natural cotton Thermally insulating and fire-resistant carbon composite foams are prepared by consolidating natural cotton fibre dispersed in aqueous sucrose solution by filter-pressing followed by drying and carbonization. The compressive strength (5 kPa to 1.4 MPa) and thermal conductivity (0.069 to 0.185 W m − 1 K − 1) depend on the foam density (0.06 to 0.31 g cm−3) which is modulated by varying the sucrose solutions concentration (100 to 700 g L − 1). Partially flexible to the rigid transition of the carbon composite foams occurs at sucrose concentration above 200 g L − 1. The tubular carbon fibre formed from cotton is welded at their contact points by the amorphous carbon produced from sucrose leading to partial flexibility at low sucrose concentration and advancement of fibre- to- fibre bonding area at higher sucrose concentration results in rigid foam. The porosity in the inter-fibre space and lumen of the carbonized cotton fibre contributes to the low thermal conductivity. The carbon composite foams prepared at a sucrose solution concentration of 500 g L − 1 and above are amenable to machining using conventional machines and tools. The rigid carbon foams show EMI shielding effectiveness and specific shielding effectiveness in the ranges of 21.5 to 38.9 dB and 108–138 dB cm3 g − 1, respectively.
