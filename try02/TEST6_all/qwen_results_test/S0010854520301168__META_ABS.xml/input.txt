Precursors for chemical vapor deposition of tungsten oxide and molybdenum oxide Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a deposition technique capable of depositing a thin layer of material through the gas-phase decomposition of precursor molecules. In addition to the deposition parameters, the choice of precursor is crucial in determining the stoichiometry, composition and properties of the films. The established library of CVD precursors for tungsten and molybdenum oxides has been extended well beyond the originally studied simple inorganic precursors to also include organometallic, metal–organic and metal salt precursors. Herein, we highlight the progress in precursor development for both metal oxides.
