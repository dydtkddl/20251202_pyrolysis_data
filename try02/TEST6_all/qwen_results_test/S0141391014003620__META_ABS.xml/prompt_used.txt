You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Decomposition mechanism of fire retarded ethylene vinyl acetate elastomer (EVA) containing aluminum trihydroxide and melamine The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of aluminum trihydroxide (ATH) and melamine (MEL) mixture on the flame retardant and smoke release properties of ethylene vinyl acetate (vinyl acetate content of 60 wt%, EVA). The fire retardant properties were evaluated by mass loss calorimetry (MLC), limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL-94. A home-made smoke test was developed to evaluate the smoke release of the material in a given scenario. It was found that the addition of ATH to EVA leads to improved fire retardant properties and reduced smoke release. Partial substitution of ATH by MEL at different ratios resulted in better results in MLC for a ratio of ATH:MEL of 5:1 and 10:1. Moreover, a lower quantity of smoke was released for EVA–ATH–MEL materials during material decomposition. A ratio of ATH:MEL of 5:1 was found to be the most promising. It was also shown that EVA–ATH–MEL ignited at shorter time in MLC test but longer ignition time in smoke test in comparison to EVA–ATH which is due to different test conditions. To understand the role of melamine on material properties, the degradation pathway of EVA–ATH–MEL was analyzed in details. The dispersion of the additives was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showing that all additives are homogenously dispersed in the matrix. In the next step the pyrolytic decomposition was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (py-GCMS). The decomposition of EVA–ATH–MEL was then analyzed in the gas phase using MLC coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (MLC–FTIR) and in the condensed phase using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 13C and 27Al. It was concluded that the additives protected the EVA both by a gas and condensed phase mechanism. The endothermic decomposition of ATH has a cooling effect and dilutes the fuel through release of water in the gas phase. Moreover, in the condensed phase, EVA–ATH–MEL is protected through formation of a char acting as barrier slowing down heat and mass transfer compared to EVA–ATH. Ignition at shorter times of EVA–ATH–MEL in comparison to EVA–ATH was found to be due to higher amount of flammable gases in the gas phase before ignition.
