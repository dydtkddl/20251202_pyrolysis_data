Process-scale disruption of microorganisms Common hosts for the large-scale manufacture of biological products, such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, do not excrete products to the medium. Effective techniques for cell disruption are therefore required. These include physical, chemical, enzymatic and mechanical methods. Mechanical methods such as bead milling, high-pressure homogenization, and microfluidization are preferred. However, gentler, specific methods are receiving increasing attention particularly when used in combination to synergistically exploit their different specificities. Benefits can also be derived by integrating product release and recovery. In all cases it is essential to consider the interaction of the disruption operation with downstream units and to clearly demonstrate the cost benefits of alternative strategies.
