You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A recent development of low-cost membranes for microbial fuel cell applications The need for determining new or alternate technology for power generation is rising due to the depletion of fossil fuels. Moreover, the usage of fossil fuels leads to environmental damage. Hence to minimize it, the demand for green technologies is rising. Microbial Fuel cell (MFC) helps in the production of electricity in a greener way and minimizes the pollution load. MFC produces electricity by degrading organic matter using microorganisms in anaerobic conditions. The waste load or wastewater from various sources can be treated using this method and produce electricity simultaneously. MFC usually contains a membrane for the ion exchange process. The proper functioning of this membrane determines the overall performance of MFC. Commonly used membrane Nafion has been found to have certain drawbacks including higher cost which reduces the chance of commercialization of MFC. Hence, new membranes using materials like Poly Vinyl Alcohol, Polyvinylidene fluoride, Sulfonated Poly Ether Ether Ketone, Clay, Ceramics, and Chitosan must be developed. The lower cost of these membranes with good durability and better performance may favor the commercialization of MFC. This review focuses on membranes that are low in cost and have higher performance when compared with Nafion membranes.
