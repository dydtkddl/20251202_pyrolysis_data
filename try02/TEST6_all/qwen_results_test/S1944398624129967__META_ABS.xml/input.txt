A recent development of low-cost membranes for microbial fuel cell applications The need for determining new or alternate technology for power generation is rising due to the depletion of fossil fuels. Moreover, the usage of fossil fuels leads to environmental damage. Hence to minimize it, the demand for green technologies is rising. Microbial Fuel cell (MFC) helps in the production of electricity in a greener way and minimizes the pollution load. MFC produces electricity by degrading organic matter using microorganisms in anaerobic conditions. The waste load or wastewater from various sources can be treated using this method and produce electricity simultaneously. MFC usually contains a membrane for the ion exchange process. The proper functioning of this membrane determines the overall performance of MFC. Commonly used membrane Nafion has been found to have certain drawbacks including higher cost which reduces the chance of commercialization of MFC. Hence, new membranes using materials like Poly Vinyl Alcohol, Polyvinylidene fluoride, Sulfonated Poly Ether Ether Ketone, Clay, Ceramics, and Chitosan must be developed. The lower cost of these membranes with good durability and better performance may favor the commercialization of MFC. This review focuses on membranes that are low in cost and have higher performance when compared with Nafion membranes.
