The liquid annular reactor system (LARS) for deep space exploration A new propulsion concept for high Δ V space missions, termed LARS (Liquid Annular Reactor System), uses liquid nuclear fuel elements to heat hydrogen propellant to very high temperatures (-6000 K). The molten fuel is contained in a lower-temperature solid container which rotates to stabilize and hold in the liquid layer by centripetal force. Containment of ultra high temperature molten refractories, using this method, has been experimentally demonstrated by A.V. Grosse. The specific impulse of a rocket exhausting hydrogen at 6000 K is 2000 seconds, approximately double that of solid-core nuclear rockets. A LARS-powered space probe could accomplish extra-solar missions to 550 A.U. in approximately 35 years.
