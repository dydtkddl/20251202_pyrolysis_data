You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polylactones synthesis by enzymatic ring opening polymerization in flow Polycondensation in batch is the classical way to produce polyesters. However, this method requires harsh conditions to reach high conversions and drive the equilibrium of the reaction forward. In order to produce controlled polymers in a greener way, we worked on the enzymatic ring opening polymerization (e-ROP) of lactones using the CALB lipase immobilized on porous beads (Novozym® 435) as a catalyst and 3-phenyl-1-propanol (PP) as initiator in a flow tubular reactor made of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing with i.d = 1.55 mm. In a short residence time of 214 s ε-caprolactone (CL) was fully polymerized (conv = 100 %) with a fair dispersity (Đ = 1.30). Polymerization of δ-valerolactone (VL) (conv = 93 %, Đ = 1.27) as well as copolymerization of CL and VL mixtures (conv up to 88 %, Đ = 1.24) behaved similarly. By alternating the lactones, a block-polymer was obtained. As expected, primary alcohols were more efficient than secondary ones for initiating the e-ROP of lactones. Very interestingly, using cholesterol as initiator induced the formation of cyclic polylactones only. In addition, we showed the importance of the residence time as at a long time the formed polymer was depolymerized by the enzyme. We demonstrated also that the enzyme may be reused more than ten times with maintaining its high efficiency. The whole study shows that the use of tubular reactor for performing e-ROP improves its control as shown by the low Đ values and decreases the residence time needed to reach high conversions compared to similar reactions in batch.
