You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling the radical to nonradical pathway transformation in peroxymonosulfate activation by Zn hyperaccumulator-derived biochar pyrolyzed at different temperatures The efficient utilization of intrinsic elements is crucial for the functionalization of heavy metal contaminated biomass. Herein, we synthesized three types of biochar derived from Zn-hyperaccumulator residues with different pyrolysis temperature (ZHBC-300, ZHBC-500, and ZHBCSA-800) for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Endogenous Zn contributed to the improvement of the Zeta potential in ZHBC-300 and facilitated the formation of Persistent Free Radicals (PFRs) in ZHBC-500. At elevated temperatures, the evaporation of Zn facilitated the formation of Fe single-atom sites (Fe-N3O1) in ZHBCSA-800. The PMS activation efficiency of ZHBCs were significantly higher compared to that of biochar derived from non-contaminated hyperaccumulators at the same temperatures. The reaction mechanism shifted from a radical-dominated pathway in ZHBC-300 (86.1 %), to a hybrid pathway in ZHBC-500, and finally to a nonradical dominated oxidation by electron transfer process (ETP) in ZHBCSA-800 (82.65 %). Our work provides insights into the resource utilization of waste biomass for the development of environmental catalysts.
