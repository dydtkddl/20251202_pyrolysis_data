Unveiling the radical to nonradical pathway transformation in peroxymonosulfate activation by Zn hyperaccumulator-derived biochar pyrolyzed at different temperatures The efficient utilization of intrinsic elements is crucial for the functionalization of heavy metal contaminated biomass. Herein, we synthesized three types of biochar derived from Zn-hyperaccumulator residues with different pyrolysis temperature (ZHBC-300, ZHBC-500, and ZHBCSA-800) for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Endogenous Zn contributed to the improvement of the Zeta potential in ZHBC-300 and facilitated the formation of Persistent Free Radicals (PFRs) in ZHBC-500. At elevated temperatures, the evaporation of Zn facilitated the formation of Fe single-atom sites (Fe-N3O1) in ZHBCSA-800. The PMS activation efficiency of ZHBCs were significantly higher compared to that of biochar derived from non-contaminated hyperaccumulators at the same temperatures. The reaction mechanism shifted from a radical-dominated pathway in ZHBC-300 (86.1 %), to a hybrid pathway in ZHBC-500, and finally to a nonradical dominated oxidation by electron transfer process (ETP) in ZHBCSA-800 (82.65 %). Our work provides insights into the resource utilization of waste biomass for the development of environmental catalysts.
