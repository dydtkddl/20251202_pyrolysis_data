You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam co-gasification characteristics of black liquor char and petroleum coke coupled with TiO2 direct causticization The isothermal steam gasification experiments of a ternary mixture (BTP) containing black liquor char (BLC), causticizing agent (TiO2) and petroleum coke (PC) were carried out at 850 °C based on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a horizontal fixed-bed reactor. A co-gasification process of BLC and PC coupled with TiO2 direct causticization was explored from the aspect of reaction rate as well as the characteristics of gaseous products and gasification residues (GR). The results show that in comparison to the weighted average (BTPtheo) of the independent gasification of TiO2 direct causticized BLC and PC, significant synergistic effects could be aroused during the coupled co-gasification process due to promoting action of mNa2O·nTiO2 on gasification of organic carbon. Specifically, the maximum reaction rate of BTP reaches 7.0%/min, which is 2.9 times that of BTPtheo. The content and yield of effective gas components, i.e., H2+CO, in the gas products, as well as its lower heating value (LHV) of BTP are 81.1%, 2059 mL/g, and 9343 kJ/m3, respectively, which is 6.8%, 137.3%, and 5.5% higher than that of BTPtheo. The carbon conversion and energy output ratio of BTP reaches 95.0% and 1.13, respectively, which is increased by 61.6% and 135.4% relative to the theoretical superposition value. In addition, the relative loss of inorganic salts in BTP during the whole thermochemical conversion process is effectively controlled at a lower level of about 9.4%. Since the Na-containing salts in GR of BTP are mainly mNa2O·nTiO2 with higher thermal stability, and GR maintains good particle flowability, it is conducive to downstream alkali recovery.
