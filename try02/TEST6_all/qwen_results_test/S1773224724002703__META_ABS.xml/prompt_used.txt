You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) scaffolds for bone regeneration: Preparation, characterization and biological applications Altering biomaterials using nano additives such as nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) holds great potential to create innovative materials for diverse biomedical appliances like bone rejuvenation, pharmaceutical conveyance, and other medical tools. Presently, nHAp is an extensively investigated biomaterial within the medical realm, acknowledged for its established biocompatibility and its primary role in the mineral composition of teeth and bones. Furthermore, owing to its distinctive attributes like the capacity to form chemical bonds with bones, absence of toxicity or inflammation induction, and the ability to directly stimulate osteoblasts for bone growth, it stands out as a remarkable candidate. Herein, recent advancements in nHAp composites are deliberated which are featured as bioactive agents and have been utilized as carriers for drug delivery in the context of repairing bone defects. Blending nHAp with other substances can yield three-dimensional scaffolds for bone grafting, possessing adequate mechanical robustness, appropriate pore dimensions and permeability, and the ability to promote bone growth. Given nHAp's proficiency in accommodating drugs, integration of bioactive agents with nHAp composite can address the insufficiencies found in some scaffold materials, particularly their limited osteoinductive capabilities. Furthermore, various bone irregularities stemming from conditions such as osteomyelitis, bone tumors, osteoporosis, and bone tuberculosis necessitate both, bone reconstruction and relevant medication. Thus, coupling nHAp composite scaffolds with diverse medications can not only support bone defects but also hinder the proliferation of bacteria, tumor cells, and osteoclasts by means of gradual drug release, culminating in favorable bone healing outcomes. This protracted release mechanism transforms nHAp-based scaffolds into a promising approach within the realm of bone tissue engineering.
