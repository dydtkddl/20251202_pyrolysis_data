Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) scaffolds for bone regeneration: Preparation, characterization and biological applications Altering biomaterials using nano additives such as nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) holds great potential to create innovative materials for diverse biomedical appliances like bone rejuvenation, pharmaceutical conveyance, and other medical tools. Presently, nHAp is an extensively investigated biomaterial within the medical realm, acknowledged for its established biocompatibility and its primary role in the mineral composition of teeth and bones. Furthermore, owing to its distinctive attributes like the capacity to form chemical bonds with bones, absence of toxicity or inflammation induction, and the ability to directly stimulate osteoblasts for bone growth, it stands out as a remarkable candidate. Herein, recent advancements in nHAp composites are deliberated which are featured as bioactive agents and have been utilized as carriers for drug delivery in the context of repairing bone defects. Blending nHAp with other substances can yield three-dimensional scaffolds for bone grafting, possessing adequate mechanical robustness, appropriate pore dimensions and permeability, and the ability to promote bone growth. Given nHAp's proficiency in accommodating drugs, integration of bioactive agents with nHAp composite can address the insufficiencies found in some scaffold materials, particularly their limited osteoinductive capabilities. Furthermore, various bone irregularities stemming from conditions such as osteomyelitis, bone tumors, osteoporosis, and bone tuberculosis necessitate both, bone reconstruction and relevant medication. Thus, coupling nHAp composite scaffolds with diverse medications can not only support bone defects but also hinder the proliferation of bacteria, tumor cells, and osteoclasts by means of gradual drug release, culminating in favorable bone healing outcomes. This protracted release mechanism transforms nHAp-based scaffolds into a promising approach within the realm of bone tissue engineering.
