You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Anaerobic treatment in pulp- and paper-mill waste management: A review The pulp- and paper-industry generates large volumes of highly heterogenous wastewaters containing compounds from wood or other raw material, process chemicals and compounds formed during processing. The wastewaters from mechanical pulping and secondary fiber pulping as well as the condensates from chemical and semi-chemical pulping are typically non-toxic to methanogenic degradation and contain easily degradable organic compounds. Consequently, anaerobic digestion is an attractive treatment alternative for these effluents. In addition, both primary and secondary sludges from pulp- and paper-industry wastewater treatment-plants are amenable to anaerobic digestion. In contrast, the bleaching effluents from chemical pulping, the debarking effluents as well as the CTMP effluents are likely to be inhibitory to methanogenic degradation; also their biodegrability is relatively low. dilution with other wastewater streams or detoxification by various pretreatments have been used to facilitate anaerobic treatment of these inhibitory wastewaters. the potential of the anaerobic systems for reductive dechlorination and sulfur recovery is unique and of great interest. In almost all pulp- and paper-industry full-scale applications, anaerobic treatment is followed by aerobic post-treatment. The suitability and the cost of the anaerobic-aerobic and aerobic treatment-systems are largely affected by a variety of mill-specific factors.
