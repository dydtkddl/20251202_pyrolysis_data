You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of porous carbon sheet via organic acid salt activation for effective thallium(I) removal: Multiscale adsorption and DFT calculation The novel ultra-micro porous carbon sheet (PCs) with exceptionally high surface area (3034 m2/g) were synthesized through green potassium citrate (K3C6H5O7) activation for efficient thallium(I) [Tl(I)] removal from wastewater. The static adsorption results revealed that PCs achieved exceptional removal efficiencies above 95 % across pH 6–12, maintained high selectivity against competing ions (K+, Na+, Cl−, F−) and organic interferents, and retained above 80 % capacity after five regeneration cycles. Adsorption followed Pseudo-second order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm models, indicating multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces, with thermodynamics confirming spontaneous exothermic processes. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results demonstrated that lone pair electrons involved in complexation and π-electrons participating in coordination were supplied by oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic rings, respectively. The sorption mechanisms included surface complexation, ion exchange, electrostatic attraction, and cation-π interaction. The column sorption results demonstrated the influent flow rate, bed height, and initial Tl(I) concentration-dependent removal performance. The Tl(I)-containing wastewater at ppm level could meet the discharge standard by optimizing influent flow rate and bed height in column adsorption. The dynamic sorption process was described properly by Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models. This study provides a systematic theoretical foundation for designing porous carbons in Tl-contaminated water remediation.
