Advances in the development and application of analytical pyrolysis in biomass research: A review Analytical pyrolysis has been widely used in biomass research to study the reaction mechanisms, screen catalysts, optimize reaction conditions, and characterize products. Substantial progresses have been made during the past few decades in the development of analytical pyrolysis systems. The application of the analytical pyrolysis technique has also expanded from fast pyrolysis to other thermochemical processes such as oxidative pyrolysis, gasification, and solvent liquefaction. This review covers the recent advances in analytical pyrolysis in biomass research, focusing on the instrumental development and the expanding application. The future and the challenges facing by analytical pyrolysis are also discussed.
