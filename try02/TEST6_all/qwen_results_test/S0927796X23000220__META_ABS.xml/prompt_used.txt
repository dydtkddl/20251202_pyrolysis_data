You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of biomass-based functional carbon materials for energy conversion and storage With the increasing attention to energy and environmental issues, the high-efficiency utilization of biomass becomes an exciting new field in the science and technology. Biomass-based functional carbon materials (BFCs) with renewability, flexible structural tunability and diverse physicochemical properties have shown encouraging and bright prospects in the fields of energy conversion and storage. In this review, the recent advances of BFCs in energy conversion and storage are summarized and highlighted, which will shed new lights on the emerging applications of BFCs in wide fields. We comprehensively summarize the synthesis methods of BFCs, which include the strategies of carbonization, activation and functionalization. From the perspectives of multi-dimensional carbon material engineering, the structures and properties of BFCs are presented and analyzed. The recent advances in energy-oriented emerging applications, including photo-catalysis, electro-catalysis, solar cells, supercapacitors, metal ion batteries and microbial fuel cells are systematically summarized and highlighted. Then, this review gives a focus on the significance of establishing the relationship between the structure and performance of BFCs. Finally, the remaining major challenges and opportunities for BFCs in the future are discussed and outlined.
