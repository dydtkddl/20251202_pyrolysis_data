You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Precursors of tetragonal tungsten bronzes as catalysts in selective reactions: Liquid phase oxidation of diphenyl sulfide and gas phase oxidation of hydrogen sulfide Mixed metal oxides, of the type (KNaM)xP0.11WV0.2NbOx and (NH4)x/(Na)xP0.11WV0.2NbOx, were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis from lacunary heteropolytungstates, [M4(H2O)2(PW9O34)2]10− (MPW9, with M(II) = Co, Cu or Mn) and their precursor Na8H(PW9O34) (NaPW9), chemically modified by Nb(V) and V(IV). For comparison mixed metal oxides were also synthesized by using a Keggin heteropolytungstates [PW12O40]3− as tungsten precursor. The pristine samples were finally heat-treated at 500 °C in flowing N2 for 2 h. The resulting mixed metal oxides were characterized by several physico-chemical techniques and tested in both the liquid phase catalytic oxidation of diphenyl sulfide (DPS), in friendly environmental conditions (using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant), and in the gas phase partial oxidation of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur (using air at oxidant). Although the catalytic behavior of these catalysts strongly depends on the composition of catalysts, high activity and selectivity have been achieved over mixed metal oxides in both reactions. The good catalytic performance of species containing Cu(II) was evidenced in both reactions studied and the reactivity of this element could be explained by its structural and vibrational spectroscopic properties.
