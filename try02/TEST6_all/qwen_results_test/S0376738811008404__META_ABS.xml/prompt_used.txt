You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Desulfurization of jet fuel by pervaporation This paper investigates pervaporation, a membrane separation process for the removal of sulfur-containing components from jet fuel. To this end, one type of commercial membrane from PolyAn GmbH was applied. The influence of the crucial reaction parameters of the pervaporation process, such as feed temperature, permeate pressure, and permeate temperature, on the characteristic pervaporation measures such as permeate flux and enrichment factor was tested experimentally. Fuels with different sulfur mass fractions were applied and the long-term stability of the membranes used was studied. Different spectroscopic methods were applied to investigate correlations between membrane performance and material properties of the membrane. It was found that an increased feed temperature had a positive effect on the permeate flux while it had a negative effect on the enrichment factor. At 100°C, the permeate flux amounted to 5.44kg/(hm2), while it was only 1.16kg/(hm2) at a feed temperature of 80°C. At a feed temperature of 80°C, the enrichment factor was 0.47, while it amounted to 0.64 at a feed temperature of 100°C. In the case of the permeate pressure, the trends were also antagonistic. Low permeate pressure enhanced the permeate flux but deteriorated the enrichment factor. At a value of 20mbar, the permeate flux amounted to 5.44kg/(hm2), while it was only 0.16kg/(hm2) at 100mbar. The enrichment factor was 0.64 at 20mbar and decreased to 0.35 at 100mbar. Different permeate temperatures and sulfur mass proportions had only a minor effect on the permeate flux and the enrichment factor. Experiments on the long-term stability of the membranes used showed that fortunately the pervaporation process could be run for more than 500h using membranes from PolyAn GmbH while still showing a measurable permeate flux and a remarkable reduction of the sulfur mass fraction in the permeate. However, a significant deactivation with time on stream was observed. The permeate flux continuously decreased from 3.5kg/(hm2) to 0.5kg/(hm2) after 532h of time on stream. The enrichment factor increased from 0.5 to 0.6. Long-term experiments with pretreated membranes revealed that interaction between the hydrocarbon matrix in kerosene Jet A-1 and the membrane material itself was not responsible for the observed degradation of performance. Spectroscopic investigations were used to show that the reduction of the permeate flux was probably caused by an irreversible inclusion of polar – mostly aromatic – molecules in the polymeric separation layer of the membrane. The probable influence of unknown additives on the permeate flux could not be proven but should be considered. No degradation of the membrane material itself was found.
