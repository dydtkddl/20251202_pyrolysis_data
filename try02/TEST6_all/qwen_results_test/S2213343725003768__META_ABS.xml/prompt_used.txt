You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of metal-free mesoporous silica incorporated ZSM-5 composite on thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene Although different zeolites impregnated with transition metals have been used in catalytic deconstruction of waste plastics to other products, the influence of hierarchical structures on conversion and product selectivity in plastic upcycling has not been thoroughly investigated. This research explores a transition metal free zeolite-based hierarchical composite, synthesized by incorporating SBA-15 in ZSM-5 framework, for efficient thermos-catalytic upcycling of polypropylene (PP). Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that ZSM-5@SBA-15 can break down PP at a significantly lower temperature, 240 °C, compared to that of pristine PP using ZSM-5 or SBA-15. In addition, pyrolysis of PP at 400 °C using ZSM-5@SBA-15 composite outperforms ZSM-5 or SBA-15 used separately and yields 90 % conversion with 70 % selectivity to propene. The presence of mesopores in the catalyst appears to reduce the diffusion resistance of intermediate products for successive scission, thereby reducing the activation energy of reaction and improving catalytic activity. The hierarchical composite ZSM-5@SBA-15 has significant potential for upcycling of PP into valuable monomers and lighter olefins, with lower energy demands, enhancing the economic feasibility of the process.
