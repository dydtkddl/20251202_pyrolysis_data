You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-combustion of rural solid waste: Self-sustaining operation and pollutants emission Rural solid waste (RSW) is a serious problem which not only causes environmental pollution, but also limits the development of rural areas. Pyrolysis is an alternative since it can efficiently reduce RSW, meanwhile, the treatment capacity is matched for RSW production. However, conventional pyrolysis of RSW faces two important issues: energy cost and pollutant emission. Therefore, in this work, food waste (FW) was taken as the representative of high-moisture and low-heating-value organic waste in RSW, the energy required for pyrolysis, and the heat produced by combusting pyrolytic products were investigated. Based on calculating the Energy Ratio of Production to Consumption (ERPC) index, the self-sustaining pyrolysis-combustion conditions were established, and the carbon footprints in various scenarios were discussed. Additionally, waste paper, plastic, fabric and poplar scraps were selected as the representative organic wastes (OW) in RSW. The pyrolytic behaviors and pollutant emission (NOx and SO2) of individuals and blended OW were investigated. Compared to direct combustion of OW, the NOx and SO2 emissions can be reduced by 86 % and 100 %, respectively, during pyrolysis-combustion process. Combined the above aspects, it is proved pyrolysis-combustion can be a feasible approach to treat RSW, due to it can be operated without extra energy supply, and also shows obvious environmental benefits compared to direct combustion technology.
