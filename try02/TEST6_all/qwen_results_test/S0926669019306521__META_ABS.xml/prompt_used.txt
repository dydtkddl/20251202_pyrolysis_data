You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of energy crops as a source for nanocellulose production – Current knowledge and future prospects Countless years of industrialization have led to the continuous depletion of nonrenewable resources and high levels of pollution. The overuse of nonrenewable resources has served as a motivation for intensive research and development of new types of green bio-based and degradable feedstocks derived from natural sources. Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the least used bio-resources in the world, consisting mainly of lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses. This type of biomass is plentiful in biopolymers in nature and is obtained from several sources, among which are the residues from agricultural and industrial lignocellulosic crops. The cellulose extracted from the biomass can be depolymerized giving rise to an extraordinary nanometer scale bio-based material. Abundance, biodegradability, renewability and low-cost, coupled with excellent mechanical properties appoint nanocellulose (NC) as one of the most promising nanometric biomaterials. In recent years, the improvement of the production processes, as well as the properties of the nanocellulose, has been extensively studied, thus exploring a range of applicability in diverse technological areas. Due to its mechanical properties, the reinforcement in polymeric bionanocomposites has been pointed out as one of the most interesting applications of the NC. This review focuses on the recent developments about the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass obtained from different lignocellulosic agro-industrial crops, as a source of NC, by discussing (i) structure and properties of lignocellulosic biomass (ii) promising eco-friendly biomass pre-treatment and nanocellulose production procedures, (iii) recent technological applications. Ultimately, the critical assessment of the current knowledge will allow the identification of prospects, limitations and future opportunities of this nanomaterial.
