You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A multi-waste management concept as a basis towards a circular economy model This study proposes the use of a waste management procedure based on the technical development and practical implementation of a “Multi-Waste Plant” concept. A final point of this model is to reduce the costs related to waste treatment processes, thus optimizing its management, from the ecological viewpoint, as well as from the money related perspective. To this end, it is proposed: 1. Treatment, in the same facility, of various types of waste: municipal, industrial, biomass; 2. Energy and mass integration of individual waste treatment processes (anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis) to obtain a single integrated process more economical; 3. Complete recuperation of waste as energy (biogas, syngas and carbon pellets) and slow-release fertilizers (struvite). As a result, stable codigestion of a mix of poultry manure, pig manure, and vegetable waste (40/40/20 w/w) was achieved in a two-phase biodigester with production of biogas (65%CH4, energy content 6.5kWhm−3) and non-harmful digestate with phytotoxicity less than 25 Equitoxm−3, later transformed in struvite fertilizer with up to 95,4% of nutrients recovery. In parallel, the pyrolysis of a mix of organic fraction, waste biomass, plastic waste and other industrial waste (15/15/50/20 w/w) at 420-450°C produced non-condensable gas (86.2%, LHV 8.5kWhm−3), char (9%) and a liquid phase (4.8%). A Pinch analysis reveals that an energy integration process in the plant will make possible to cover energy needs of the whole facility. The “Multi-Waste Plant” concept along these lines turns into an unmistakable example of the circular economy model.
