Application of typical artificial carbon materials from biomass in environmental remediation and improvement: A review Artificial carbon materials (ACMs), notably hydrochar, pyrochar, and artificial humic substances, etc., are considered to be sustainable and eco-friendly materials for environmental remediation and improvement. At present, almost relevant literature mainly focuses on biochar, and it is necessary to systematically summarize and expand studies on ACMs. ACMs are widely used to solve pollution problems in water and soil environments, as well as to remediate and improve soil quality. This review focuses on the following issues: 1. Reveal the synthetic mechanisms and compositional reactions effects of the charring process; 2. Define artificial humus as a novel class of ACMs and discuss the application of environmental remediation and relative enhancement effects; 3. Research the relative mechanisms and significance of ACMs during remediation process, involving removal and fixation of heavy metal ions (HMs)/organic pollutants (OPs), modification of soil physicochemical properties, affecting microbial community effects, and improving fertility for crop growth. Finally, the cost-benefit analysis and security-risk evaluation of ACMs are pointed out.
