You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding catalyst deactivation in an industrial green hydrotreater and its correlation with catalyst composition Understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) processes in the production of biofuels. In this study sulfided metal catalysts, NiMo/Al2O3, NiMo/SiO2-Al2O3, and NiW/Al2O3 along with bare supports (Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, and zeolite Y) were placed in a refinery green hydrotreating unit. Potassium, phosphorus and sodium were identified as major poisons. The HDO activity of spent catalysts was assessed in a lab-scale batch reactor at 58 bar H2 and 325 °C for deoxygenation of oleic acid. The results highlighted that the active metals, particularly NiW, had a more pronounced tendency to attract poisons compared to the supports. However, with bare supports, coking was more significant and simultaneously less poisons were trapped, which could be due to blocking of the pores with coke. In the presence of these poisons there was a significant decline in oxygenate conversion compared with fresh catalysts, with a gradual reduction in activity for both decarbonation and direct-HDO products. Solvent washing treatments with DMSO and water were employed in an attempt to recover the activity of the spent catalysts, by partially removing the poisons. However, through these treatments, the activity of the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst could not be restored.
