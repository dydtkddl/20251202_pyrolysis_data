You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of an up-scalable rotary kiln design for the pyrolysis of waste tyres This paper shows how a design of an indirectly heated rotary kiln for the pyrolysis of waste tyres can be developed based on numerical simulation results. The design is up from a laboratory scale tyre particle mass flow to an industrial scale tyre particle mass flow, preserving the heat- and mass-transfer characteristics. This ensures that findings from the laboratory scale mass flow kiln, which is relatively cheap to build and to operate, are meaningful and representative for the industrial scale mass flow kiln. Due to high cost the scaled-up industrial scale design cannot be tested in advance. The development process based on numerical simulation minimizes the risk that scaled up designs do not reach desired performance values. A one-dimensional simulation model is described, enabling simulation of the temperature and mass flow profiles of the particle bed and the gas phase along the axis of the indirectly heated rotary kiln. The simulation considers the bed height development and the influence of fouling. The model is successfully validated against experimental measurements. It is then used to develop several rotary kiln designs covering a tyre particle mass flow range of two orders of magnitude, from laboratory up to industrial scale, fulfilling a variety of pre-formulated requirements. It is found that the kiln designs increase in slenderness as the bed particle mass flow increases, while the inclination and rotational speed can be kept constant.
