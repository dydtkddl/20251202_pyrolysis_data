You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Threshold temperature pyrolysis of waste plastic and the effect on pyrolysis energy consumption and product distribution Pyrolysis technology, as a key method of waste resource utilization, its pyrolysis efficiency directly affects the feasibility of circular economy. However, conventional pyrolysis processes often rely on higher pyrolysis temperatures, which not only increase energy consumption but also lead to a more complex distribution of pyrolysis products. Therefore, developing a pyrolysis process that is low in energy consumption and high in added value is particularly important. This paper uses polyethylene, the plastic with the largest global production, as the experimental material, and systematically analyzes the evolution of multidimensional parameters (pyrolysis characteristics, pyrolysis function models, apparent activation energy, and conversion rate) during its pyrolysis process. Based on the evolution of the multidimensional parameters, the “threshold temperature pyrolysis process” for polyethylene was developed, and its feasibility was verified through experiments and ANSYS Workbench simulation. The research results indicate that the threshold temperature pyrolysis process has a lower pyrolysis temperature and forms a stable thermal field distribution during the isothermal stage. This stable thermal field distribution not only reduced energy consumption by 6.1 % through regulating the reaction pathways of free radicals, but also increased the pyrolysis oil yield by 11.5 %. Furthermore, the lower pyrolysis temperature and stable thermal field distribution under the threshold temperature pyrolysis process regulate the migration of pyrolysis oil components towards lighter fractions by slowing down the reaction rate and extending the residence time of long-chain hydrocarbons. The above studies also provide quantifiable theoretical basis and methodological support for the high value utilization of other waste materials.
