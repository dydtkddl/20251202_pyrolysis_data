Kinetic NO x modelling and experimental results from single wood particle combustion Batch combustion experiments were performed in an electrically heated small-scale fixed-bed reactor to investigate the NO emission level from single wood particle combustion. The fuel-N to NO conversion factor varied between 0.11 and 0.86 depending on wood species and operating conditions. An extensive homogeneous kinetic modelling study was carried out to verify and explain the experimental results, assuming plug flow and perfectly stirred reactors. The NO x emission level increases in general with increasing excess air ratio, whereas it may show a maximum as a function of temperature, for both experimental and modelling results.
