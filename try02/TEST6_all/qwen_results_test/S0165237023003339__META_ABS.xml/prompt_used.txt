You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and properties of cellular carbon foam obtained from the pyrolysis products of a propane/butane fuel mix A mesophase precursor of carbon foam was synthesized by the pyrolysis of a propane-butane technical mixture; the precursor was shown to comprise polycyclic aromatic structures with the boiling point range from 200° to 400°C and above. The study revealed that the composition of the mesophase precursor can change with time, prolongation of which leads to the formation of higher molecular compounds. The formation of cellular carbon foam and its structure were studied; the possibility of obtaining closed and open cellular species was demonstrated. According to XRD, TEM and Raman spectroscopy data, the carbon material constituting the foam is nonporous and its nanostructure is typical of the carbon materials with a low ordering of graphene layers. A 70–80 nm thick carbon film in closed cellular carbon foam has a higher ordering of graphene layers and is readily removed in an air atmosphere (10 min, 850 °C) with the formation of open cellular carbon foam. The obtained carbon foam possesses high chemical and thermal stability and could be applied in the adsorption catalytic technologies. It was shown in experiments that this carbon material with a density 0.02 g•cm−3and oil capacity above 20 g•g−1 is promising for use as a regenerable petroleum sorbent.
