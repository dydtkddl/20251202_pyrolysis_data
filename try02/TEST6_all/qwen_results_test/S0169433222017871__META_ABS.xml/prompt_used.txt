You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced catalytic reduction of Cr(VI) with formic acid over spherical bimetallic Ni-Co nanoalloy catalysts at room temperature Exploring high-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for reducing Cr(VI) is one of the key problems in solving Cr(VI)-containing wastewater. In this paper, bimetallic Ni- and Co-based carbon sphere (NixCoy@NCS) was prepared by a simple hydrothermal-pyrolysis route, in which Ni-Co nanoalloys were uniformly dispersed on N-doped carbon sphere with average nanoparticles of 37.5 nm. The catalytic reduction performance of the hybrid catalyst NixCoy@NCS for Cr(VI) can be optimized by manipulation stoichiometry, and the catalytic ability of the Ni1Co1@NCS was much higher than that of other samples. This is because the synergy between Co and Ni NPs promotes the dehydrogenation efficiency of formic acid and the N doping improves the electron transport efficiency of the catalyst, and the strong protection of N-doped carbon for NPs ensured its excellent recycling ability and durability. In the existence of coexisting ions, the catalytic efficiency of the Ni1Co1@NCS is not affected at all. The reduction mechanism is mainly because of the active hydrogen during the dehydrogenation pathway of formic acid. This paper demonstrates that bimetallic Ni-Co-based materials have higher catalytic capacity than monometallic Ni or co-based materials.
