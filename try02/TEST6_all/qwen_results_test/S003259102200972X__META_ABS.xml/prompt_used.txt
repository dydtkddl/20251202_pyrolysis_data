You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on multi-solids fluidized beds Multi-solids fluidized bed (MSFB) is one particular type of fluidized bed with binary particles, comprising a dense fluidized bed of coarse particles mixed with fine powder percolating through and a dilute freeboard region of fine powder. Due to its enhanced mass and heat transfer and the ability to control fine powder residence time, emerging applications of MSFB, such as catalytic reaction processes, gasification and combustion of solid fuels, pollutant gas removal, and sorption enhanced reaction processes, call for a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals and developments of the MSFB. In this review, unique transition velocities are defined and correlated for the fluidized bed of coarse-fine mixtures. Complex hydrodynamic behavior, including solids holdup, entrainment and elutriation rates, bed turnover time and residence time of fine particles, pressure drop, pressure fluctuations, and gas dispersion of the binary particle fluidized bed are reviewed. Experimental data suggest that multi-solids fluidized bed can assist in the distribution and fluidization of fine particles with the presence of coarse particles. Heat transfer rate is improved in MSFB by increased heat capacity and inter-particle convective heat transfer, whilst enhanced gas-solid contact in MSFB leads to the improved mass transfer efficiency. Correlations for mass and heat transfer coefficients in MSFB are compared and suitable correlations are recommended. Performance of typical chemical processes that use MSFBs reported in the literature is evaluated.
