You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Product distribution in pyrolysis of cellulose in a microfluidized bed A study of flash pyrolysis of cellulose was carried out in the temperature range from 313 to 770°C in a microfluidized bed. Chemical analysis was done for gaseous and liquid products using gas chromatography. Levoglucosan was measured after silylation of the tar fraction. In the fluidized bed, residence times were of the order of 1 s, while heating rates were estimated at higher than 100,000°C/s for cellulose particles of 60 μm diameter and about 1000°C/s for cellulose particles having about 0.6 mm mean particle diameter. No pronounced effects of particle size were observed. Logarithms of product yields as wt.% of sample correlate linearly with bed temperature. Transitions in these curves are observed between 500 and 600°C corresponding roughly to decomposition of levoglucosan. Effects of atmosphere were also studied by comparing the effect of various atmospheres (CO, CO2, H2 + N2) with pure N2. Only a slight effect was noted on the product distribution. It appears that levoglucosan, a major product obtained from the slow pyrolysis of cellulose, is not a primary product under flash pyrolysis conditions.
