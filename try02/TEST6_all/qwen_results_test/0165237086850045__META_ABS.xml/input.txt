Product distribution in pyrolysis of cellulose in a microfluidized bed A study of flash pyrolysis of cellulose was carried out in the temperature range from 313 to 770°C in a microfluidized bed. Chemical analysis was done for gaseous and liquid products using gas chromatography. Levoglucosan was measured after silylation of the tar fraction. In the fluidized bed, residence times were of the order of 1 s, while heating rates were estimated at higher than 100,000°C/s for cellulose particles of 60 μm diameter and about 1000°C/s for cellulose particles having about 0.6 mm mean particle diameter. No pronounced effects of particle size were observed. Logarithms of product yields as wt.% of sample correlate linearly with bed temperature. Transitions in these curves are observed between 500 and 600°C corresponding roughly to decomposition of levoglucosan. Effects of atmosphere were also studied by comparing the effect of various atmospheres (CO, CO2, H2 + N2) with pure N2. Only a slight effect was noted on the product distribution. It appears that levoglucosan, a major product obtained from the slow pyrolysis of cellulose, is not a primary product under flash pyrolysis conditions.
