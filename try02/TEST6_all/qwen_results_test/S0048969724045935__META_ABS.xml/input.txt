Biodegradable biopolymers: Real impact to environment pollution Biobased biodegradable polymers (BBP) derived from different renewable resources are commonly considered as attractive alternative to petroleum-based polymers, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), etc. It is because they can address the issues of serious environmental problems resulted from accumulation of plastic wastes. In the review current methods of obtaining of most abundant BBP, polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), have been studied with an emphasis on the toxicity of compounds used for their production and additives improving consumer characteristics of PLA and PHB based market products. Substantial part of additives was the same used for traditional polymers. Analysis of the data on the response of different organisms and plants on exposure to these materials and their degradation products confirmed the doubts about real safety of BBP. Studies of safer additives are scarce and are of vital importance. Meanwhile, technologies of recycling of traditional petroleum-based polymers were shown to be well-developed, which cannot be said about PLA or PHB based polymers, and their blends with petroleum-based polymers. Therefore, development of more environmentally friendly components and sustainable technologies of production are necessary before following market expansion of biobased biodegradable products.
