You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biodegradable biopolymers: Real impact to environment pollution Biobased biodegradable polymers (BBP) derived from different renewable resources are commonly considered as attractive alternative to petroleum-based polymers, such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), etc. It is because they can address the issues of serious environmental problems resulted from accumulation of plastic wastes. In the review current methods of obtaining of most abundant BBP, polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), have been studied with an emphasis on the toxicity of compounds used for their production and additives improving consumer characteristics of PLA and PHB based market products. Substantial part of additives was the same used for traditional polymers. Analysis of the data on the response of different organisms and plants on exposure to these materials and their degradation products confirmed the doubts about real safety of BBP. Studies of safer additives are scarce and are of vital importance. Meanwhile, technologies of recycling of traditional petroleum-based polymers were shown to be well-developed, which cannot be said about PLA or PHB based polymers, and their blends with petroleum-based polymers. Therefore, development of more environmentally friendly components and sustainable technologies of production are necessary before following market expansion of biobased biodegradable products.
