You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a magnesium-based hydrogen storage reactor: From material synthesis to reactor optimization Solid alloys hydrogen storage is one of the most promising large-scale hydrogen storage technologies. However, the uneven internal heat distribution greatly affects its hydrogen storage efficiency. This paper starts from the synthesis of Mg-Ni-La-xMn (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 wt%) hydrogen storage alloys. Models of the hydrogen storage reactor are established and validated by experimental results. Three hydrogen reactor types, namely the single-tube reactor (SITR), the return-tube reactor (RETR) and the spiral-tube reactor (SPTR), are designed and compared from hydrogen absorption and desorption rates and temperature filed uniformity. Structural and operation parameters are further optimized. It is found that main components of the Mg-Ni-La-xMn alloys are Mg, Mg2Ni, LaNi5, LaMg12 and MgNi0.8Mn0.2. Introducing Mn content can not only increase the maximum hydrogen absorption, but also accelerate the hydrogen absorption rates. The Mg-Ni-La-2Mn alloy has the best hydrogen absorption and desorption performance. Hydrogen storage reactor performance comparison with Mg-Ni-La-2Mn alloy shows the SITR can hardly reach saturation absorption, whose hydrogen absorption is only 3.1 wt%. The maximum temperature of the SPTR is 27 K higher than that of the RETR during hydrogen absorption. The optimal tube diameter and spacing of the RETR are 6 mm and 8 mm, respectively. The practical hydrogen absorption capacity of Mg-Ni-La-2Mn alloy in the RETR reaches 6.2 wt%. The optimal hydrogen supply pressure in the RETR is 0.8 MPa during hydrogen absorption. The optimal thermal oil velocities in the RETR are 2 m/s and 1 m/s for hydrogen absorption and desorption respectively.
