You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biowaste valorization: Integrating circular economy principles with artificial intelligence-driven optimization for sustainable energy solutions Biowaste, encompassing food waste and agricultural residues, poses significant environmental challenges while offering transformative opportunities. Traditionally relegated to landfills or incineration, biowaste is increasingly recognized as a renewable resource for producing biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, and animal feed. This review offers a systems-level analysis of biowaste characteristics, conversion processes, and derived bioenergy products such as biofuels, biogas, biodiesel, biohydrogen, bioelectricity, and other valuable chemicals. Diverse conversion methods are explored, including anaerobic digestion, fermentation, microbial fuel cells, pyrolysis, and gasification, alongside conventional practices like landfilling and incineration. Emerging analytical advancements are revolutionizing biowaste valorization. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are highlighted for their transformative impact. For example, AI-driven optimization of pyrolysis conditions has enhanced biochar yield and quality, while predictive modeling using neural networks has improved the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) demonstrates a significant reduction in operational costs through AI-driven process optimization, and life cycle assessment (LCA) quantifies reductions in environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, due to AI-informed process adjustments. Advanced assessment tools, including material flow analysis (MFA), further evaluate resource dynamics within biowaste-to-energy systems. Artificial intelligence and ML optimize waste processing, improving efficiency and product quality. Key analytical tools like TEA, LCA, and MFA assess the financial and environmental viability of these processes.
