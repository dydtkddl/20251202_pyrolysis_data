You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of chlorophenols: Fate, toxicology and its treatment Chlorophenols represent one of the most abundant families of toxic pollutants emerging from various industrial manufacturing units. The toxicity of these chloroderivatives is proportional to the number and position of chlorine atoms on the benzene ring. In the aquatic environment, these pollutants accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, primarily in fishes, inducing mortality at an early embryonic stage. Contemplating the behaviour of such xenobiotics and their prevalence in different environmental components, it is crucial to understand the methods used to remove/degrade the chlorophenol from contaminated environment. The current review describes the different treatment methods and their mechanism towards the degradation of these pollutants. Both abiotic and biotic methods are investigated for the removal of chlorophenols. Chlorophenols are either degraded through photochemical reactions in the natural environment, or microbes, the most diverse communities on earth, perform various metabolic functions to detoxify the environment. Biological treatment is a slow process because of the more complex and stable structure of pollutants. Advanced Oxidation Processes are effective in degrading such organics with enhanced rate and efficiency. Based on their ability to generate hydroxyl radicals, source of energy, catalyst type, etc., different processes such as sonication, ozonation, photocatalysis, and Fenton's process are discussed for the treatment or remediation efficiency towards the degradation of chlorophenols. The review entails both advantages and limitations of treatment methods. The study also focuses on reclamation of chlorophenol-contaminated sites. Different remediation methods are discussed to restore the degraded ecosystem back in its natural condition.
