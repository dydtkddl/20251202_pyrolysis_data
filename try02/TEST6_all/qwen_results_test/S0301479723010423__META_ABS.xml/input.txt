A comprehensive review of chlorophenols: Fate, toxicology and its treatment Chlorophenols represent one of the most abundant families of toxic pollutants emerging from various industrial manufacturing units. The toxicity of these chloroderivatives is proportional to the number and position of chlorine atoms on the benzene ring. In the aquatic environment, these pollutants accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, primarily in fishes, inducing mortality at an early embryonic stage. Contemplating the behaviour of such xenobiotics and their prevalence in different environmental components, it is crucial to understand the methods used to remove/degrade the chlorophenol from contaminated environment. The current review describes the different treatment methods and their mechanism towards the degradation of these pollutants. Both abiotic and biotic methods are investigated for the removal of chlorophenols. Chlorophenols are either degraded through photochemical reactions in the natural environment, or microbes, the most diverse communities on earth, perform various metabolic functions to detoxify the environment. Biological treatment is a slow process because of the more complex and stable structure of pollutants. Advanced Oxidation Processes are effective in degrading such organics with enhanced rate and efficiency. Based on their ability to generate hydroxyl radicals, source of energy, catalyst type, etc., different processes such as sonication, ozonation, photocatalysis, and Fenton's process are discussed for the treatment or remediation efficiency towards the degradation of chlorophenols. The review entails both advantages and limitations of treatment methods. The study also focuses on reclamation of chlorophenol-contaminated sites. Different remediation methods are discussed to restore the degraded ecosystem back in its natural condition.
