Distributed gasification and power generation from solid wastes A small-scale gasification system for solid wastes has been developed and tested. In this innovative system, known as the STAR-MEET system, a fixed-bed pyrolyzer combined with a high temperature steam/air reformer is employed. From the experimental results using wood chips and polyolefin sheets as feedstocks, it has been demonstrated that injection of high temperature steam/air mixture into the pyrolysis gas can effectively decomposes tar components in the pyrolysis gas into CO and H2, resulting in an almost tar-free, clean product gas. A 900°C class compact metallic heat exchanger has been successfully developed, which serves as the high temperature steam/air generator for the STAR-MEET system. Finally, power generation experiments using a complete STAR-MEET plant have been successfully carried out. These results demonstrate small-scale gasification and power generation system using solid wastes is quite feasible.
