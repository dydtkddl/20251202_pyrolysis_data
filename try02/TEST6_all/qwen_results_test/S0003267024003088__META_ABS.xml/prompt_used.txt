You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquid phase detection in the miniature scale. Microfluidic and capillary scale measurement and separation systems. A tutorial review Microfluidic and capillary devices are increasingly being used in analytical applications while their overall size keeps decreasing. Detection sensitivity for these microdevices gains more importance as device sizes and consequently, sample volumes, decrease. This paper reviews optical, electrochemical, electrical, and mass spectrometric detection methods that are applicable to capillary scale and microfluidic devices, with brief introduction to the principles in each case. Much of this is considered in the context of separations. We do consider theoretical aspects of separations by open tubular liquid chromatography, arguably the most potentially fertile area of separations that has been left fallow largely because of lack of scale-appropriate detection methods. We also examine the theoretical basis of zone electrophoretic separations. Optical detection methods discussed include UV/Vis absorbance, fluorescence, chemiluminescence and refractometry. Amperometry is essentially the only electrochemical detection method used in microsystems. Suppressed conductance and especially contactless conductivity (admittance) detection are in wide use for the detection of ionic analytes. Microfluidic devices, integrated to various mass spectrometers, including ESI-MS, APCI-MS, and MALDI-MS are discussed. We consider the advantages and disadvantages of each detection method and compare the best reported limits of detection in as uniform a format as the available information allows. While this review pays more attention to recent developments, our primary focus has been on the novelty and ingenuity of the approach, regardless of when it was first proposed, as long as it can be potentially relevant to miniature platforms.
