You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Well-defined Ni3N nanoparticles armored in hollow carbon nanotube shell for high-efficiency bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis Alkaline H2-O2 fuel cells and water electrolysis are crucial for hydrogen energy recycling. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium pose significant obstacles. Thus, it is imperative but challenging to develop highly efficient and stable non-precious metal electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR and HER. Here, we present the intriguing synthesis of well-defined Ni3N nanoparticles armored within an N-doped hollow carbon nanotube shell (Ni3N@NC) via the conversion of a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) to metal-organic framework (MOF), followed by high-temperature pyrolysis. As-developed Ni3N@NC demonstrates exceptional bifunctionality in alkaline HOR/HER electrocatalysis, with a high HOR limiting current density of 2.67 mA cm− 2 comparable to the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C, while achieving a lead in overpotential of 145 mV and stronger CO-tolerance. Additionally, it achieves a low overpotential of 21 mV to attain a HER current density of 10 mA cm− 2 with long-term stability up to 340 h, both exceeding those of Pt/C. Structural analyses and electrochemical studies reveal that the remarkable bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalytic performance of Ni3N@NC can be ascribed to the synergistic coupling among the well-dispersed small-sized Ni3N nanoparticles, chain-mail structure, and optimized electronic structure enabled by strong metal-support interaction. Furthermore, theoretical calculations indicate that the high-efficiency HOR/HER observed in Ni3N@NC is attributed to the strong OH− affinity, moderate H adsorption, and enhanced water formation/dissociation ability of the Ni3N active sites. This work underscores the significance of rational structural design in enhancing performance and inspires further development of advanced nanostructures for efficient hydrogen electrocatalysis.
