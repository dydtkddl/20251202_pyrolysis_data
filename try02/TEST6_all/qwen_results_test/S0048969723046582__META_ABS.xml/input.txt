Effects of microplastics on the properties of different types of sewage sludge and strategies to overcome the inhibition: A review Microplastics have been identified as an emerging pollutant. When microplastics enter wastewater treatment plants, the plant traps most of the microplastics in the sludge during sewage treatment. Therefore, the effects of microplastics on sludge removal performance, and on the physical and chemical properties and microbial communities in sludge, have attracted extensive attention. This review mainly describes the presence of microplastics in wastewater treatment plants, and the effects of microplastics on the decontamination efficiency and physicochemical properties of activated sludge, aerobic granular sludge, anaerobic granular sludge and anaerobic ammonium oxidation sludge. Further, the review summarizes the effects of microplastics on microbial activity and microbial community dynamics in various sludges in terms of type, concentration, and contact time. The mechanisms used to strengthen the reduction of microplastics, such as biochar and hydrochar, are also discussed. This review summarizes the mechanism by which microplastics influence the performance of different types of sludge, and proposes effective strategies to mitigate the inhibitive effect of microplastics on sludge and discusses removal technologies of microplastics in sewage. Biochar and hydrochar are one of the effective measures to overcome the inhibition of microplastics on sludge. Meanwhile, constructed wetland may be one of the important choice for the future removal of microplastics from sewage. The goal is to provide theoretical support and insights for ensuring the stable operation of wastewater treatment plants and reducing the impact of microplastics on the environment.
