You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Technologies integration towards bio-fuels production: A state-of-the-art review Biomass is concerned as a most promising alternative energy resource. There are a number of biomass utilization technologies, most of which can be classified to either biological technology or thermo-chemical technology. Both have their specific bottleneck problems. Individual technology is currently almost reaching the ceiling, and technologies integration is thus proposed to make up drawbacks of individual technology with synergy effect. Technologies integration towards bio-fuels production include integration of biological technologies (e.g. algae cultivation from anaerobic digestate, secondary digestion of anaerobic digestate, anaerobic digestion of aerobic digestate, etc.), integration of thermo-chemical technologies (e.g. hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oils, steam reforming of fast bio-oils, cascade pyrolysis, etc.), and integration of biological technologies with thermo-chemical technologies (e.g. gasification of anaerobic digestate, pyrolysis of anaerobic digestate, carbonization of anaerobic digestate etc.). a comprehensive review concerning the state-of-the-art conceptual designs of technologies integration as well as their performances is urgently needed. Accordingly, this paper critically reviews: (1) State-of-the-art conceptual designs of integrated bio-fuel production systems; (2) Overall evaluation of different integrated technologies; (3) Insightful discussion on the future perspectives in this field. Concerning carbon conversion as an overall indicator for the performance of different technologies, it was found that the average carbon conversions were 70.71%, 75.29%, and 70.44% for integration of biological technologies, integration of thermo-chemical technologies, and integration of biological technologies with thermo-chemical technologies, respectively. This review is hoped to be beneficial for promoting future development of integrated bio-fuels production technologies.
