You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vulnerability of microplastics on marine environment: A review Microplastics (MPs), which are small plastic particles measuring less than 5 mm in size, have emerged as a significant environmental concern in marine ecosystems worldwide. The presence of MPs in aquatic environments has increased due to the contributions from anthropogenic and terrestrial sources, raising concerns about their abundance in aquatic organisms. MPs primarily originate from the photo-degradation of larger plastic debris (macroplastics), with their release into the environment often occurring through the breakdown of additive compounds. The ingestion of MPs poses eco-toxicological risks to marine organisms, causing damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and stomachs of affected organisms. Approximately 80 % of MPs originate from terrestrial sources, which can be classified as either primary sources, such as those generated during the production of skincare products, tires, and the use of MPs as carriers for pharmaceutical products, or secondary sources resulting from the improper disposal of plastics near coastal areas and water bodies. The issue of MPs and their potential effects on the marine ecosystem demands significant attention. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability of microplastics in marine environments, consolidating the current understanding of their sources, distribution, fate, and ecological impacts. It emphasizes the urgent need for ongoing research and proactive measures to mitigate the potential long-term consequences of microplastic pollution on marine ecosystems and the essential services they provide.
