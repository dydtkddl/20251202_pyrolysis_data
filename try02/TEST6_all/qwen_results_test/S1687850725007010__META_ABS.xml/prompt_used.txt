You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

AI-driven design and optimization of microwave radiation-induced pyrolysis systems using machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms Microwave radiation-assisted pyrolysis holds significant promise for sustainable biomass valorization, yet effectively modeling and optimizing this complex radiation-driven process remains challenging due to its inherent nonlinearity and multi-dimensional trade-offs. This study addresses this critical gap by proposing an innovative hybrid framework that integrates advanced machine learning, metaheuristic multi-objective optimization, and systematic multi-criteria decision-making. The primary objective was to holistically model, optimize, and prioritize operating scenarios for microwave radiation-induced pyrolysis of palm kernel shells (PKS) to enhance bio-char yield and quality. The methodology combines four phases: comprehensive input–output analysis, predictive surrogate modeling using the COMBI algorithm, Pareto-based optimization via the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (MOGWO), and final solution ranking using the weighted Tchebycheff method (WTM). The COMBI models demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy, with all objectives achieving an R2 greater than 0.99, ensuring robust generalization and reliability. Optimization outcomes revealed insightful trade-offs among reaction time, sample mass, and nitrogen gas flow rate. Notably, higher calorific values (up to 31 MJ/kg) were achieved with shorter reaction times (≈39–40 min), smaller sample masses (≈21–23 g), and lower nitrogen flows (≈100 mL/min), whereas maximizing fixed carbon content (up to 67.6 wt%) required longer reaction times (≈42–43 min), larger feedstock quantities (≈29–30 g), and higher gas flow rates (≈140–155 mL/min). Analysis of the Pareto front showed that over 55 % of optimal solutions favored shorter reaction durations, while nitrogen flow optimization consistently converged on low to medium ranges. Final ranking using WTM yielded ten distinct decision scenarios, each aligning with different technical and practical objectives. This flexibility highlights the framework's real-world applicability, offering a robust decision-support toolkit that enables practitioners to dynamically align pyrolysis operations with shifting market demands, energy efficiency goals, and environmental constraints.
