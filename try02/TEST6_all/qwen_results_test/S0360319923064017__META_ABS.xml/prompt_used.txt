You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes via catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts: Effect of Fe loading on the catalytic activity Thermochemical conversion is a promising waste plastic recycling technology from both an economic and environmental point of view, as it can convert plastics into high-value chemicals. In this work, the co-production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene over Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Fe loading (5, 10, 20 and 30 wt%) was investigated using a two-stage fixed bed reactor. The results show that the yield of CNTs and hydrogen increases first and then decreases with the increase of Fe loading. The 20Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst generated the highest CNTs yield of 262.24 mg/gPE and the maximum hydrogen production of 31.72 mmol/gPE. The fresh and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD, H2-TPR, SEM, TEM, etc., in order to explore the correlation between the catalytic activity and the Fe active metal load of the catalysts. The results showed that, within a certain range, the number of active sites increased with the increase of Fe loading, which promoted the conversion of hydrogen and CNTs. However, when the Fe loading reached 30%, the active particles agglomerated and inhibited the growth of CNTs. 30Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst produced many carbon nanoonions (CNOs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Overall, in terms of the yield of the produced hydrogen and CNTs, the 20Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the best catalytic performance.
