Xylooligosaccharides production from lignocellulosic biomass using a pilot-scale pretreatment continuous tubular reactor. Modelling and experimental validation This work proposes a mathematical model for describing the dynamics of xylan depolymerisation of lignocellulosic biomass in a pilot-scale pretreatment continuous tubular reactor. Xylan depolymerisation, modelled as pseudo-homogeneous first order reactions and mass flow dynamics, are described as a set of ordinary differential equations. The model accurately describes the dynamics of xylooligosaccharides and other depolymerisation products at the reactor output. Experimental validations of residence time distribution, mass flow rates and kinetics were carried out at 18 and 37 min of mean residence time for wheat straw, corn stover and sugar cane bagasse. Wheat straw exhibited the highest production of xylooligosaccharides (approximately 70%) without degradation at 37 min of residence time.
