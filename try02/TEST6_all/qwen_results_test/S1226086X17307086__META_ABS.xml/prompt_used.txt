You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From powder to extrudate zeolite-based bifunctional hydroisomerization catalysts: on preserving zeolite integrity and optimizing Pt location The development of zeolite-based hydroisomerization catalysts in the powder form is widely spread in scientific literature but shaped bodies are the ones being employed in industry. This work aims at bridging that gap. The shaping procedure for HUSY zeolite in presence of an alumina binder disclosed herein achieved a full conservation of zeolite properties, e.g. porosity and Brønsted acidity. When Pt was located inside the zeolite and an homogeneous Pt distribution along the extrudate was ensured, shaped Pt-containing catalysts had similar hydroisomerization performances to those of powder Pt/zeolite in terms of turnover frequency per Brønsted acid site and maximal feed isomers yield. Conversely, non-uniform distribution of Pt along the extrudates diameter (millimetric scale) was observed to reduce the feed isomers yield. This was tentatively explained by the lower local metal to acid sites ratio in the core of the extrudates. Optimal performance of shaped bifunctional catalysts requires, hence, an adequate metal to acid sites ratio throughout the whole catalyst (i.e. at millimetric and nanometric scale), even if full intimacy between catalytic functions is ensured at the nanoscale by the selective deposition of Pt inside the zeolite.
