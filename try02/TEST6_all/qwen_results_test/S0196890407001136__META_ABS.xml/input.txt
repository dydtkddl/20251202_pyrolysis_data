Experimental study on coke and heavy oil co-conversion process for production of light olefins and synthesis gas A new process, coke and heavy oil co-conversion for production of light olefins (ethylene and propylene) and synthesis gas, was introduced in this paper. Following the technological principle of this process, light olefins and synthesis gas could be produced. Using a fixed bed as the reactor and coke and Shengli atmospheric residue as raw materials in the preliminary study of hot simulative experiments, the effects of operating parameters on the gaseous products components and produced coke were investigated. When the mass ratio of oxygen/steam/residue was set at 0.3/1.0/1.0 and the pyrolysis temperature at 800°C, while the residence time lasted less than 0.5s, the contents of light olefins (C2H4, C3H6), alkanes (CH4, C2H6) and synthesis gas (H2, CO) were about 24%, 28% and 37%, respectively. The SEM images of the produced coke on the coked surface medium from residue pyrolysis were observed, and the results showed that the produced coke was almost consumed with blown oxygen. All the results demonstrated that the coke and heavy oil co-conversion process (CHCP) could produce light olefins and synthesis gas together, and the coking problem could be solved effectively. Therefore, the concept of this process is positive and feasible.
