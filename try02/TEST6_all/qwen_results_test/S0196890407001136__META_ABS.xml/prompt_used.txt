You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on coke and heavy oil co-conversion process for production of light olefins and synthesis gas A new process, coke and heavy oil co-conversion for production of light olefins (ethylene and propylene) and synthesis gas, was introduced in this paper. Following the technological principle of this process, light olefins and synthesis gas could be produced. Using a fixed bed as the reactor and coke and Shengli atmospheric residue as raw materials in the preliminary study of hot simulative experiments, the effects of operating parameters on the gaseous products components and produced coke were investigated. When the mass ratio of oxygen/steam/residue was set at 0.3/1.0/1.0 and the pyrolysis temperature at 800°C, while the residence time lasted less than 0.5s, the contents of light olefins (C2H4, C3H6), alkanes (CH4, C2H6) and synthesis gas (H2, CO) were about 24%, 28% and 37%, respectively. The SEM images of the produced coke on the coked surface medium from residue pyrolysis were observed, and the results showed that the produced coke was almost consumed with blown oxygen. All the results demonstrated that the coke and heavy oil co-conversion process (CHCP) could produce light olefins and synthesis gas together, and the coking problem could be solved effectively. Therefore, the concept of this process is positive and feasible.
