You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Size effects of precursor droplets on lithium-based nanomaterial synthesis using flame spray pyrolysis The initial size of precursor droplets is one of the few control parameters in flame spray synthesis of energy nanomaterials with profound but poorly understood effects. This study unravels the influence of the initial lithium precursor droplet size on the reaction kinetics and formation mechanism of lithium nanoparticles. The reactive molecular dynamics simulations are performed, followed by comprehensive analyses of the droplet's morphology and kinetic and potential energy evolutions, bond kinetics, gas decomposition and reaction pathways of synthesized lithium nanoparticles. The droplet volume keeps rising over time, accompanied by the gradual formation of a hollow structure, which can be interpreted by the predominant role of gas decomposition in shaping the droplet's morphology. As the droplet size increases, however, the explosion behaviour becomes less intense. Besides, more lithium atoms agglomerate to form larger lithium nanoparticles, as evidenced by the increased lithium bond number and reduced atomic mean squared displacements. The reaction pathways also suggest that randomly dispersed small lithium nanoparticles ultimately aggregate to form larger lithium clusters. When the ambient temperature is decreased, the initial droplet size has a more pronounced effect on the size of synthesized lithium clusters, primarily attributed to the reduced reactivity and increased stability of lithium nanoparticles.
