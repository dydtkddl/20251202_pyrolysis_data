Novel oxone treated hydrochar for the removal of Pb(II) and methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions This study represents the first ever work on a novel oxone treated hydrochar as an adsorbent for the efficient removal of different contaminants from aqueous solutions. Pine wood hydrochar (HC) was prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 300 °C and oxidized with oxone to produce oxidized pine wood hydrochar (OHC). Different analytical tools such as elemental analysis, FTIR, TGA, FE-SEM, and BET were used for the characterization of the OHC. Conductometric titration of OHC showed a substantial increase from 22 μmol/g to 600 μmol/g in the hydrochar carboxylic content. The OHC sorption performance was assessed by using Pb(II) ions and methylene blue (MB) dye as two models of contaminants. Sorption benchmarks were performed by varying the contaminant initial concentration, time, and temperatures. Sorption kinetic data was fitted well to the pseudo-second order kinetic model with high correlation coefficients (R2 > 0.99) and isothermal data was fitted to the Langmuir model. The highest adsorption capacities for MB and Pb(II) were 86.7 mg/g and 46.7 mg/g, respectively. This study proves that oxone treatment could be a potential sustainable oxidation method to tune the hydrochar surface to increase selectivity towards heavy metal ions and dye sorption.
