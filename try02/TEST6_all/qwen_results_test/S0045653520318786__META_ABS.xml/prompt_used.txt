You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel oxone treated hydrochar for the removal of Pb(II) and methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solutions This study represents the first ever work on a novel oxone treated hydrochar as an adsorbent for the efficient removal of different contaminants from aqueous solutions. Pine wood hydrochar (HC) was prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 300 °C and oxidized with oxone to produce oxidized pine wood hydrochar (OHC). Different analytical tools such as elemental analysis, FTIR, TGA, FE-SEM, and BET were used for the characterization of the OHC. Conductometric titration of OHC showed a substantial increase from 22 μmol/g to 600 μmol/g in the hydrochar carboxylic content. The OHC sorption performance was assessed by using Pb(II) ions and methylene blue (MB) dye as two models of contaminants. Sorption benchmarks were performed by varying the contaminant initial concentration, time, and temperatures. Sorption kinetic data was fitted well to the pseudo-second order kinetic model with high correlation coefficients (R2 > 0.99) and isothermal data was fitted to the Langmuir model. The highest adsorption capacities for MB and Pb(II) were 86.7 mg/g and 46.7 mg/g, respectively. This study proves that oxone treatment could be a potential sustainable oxidation method to tune the hydrochar surface to increase selectivity towards heavy metal ions and dye sorption.
