You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modelling the kinetics of coal depolymerization during hydroliquefaction Hydrogen donation and the release of nitrogen and sulfur compounds Coal liquefaction was conducted in a stirred batch reactor in the presence of tetralin (at tetralin/coal mass ratios of 4.7–7.0) and of hydrogen (at partial pressures of 10.5–13.7 MPa), at temperatures of 360–470 °C, and for 600 min at 360 °C and 435–450 min at the other temperatures. Liquid-phase samples collected periodically were analysed by gas chromatography, using f.i.d., n.p.d. (for nitrogen compounds) and f.p.d. (for sulfur compounds). The results (concentration of compounds in the reacting mixture vs. time) were analysed by a kinetic model describing the coal depolymerization process as a surface reactive phenomenon, and according to which the concentration vs. time of any compound or group of compounds produced directly from coal but not undergoing successive reactions is represented by exponential equations having a common characteristic time. The kinetic analysis indicated among other things that under the experimental conditions, nitrogen compounds released from the coal are essentially stable, whereas those containing sulfur undergo successive reactions. The rate constants and the activation energies of the reactions entering the kinetic model were calculated.
