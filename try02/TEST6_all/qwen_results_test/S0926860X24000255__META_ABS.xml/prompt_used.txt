You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deactivation by coking of industrial ZSM-5 catalysts used in LDPE pyrolysis and regeneration by ozonation process – Bench scale studies Study of the catalytic deactivation during successive uses of ZSM-5 catalysts in bench-scale pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (200:20 g LDPE:ZSM-5) has been carried out in a semi-batch reactor at 450 °C. The correlation between coke formation over catalyst properties and selectivity during pyrolysis is observed. The loss of catalytic performances translates into a significant drop of aromatics and an increase of waxes in pyrolysis products. The observed deactivation is due to the formation of heavy coke over the catalysts, causing surface hindering, porosity blockage and acid sites diminution. The capacity of ozonation process to regenerate such coked catalysts around 100 °C is demonstrated using a fixed bed reactor. Different times of exposure are investigated to evaluate ozonation efficiency. By using this coke oxidizing treatment during 48 h, regenerated catalysts recovered their initial textural and chemical characteristics (porous volume and acidity) as well as their catalytic performances (similar aromatics proportion as the first pyrolysis).
