Production and characterization of a value added biochar mix using seaweed, rice husk and pine sawdust: A parametric study A parametric study employing Taguchi's design of experimental technique was conducted to produce a value added novel biochar mix from three different origin feedstock and evaluate the effect of process parameters on biochar quality. Three feedstocks sourced from different origins (macroalgae: Sargassum sp, agricultural waste: rice husk and lignocellulosic waste: pine wood) were mixed in a definite proportion and pyrolyzed following the L4 experimental layout. Results indicated that temperature and mixing ratio were the most influential contributing factor. A temperature of 500 °C and 70% algae mix was the optimum condition to get an enhanced biochar in terms of thermal stability, aromaticity, pH balance, ash content and yield. Among the 4 Taguchi combination char S3 stands out as the best condition that resulted in high aromaticity, 40% high ash content, highly alkaline pH (10.3), 1–2% higher nitrogen and sulfur content. Potential application of biochar in agronomy as a soil ameliorant and/or in contaminant remediation as an adsorbent is suggested.
