You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A carbothermic hybrid synthesized using waste halogenated plastic in sub/supercritical CO2 and its application for lithium recovery Facile fabrication of porous carbon materials from waste halogenated plastic is highly attractive but frequently hampered due to potential release of halogenated organic pollutants. In this study, a novel type of carbon hybrid was tentatively synthesized from a real-world halogenated plastic as an inexpensive carbon source by sub/supercritical carbon dioxide carbonization technique. It was found that halogen-free carbon carrier was advantageously synthesized through carbonization of halogenated plastic without using catalysts due to zip depolymerization, random chain cracking and free radical reactions induced by sub/supercritical carbon dioxide technique. Exhibiting with more abundant functional groups including C–O, CO groups than pyrolytic carbon carrier, the derived carbon carrier demonstrated excellent performance in selective recovery of lithium from cathode powder with highest recovery efficiency of 93.6%. Mechanism study indicated that cathode powder was transformed into low-valence states of transition metals/metal oxides and released lithium as lithium carbonate due to collapse of oxygen framework via carbothermic reduction. This work provides an applicable and green process for synthesis of alternative carbon carrier from waste halogenated plastic and its application as carbothermic reductant in lithium recovery.
