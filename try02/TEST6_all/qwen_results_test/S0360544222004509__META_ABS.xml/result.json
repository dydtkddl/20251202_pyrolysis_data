  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study involves co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic, but the primary focus is on biomass (cow dung) with plastic as a minor additive, and the abstract lacks clear experimental data on plastic-specific pyrolysis or measurable yields from plastic-only or mixed plastic feedstocks."
