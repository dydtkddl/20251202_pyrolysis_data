You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of co-pyrolysis endpoint and product conversion of plastic and biomass using microwave thermogravimetric technology The purpose of this article is to explore possible ways to achieve synergistic optimization of bio-oil yield and energy recovery efficiency through microwave co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. The mechanism of co-pyrolysis was explored via an emerging microwave thermogravimetric technology of pyrolysis endpoint and product. The results showed that the microwave co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass shortened the reaction time and increased the bio-oil yield. Furthermore, the bio-oil oxygen content reduced and the formation of high-calorific components (gasoline and diesel components) was directionally improved. Owing to the decrease in oxygen content and the rise in aliphatic hydrocarbons, the chemical energy of the bio-oil increased from 1.76 MJ/kg (plastic mixing ratio: 0%) to 6.40 MJ/kg (50%). The energy recovery efficiency of the microwave co-pyrolysis of the cow dung with 50% low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was over three times that of the pyrolysis of cow dung. The feasibility of microwave co-pyrolysis in improving bio-oil yield and energy recovery efficiency were proved, however, higher cost is still one of the reasons hindering the widespread application of this technology. This work provides theoretical possibilities for the recycling of biomass with low energy consumption.
