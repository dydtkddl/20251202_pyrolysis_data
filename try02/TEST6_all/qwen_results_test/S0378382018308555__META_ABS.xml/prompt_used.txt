You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and catalytic reforming of ABS/PC and PCB using biochar and e-waste char as alternative green catalysts for oil and metal recovery This paper studied pyrolysis and catalytic reforming processes of ABS/PC and PCB as representatives of e-waste for possibility of energy and metal recovery. Y-Zeolite (YZ), ZSM-5, biochar (BC), electronic waste char (EWC), iron oxide loaded YZ (Fe/YZ), Fe/ZSM-5, Fe/BC and Fe/EWC were used as catalysts. Pyrolysis and catalytic reforming were performed at 500 °C. Results showed that the ABS/PC had high yield of oil (40–75%) whereas PCB showed limit amount of oil yield (lower than 8%). Catalysts increased single-ring hydrocarbon products in pyrolysis oil of both ABS/PC and PCB. Iron oxide originally in BC and EWC had the debromination effect during catalytic reforming process. Maximum debromination performance for ABS/PC and PCB feedstock was 91% (Fe/BC) and 68% (Fe/EWC), respectively. Metal compound in char was significantly high in case of PCB (16.025 wt%) and relatively low from ABS/PC (1.141 wt%). This research showed that using renewable catalyst precursors such as biochar or char from e-waste itself during pyrolysis and catalytic reforming was a promising method to recover low-bromine oil and metal. This could save cost on catalyst and increase possibility for implementation.
