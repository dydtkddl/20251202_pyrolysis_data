Lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment with a lignin stabilization strategy and valorization toward multipurpose fractionation Lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as a promising alternative with sustainable advantages for the production of a wide range of renewable products and value-added chemicals. In this study, a pretreatment strategy that use a fully recyclable acid hydrotrope (p-TsOH aqueous solution) to extract lignin and employ glyoxylic acid (GA) to stabilize lignin was proposed for biomass valorization toward multipurpose fractionation. 83.0 % of lignin was dissolved out by p-TsOH hydrotrope (80 wt%) with GA addition to form GA-stabilized product at 80 o C for 15 min. The stabilized lignin was subsequently used as an additive in the preparation of lignin-based suncream. Notably, the incorporation of 4 wt% lignin nanospheres into an SPF15 sunscreen yielded a measured SPF of 59.94. Furthermore, the depolymerization of uncondensed lignin into aromatic monomers yielded a high lignin-oil yield of 84.2 %. Additionally, direct heating of the pretreatment liquor facilitated the conversion of monosaccharides into furfural, achieving a desired yield of 53.7 % without the addition of any acid catalyst. The pretreatment also enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucan, resulting in a saccharification yield of 98.4 %. Moreover, short-term ultrasonication of the pretreated substrate yielded pulp suitable for papermaking. Incorporating 15 wt% fibers into the produced paper sheets led to a 5.3 % increase in tear index and a 25.4 % increase in tensile index. This study presents a viable pretreatment strategy for the multipurpose fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass, offering potential avenues for biomass valorization.
