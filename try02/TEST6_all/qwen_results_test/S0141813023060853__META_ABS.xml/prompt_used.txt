You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment with a lignin stabilization strategy and valorization toward multipurpose fractionation Lignocellulosic biomass has emerged as a promising alternative with sustainable advantages for the production of a wide range of renewable products and value-added chemicals. In this study, a pretreatment strategy that use a fully recyclable acid hydrotrope (p-TsOH aqueous solution) to extract lignin and employ glyoxylic acid (GA) to stabilize lignin was proposed for biomass valorization toward multipurpose fractionation. 83.0 % of lignin was dissolved out by p-TsOH hydrotrope (80 wt%) with GA addition to form GA-stabilized product at 80 o C for 15 min. The stabilized lignin was subsequently used as an additive in the preparation of lignin-based suncream. Notably, the incorporation of 4 wt% lignin nanospheres into an SPF15 sunscreen yielded a measured SPF of 59.94. Furthermore, the depolymerization of uncondensed lignin into aromatic monomers yielded a high lignin-oil yield of 84.2 %. Additionally, direct heating of the pretreatment liquor facilitated the conversion of monosaccharides into furfural, achieving a desired yield of 53.7 % without the addition of any acid catalyst. The pretreatment also enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucan, resulting in a saccharification yield of 98.4 %. Moreover, short-term ultrasonication of the pretreated substrate yielded pulp suitable for papermaking. Incorporating 15 wt% fibers into the produced paper sheets led to a 5.3 % increase in tear index and a 25.4 % increase in tensile index. This study presents a viable pretreatment strategy for the multipurpose fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass, offering potential avenues for biomass valorization.
