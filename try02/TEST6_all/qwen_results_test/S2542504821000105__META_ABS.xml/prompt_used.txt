You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of thermosetting composites for wind blade application It is well known that wind energy could represent a promising solution to the continuous increase of energy demand in the modern society. At the end of 2016 the European wind power amounted to 153.7 GW, distributed on 77,000 wind turbines and corresponding to the 10.4% of the electrical energy supplied. Considering the EU program to increase the renewable energy share to 27% by 2030, the key role of the wind energy in the next decade is clear. As the number of wind towers that will be dismantled in the next years will continuously increase, the development of sustainable practices to dispose of these plants at the end of their life is of utmost importance. Some parts of these turbines (tower, foundations, generator and gear box) are constituted by materials having elevated recycling rates, while the blades, that are nowadays made up of thermosetting fiber reinforced polymers, are very difficult to be recycled, because of the nature of the materials involved and their complex composition. Therefore, the aim of this review is to present the state of the art in composite wind blades recycling. In the first chapter, some general concepts about wind energy and composite wind blades are presented. The second section of the work is devoted to the analysis of the most important methods for recycling composite laminates. In the third chapter, a presentation of the recycling processes directly applied on waste composite blades is reported. Considering the actual difficulties in composite blades recycling, particular attention is devoted in the fourth chapter to innovative solutions to develop composite structures with improved recyclability, with some examples of modified thermosetting composites, innovative thermoplastic laminates and composites reinforced with natural fibers. The key aspects of composite wind blades recycling and the future perspectives are summarized in the last section.
