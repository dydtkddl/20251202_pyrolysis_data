You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of temperature role in the HDPE steam cracking product distribution with a focus on light olefins production The selective conversion of waste plastics into valuable chemicals, such as light olefins and single ring aromatics, was approached in an original fountain confined conical spouted bed reactor. The aim was the evaluation of the role played by temperature on product distribution and reaction mechanism in the steam cracking of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). Therefore, continuous runs were conducted between 675 and 800 ºC using a bed made up of inert sand. The reactor operated under vigorous spouting conditions to promote gas-solid contact and, at the same time, reduce the gas residence time. The proposed reactor design performs very well and is highly versatile to operate in a wide temperature range without operational problems. The steam cracking at 675 ºC led to partial conversion with a high oil fraction (44.9 wt%). The maximum yield of light olefins of 54.5 wt% was obtained at 700 ºC, with this yield steadily decreasing as temperature was increased. Cracking temperature had also an influence on the light olefin composition, with a marked decrease in the content of propylene and butenes and an increase in that of ethylene when temperature was raised. In addition, high temperatures also promoted the production of valuable single ring aromatics, i.e., a Benzene, Toluene and Xylenes (BTX) fraction yield of approximately 16 wt% was obtained between 750 and 800 ºC. Therefore, steam cracking in a fountain confined spouted bed reactor is an encouraging strategy to selectively convert plastics into valuable chemicals, such as light olefins and BTX aromatic compounds.
