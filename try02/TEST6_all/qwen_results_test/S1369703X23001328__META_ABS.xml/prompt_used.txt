You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrated poultry waste management by co-digestion with perennial grass: Effects of mixing ratio, pretreatments, reaction temperature, and effluent recycle on biomethanation yield This work aims to enhance the efficiency of integrated poultry waste management in bio-circular-green economy by maximizing the co-digestion of chicken manure and its digestate-grown biomass. In a series of batch assays, Napier grass (NG) was mixed with chicken manure (CM) at various proportions (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100) to identify co-substrate synergism, followed by physiochemical conditioning (size reduction and ultrasonication) of NG before co-digestion. Results indicated that NG mix of at least 80% was required to gain a full methanation potential of the individual substrates; no synergistic ratio above unity was found. However, the combined effect of size reduction and sonication was found to markedly improve the co-substrate’s biodegradability by 88.7%. The findings were then used to run continuous co-digestion at various operating regimes. In optimal continuous co-digestion condition, NG particle size of 0.6–2.4 mm combined with sonication intensity at 1111 kJ/kgTS improved biomethanation yield as high as 106.3%. Sub-thermophilic digestion at 45 °C was shown to give a higher and more stable CH4 yield than at 55 °C. Finally, it was also found that recycling liquid effluent at 40% to replace freshwater in feed, although showed no significant difference in CH4 yield (α = 0.05), noticeably increased system buffer capacity. This optimized biodegradation regime could give co-digestion waste management a higher overall plant efficiency and economic return.
