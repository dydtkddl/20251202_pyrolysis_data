You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic combustion of toluene over mesoporous Cr2O3-supported platinum catalysts prepared by in situ pyrolysis of MOFs Three-dimensional penetrating Pt-loaded mesoporous Cr2O3 catalysts (Pt@M-Cr2O3) were synthesized by pyrolysis of MIL-101-Cr containing pre-impregnated Pt NPs. Physicochemical properties of the samples were characterized by means of various techniques including XRD, Raman, BET, SEM, TEM, XPS and H2-TPR, and their catalytic activities were evaluated by toluene combustion compared with commercial Cr2O3 (C-Cr2O3). It is found that mesoporous Cr2O3 (M-Cr2O3) support with a high surface area of 77.40 m2/g is composed of vast Cr2O3 nanocrystallites. With pre-impregnated Pt loading in MIL-101-Cr, it partly restrains the aggregation of Pt NPs during the pyrolysis of MOFs to M-Cr2O3 and strengthens the interaction between Pt NPs and Cr2O3 nanocrystallites. The obtained 0.82Pt@M-Cr2O3 exhibits the best catalytic performance of toluene combustion, giving 120, 140 and 144 °C of T 10%, T 50% and T 90% under 1000 ppm of toluene at space velocity of 20,000 mL/(g h), respectively. The investigation of the different space velocity, the catalytic stability and the effect of water vapor on catalytic activity over 0.82Pt@M-Cr2O3 have confirmed the good catalytic performance. Furthermore, the studies of in situ DRIFTS indicate toluene degradation over 0.82Pt@M-Cr2O3 is via benzoate species by rapidly transforming of benzylic and aldehydic species, and then oxidized to maleic anhydride in an aromatic-ring opening reaction, finally is decayed to CO2 and H2O.
