You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic modules via deep-eutectic solvents – Part B End-of-life (EOL) crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules are rich in a large number of valuable metals, and their recycling is an important part of the PV industry’s “ecosystem”. Decapsulation of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant in PV modules is the most critical step to realize PV module recycling. However, currently, the decapsulation of PV modules by pyrolysis, wet dissolution, and mechanical crushing still faces the challenges of toxic waste gas, waste liquid outflow, and low separation rate. Herein, a biodegradable, reagent recyclable and cost-effective deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were developed in this study. Choline chloride-oxalic acid dihydrate (ChCl-OAD) was utilized to achieve complete dissociation of encapsulated EVA components by taking advantage of its low dynamic viscosity and excellent wettability. Molecular dynamics calculations and experiments showed that the unencapsulation of the EVA adhesive film was achieved by DES-induced hydrolysis to selectively leach the aluminum layer between the solar cell layers. Promoting the penetration of reagents and increasing the reaction rate to further enhance the complete deblocking of the module. The developed ChCl-OAD solvent can replace the traditional toxic reagents, providing an environmentally friendly and effective solution for efficient decapsulation of EOL PV modules.
