Green recycling of end-of-life photovoltaic modules via deep-eutectic solvents – Part B End-of-life (EOL) crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) modules are rich in a large number of valuable metals, and their recycling is an important part of the PV industry’s “ecosystem”. Decapsulation of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulant in PV modules is the most critical step to realize PV module recycling. However, currently, the decapsulation of PV modules by pyrolysis, wet dissolution, and mechanical crushing still faces the challenges of toxic waste gas, waste liquid outflow, and low separation rate. Herein, a biodegradable, reagent recyclable and cost-effective deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were developed in this study. Choline chloride-oxalic acid dihydrate (ChCl-OAD) was utilized to achieve complete dissociation of encapsulated EVA components by taking advantage of its low dynamic viscosity and excellent wettability. Molecular dynamics calculations and experiments showed that the unencapsulation of the EVA adhesive film was achieved by DES-induced hydrolysis to selectively leach the aluminum layer between the solar cell layers. Promoting the penetration of reagents and increasing the reaction rate to further enhance the complete deblocking of the module. The developed ChCl-OAD solvent can replace the traditional toxic reagents, providing an environmentally friendly and effective solution for efficient decapsulation of EOL PV modules.
