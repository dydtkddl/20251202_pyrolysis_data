You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of hydrogen-rich syngas from coal and sewage sludge co-gasification in supercritical water Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of coal and biomass waste complies with the structure of energy consumption and the targets for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. In this work, the optimal blending ratio and thermochemical transformation characteristics of coal and sewage sludge (SS) co-gasification were explored experimentally at various temperatures (500–660 °C), residence time (0–40 min), feedstock concentrations (5–15 %), and catalyst utilization. The demethylation and dehydroxylation of intermediate products (aliphatic compounds, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs)) improve the gasification performance under favorable experiment conditions (high temperature, long residence time, low feedstock concentration, and addition of catalysts). The optimal gasification results are an H2 yield of 38.36 mol/Kg and a 118.81 % increase of CGE (cold gas efficiency) in K2CO3-catalyzed gasification compared to the absence of the catalyst. Subsequently, the co-gasification mechanism of coal and SS was determined by the analysis of the three-phase product. Ultimately, a regression model was first established to obtain the practical optimization mechanism and yield prediction of hydrogen-rich syngas through response surface plots and regression equations. As verified in multiple experiments under varying situations, the regression model’s fitting accuracy yields an average relative error of 5.53 %.
