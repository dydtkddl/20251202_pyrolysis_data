You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Entrained flow gasification of sewage sludge digestate: Experimental and simulation study This work explores the entrained flow gasification of sewage sludge digestate (SSD) and its mixtures with wood powder (WP) through experimental and modeling approaches. Key parameters including reactor temperature, pressure, steam-to-biomass ratio (S/B), and air excess ratio (λ) were investigated to assess their impact on gasification performance. Results showed that blending SSD with WP significantly improved gasification efficiency, leading to higher hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) yields. Complete carbon conversion was achieved at temperatures above 1100 °C with a 50/50 SSD/WP mixture, highlighting the effectiveness of WP addition. Cold gas efficiency (CGE) exceeded 100 % for mixed feedstocks at optimal conditions, demonstrating improved syngas quality. SEM-EDS analysis indicated better properties and nutrient retention potential of residues derived from gasification of blended feedstocks. Computational Particle Fluid Dynamics (CPFD) simulations, validated against experimental data, provided deeper insights into gasification, confirming enhanced syngas production and reactor performance with SSD/WP mixtures. These findings underline the potential of SSD and WP co-gasification for sustainable waste management and energy recovery.
