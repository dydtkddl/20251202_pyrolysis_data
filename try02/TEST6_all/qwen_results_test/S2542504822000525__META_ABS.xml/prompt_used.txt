You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in the devulcanization technologies of industrially relevant sulfur-vulcanized elastomers The interesting thermomechanical properties of rubber materials have favored their widespread application in many fields, with a consequent increase in the amount of worn synthetic and natural rubber discarded every year. However, the complex three-dimensional molecular structure of rubber complicates the recycling and degradation process, and the current rubber waste management measures (i.e., landfilling, incineration, rubber grinding) are found to be unsustainable or substantially inadequate. On the other hand, devulcanization technologies, thanks to the selective cleavage of crosslinks, represent a sustainable and feasible approach to obtain a material that can be reintroduced into the rubber value chain or reused in novel eco-sustainable thermoplastic or elastomeric blends. Hence, this review provides an overview of the current rubber waste management techniques and devulcanization technologies, highlighting the underlying devulcanization mechanisms, describing the pros and cons of each method, and presenting some literature examples. Since most of the research on devulcanization has been made on waste tires, this review mainly focuses on the most widely used rubber classes for this application, i.e., natural rubber (NR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and the most common vulcanization technique, i.e., sulfur vulcanization. Considering the importance of the application of a circular economy approach, this work also reviews the applications of rubber devulcanizates, focusing on how devulcanized rubber can be compounded with different polymeric matrices to develop eco-sustainable polymer blends with suitable physical properties.
