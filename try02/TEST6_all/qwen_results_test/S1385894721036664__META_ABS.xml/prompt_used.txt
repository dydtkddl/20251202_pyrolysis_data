You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Maximizing light olefins and aromatics as high value base chemicals via single step catalytic conversion of plastic waste Chemical recycling of plastic waste via thermochemical processes is essential to move to a carbo-circular economy, reducing our dependence of fossil resources. However, recovering monomers from polyolefins in one or multiple steps is challenging due to their chemical inertness. In the present work, a tandem micro-pyrolyzer coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and FID/ToF-MS detectors was utilized to study the performance of industrial formulations of steam-treated FCC catalysts and HZSM-5 additives for the in-line catalytic upgrading of polyolefin pyrolysis products towards light olefins and aromatics in two steps. When upgrading pyrolysis vapors from LDPE over the steam-treated catalysts at 600 °C, CH4 yields did not exceed 0.5 wt% due to their low acidity. The FCC catalyst formulations obtained higher yields of C5-C11 aliphatics (up to 42 wt%) and were more active in converting C12 + products than the HZSM-5-containing additives. The highest C2-C4 olefin selectivity of 53 wt% was obtained using a bare steam-treated HZSM-5 additive. With this catalyst, at higher catalyst loading and temperature (700 °C), the light olefin yield reached 69 wt% (19% ethylene, 22% propylene, 10% 1,3-butadiene, and 18% other C4 olefins). Importantly, similar yields of light olefins with even higher propylene yields of 31 wt% were obtained when processing real post-consumer mixed polyolefin waste. An adjusted loading of unsteamed catalyst (to obtain a similar level of initial conversion of C12 + products) showed higher coking propensity and deactivated more rapidly than its steam-treated version. The research results show great potential for the pyrolysis of mixed polyolefin waste followed by the direct in-line upgrading of the pyrolysis vapors to produce high value base chemicals such as C2-C4 olefins, aromatics, and naphtha-range aliphatics at high selectivity while limiting formation of coke, CH4, and H2.
