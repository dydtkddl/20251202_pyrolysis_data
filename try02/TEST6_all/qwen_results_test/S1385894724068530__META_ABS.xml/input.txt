Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of biomass to high-value products: Factors assessment, mechanism analysis, and critical issues proposal As the fourth largest energy source, biomass offers the advantages of renewable, abundant resources, and carbon–neutrality. Microwave catalytic pyrolysis is a biomass thermochemical conversion technology with improved energy efficiency and rapid heating. Compared to conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis reduces the secondary reaction time of volatiles and increases the yield of gas phase products. This paper reviews the key influencing factors and kinetic studies of the pyrolysis process in order to introduce the basic theory of microwave pyrolysis. High volatile fraction increases the bio-oil yield; selection of appropriate temperature, residence time and hydrogen-rich materials can improve the conversion efficiency. The catalytic mechanism of the catalysts in the pyrolysis process is discussed. The metals and zeolites contributing to the decomposition of the acids to produce stable by-products. Focusing on the mechanism of generation of high-value liquid fuels (hydrocarbon-rich, phenol-rich) in order to optimize the production process. Current problems and solutions in the microwave pyrolysis are proposed based on the key influencing factors in the pyrolysis process, for example, coking deactivation and microwave non-responsiveness of catalysts, and the construction of catalysts with catalytic and wave-absorbing functions is a research hotspot.
