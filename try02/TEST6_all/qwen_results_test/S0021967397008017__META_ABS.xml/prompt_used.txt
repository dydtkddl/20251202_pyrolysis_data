You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modification of a commercial pyrolysis probe to improve its temporal and spatial temperature profiles Performance evaluation using model polymers A coiled-filament probe of a commercially available pyrolyzer (Chemical Data Systems, CDS Pyroprobe 120) was modified to change the temporal and spatial temperature profiles delivered by the probe. The modification changes the geometry of the heating filament: it is coiled tightly and a light coating of a ceramic cement is applied to maintain its dimensional stability while minimizing the possibility of developing an electrical short. The modified pyroprobe produced a reproducible and uniform temperature profile over a ∼3-mm long pyrolysis region and had near-perfect emissivity (∼0.95) for monitoring temperature with an optical thermometer. To conduct experiments off-line we also designed a glass housing for the tightly-coiled pyroprobe (TC-pyp). The housing has provisions for making a gas-tight seal with the pyroprobe, for introducing a gas to control the pyrolysis atmosphere and provide a rapid sweep of the pyrolysis region and for interfacing with a pre-trap to collect pyrolysates. To evaluate the results obtained with the TC-pyp we compared mass and temperature dependencies of Kraton D1107P pyrograms with those generated by a Pt ribbon-pyroprobe (PtR-pyp) and an unmodified coil pyroprobe. In addition, we report on the use of the instrumentation for quantitative analyses of model polymers.
