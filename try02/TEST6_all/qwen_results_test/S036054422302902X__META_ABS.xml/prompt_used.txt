You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic and economic analysis of a novel thermoelectric-hydrogen co-generation system combining compressed air energy storage and chemical energy With the adjustment of energy structure, the proportion of renewable energy is gradually increasing, and how to solve the problem of renewable energy consumption is becoming more and more prominent. Therefore, a novel thermoelectric-hydrogen co-generation system combining compressed air energy storage (CAES) and chemical energy (CE) is proposed. For energy storage, the system uses adiabatic compression with liquid piston to reduce the generation of compression heat, while using the generated compression heat to preheat the methanol. For energy release, the methanol is fed into the methanol steam reforming reactor (MSR) and the methanol decomposition reactor (MDR) in certain proportions for the hydrogen production reaction; the unreacted methanol and the carbon monoxide produced by the MDR are used as make-up heat for the reactors and the high-pressure air before the turbine, while the exhaust waste heat supplies heat to the customer. The thermodynamic, economic and environmental performances of the system were investigated separately by developing a mathematical model describing the system. The results show that under the design conditions, the system has an energy storage density of 12.00 kWh/m3, an energy efficiency of 88.47 %, an exergy efficiency of 77.04 %, a lifetime net present value of 59.20 M$, a payback period of 4 years, and a CO2 emission per unit of energy output of 227.85 kg/MWh. Increasing the thermostatic heat source temperature and increasing the reactor diameter and length increased the methanol conversion rate. Increasing heat exchange effectiveness of the heat exchanger and heat source temperature can all improve system thermodynamic and economic performance. The energy storage density, energy efficiency, net present value and profitability of the system varied parabolically with the reactor tube diameter. The system energy storage density had a maximum value of 12.03 kWh/m3 at a reactor diameter of 0.040 m.
