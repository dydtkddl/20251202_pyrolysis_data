Catalytic pyrolysis of low-density waste polyethylene into light olefins and hydrogen over manganese-supported alumina Catalytic pyrolysis can potentially convert plastic waste to olefins, moving a step further towards a circular economy. This study explores an in-situ two-step continuous catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to light olefins. The 1st step consists of the thermal pyrolysis of LDPE and the subsequent conversion of pyrolysis vapour to olefins over a Mn/Al2O3 catalyst. The results showed that Mn(10 %)/Al2O3 catalysts are beneficial for producing maximum light olefins (∼60 wt% of gas), while Ni(10 %)/Al2O3 is inherently more hydrogen-selective (∼17 % of gas) at 450 °C. This is due to the higher dehydrogenation ability of Mn in comparison to Ni. The yield of olefins in gaseous products reached up to 61.4 %, and that of gases in the overall product was 63.5 % during in-situ catalytic pyrolysis over Mn(5 %)/Al2O3 at 450 °C. The activation energy of LDPE degradation was calculated using KAS, Starink, FWO and Friedman methods (Ea; 152.8, 152.2, 155.8 and 200.5 kJmol−1 respectively), and R2 type (shrinking core model) of the degradation mechanism of LDPE was proposed using the Coats-Redfern method (Ea; 152.8 kJmol−1).
