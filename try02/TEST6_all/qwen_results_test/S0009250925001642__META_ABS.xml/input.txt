Controlled depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate based on twin-screw extruder and repolymerization of the depolymerized products The highly-efficient alcoholysis strategy of PET and the reuse of the depolymerization products are of great importance. This study develops continuous and efficient depolymerization strategy of PET without catalysts using a twin-screw extruder with BHET as the alcoholysis agent. The results show that PET can be rapidly depolymerized into oligomers (3000–6000 g/mol) in a few minutes with the molecular weight effectively controlled by adjusting BHET amounts. The screw speed and the amount of BHET added have a significant impact on the molecular weight of the oligomers. The alcoholysis reaction follows first-order reaction kinetics with a high activation energy (97 kJ/mol). The oligomers obtained from depolymerization are melt condensed to prepare regenerated PET (rPET) within 1 h, which has thermodynamic properties similar to commercial PET. The recycling strategy of “polymer-oligomer-polymer” saves reaction time, improves recycling efficiency, and provides a new idea for the treatment of waste plastics.
