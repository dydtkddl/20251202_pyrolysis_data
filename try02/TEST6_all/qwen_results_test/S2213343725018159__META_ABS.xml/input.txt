Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced modification of nanomaterials for enhanced performance in solar cells, photoelectrochemical water splitting and supercapacitors Ionizing radiation (IR) has emerged as a transformative tool for modifying nanomaterials (NMs), owing to its high energy, deep penetration and ability to induce significant changes in key physicochemical characteristics. Recent research has explored the use of gamma-rays (γ), neutrons (n), alpha particles (α), X-rays and beta particles (β) to enhance nanomaterial properties for energy conversion and storage applications. The structural modifications induced by IR are highly dose-dependent: low doses cause minimal changes, while higher doses can result in crystallinity degradation, lattice defects and atomic bond disruption. Also, in extreme cases, high-dose irradiation may lead to phase transitions or complete amorphization, significantly impacting material stability and functionality. These effects provide a tunable platform for engineering nanomaterials toward advanced energy applications. This review highlights the fundamental interactions between IR and nanomaterials, emphasizing radiation-induced transformations in structure, morphology, optical properties, chemical bonding and electronic behavior. Additionally, IR-assisted synthesis and fabrication techniques are also discussed, along with their implementation in solar cells, electrochemical systems and supercapacitors. Finally, key challenges such as safety concerns, environmental impact, scalability and technological limitations are addressed and emerging directions are proposed for advancing IR-engineered nanomaterials as sustainable solutions for future energy technologies.
