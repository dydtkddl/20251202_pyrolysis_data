You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards solvothermal upcycling of mixed plastic wastes: Depolymerization pathways of waste plastics in sub- and supercritical toluene Solvothermal liquefaction (STL) is a thermochemical conversion process, where a waste feedstock is treated with sub-and supercritical solvents. The key objective of the study was to investigate how a one-step STL using toluene as a solvent can degrade hard-to-recycle waste plastics (#5–#7). Three different plastic wastes namely, polypropylene (#5), polystyrene (#6), and polyurethane (#7), and their equal mixture (by weight, also referred here as mixed plastic wastes) were solvothermally liquefied by toluene in a 7 mL pressure bomb at 300, 350, and 400 °C for 3, 6, and 9 h in order to determine the effect of temperature and time, respectively. The liquid products were separated from the solid residue and further analyzed in terms of the STL conversion, change in elemental compositions via ultimate analysis, boiling point distribution via thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), alteration of chemical bonds via proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), and degradation products via gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS). The results showed that the STL conversion increase with the increase of reaction temperature and time. From the elemental analysis, it can be predicted that the higher heating values of the crude products are between 30 and 45 MJ/kg. Boiling point distribution showed that the production of lower hydrocarbon (C8–C20) increased significantly from about 10% at 300 °C to 80% at 400 °C. Additionally, product distribution showed that the aromaticity increased with the increase of residence time where the main products are benzene and styrene like products. Overall, it was observed that mixed plastic wastes have a synergistic effect on the degradation products.
