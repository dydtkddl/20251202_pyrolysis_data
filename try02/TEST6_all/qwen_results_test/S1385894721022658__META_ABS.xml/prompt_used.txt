You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isolated copper ions and surface hydroxyl groups as a function of non-redox metals to modulate the reactivity and persulfate activation mechanism of spinel oxides In advance oxidation processes (AOPs), modulating the activation mechanism from free radical to the non-radical pathway is the most attractive strategy for the treatment of recalcitrant pollutants. Herein, we achieved this goal after modifying the spinel CuFe2O4 catalyst by introducing non-redox metals (M = Mg, Ca, Ba, and Zn) as CuMFe2O4. The modified catalysts were evaluated for the removal of acetaminophen (ACE) using the persulfate (PS) activated system. The results revealed that the non-redox metals not only enhanced the catalytic activity of CuFe2O4 in the order of Mg > Zn > Ca > Ba but also switched the original radical pathway of CuFe2O4/PS system to the non-radical one (i.e., direct electron transfer path) of CuMgFe2O4/PS system. The critical role of non-redox metals to modulate the reaction mechanism was studied in detail using the extensive radical scavengers, EPR analysis, target pollutants selectivity, electrochemical studies, decomposition of oxidants, and identification of degradation products. Additionally, various experiments and characterizations, including XRD, EPR, H2-TPR, XPS, and FTIR, showed that the changes in the activation mechanism and catalytic activity (6–8 folds higher in the case of CuMgFe2O4) were related to the generation of a large amount of surface-bound isolated Cu2+ ions and abundant surface hydroxyl groups. The non-radical pathway of the CuMgFe2O4/PS system showed less susceptibility to the changing solution pH, excessive amount of humic acid (HA) or anions, and complete recyclability, and thus demonstrating good practical utility for wastewater. This study provides deep insight into the intrinsic role of non-redox metals to modulate both the activation mechanism and catalytic properties of the catalyst and to design new catalysts for the persulfate-based advance oxidation process.
