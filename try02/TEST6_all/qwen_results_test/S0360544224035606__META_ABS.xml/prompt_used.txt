You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Economic benefits for the metallurgical industry from co-combusting pyrolysis gas from waste The paper presents some benefits that can be gained in the metallurgical industry from utilizing pyrolysis gas obtained from biomass and plastic waste, in particular in a pusher type reheating furnace. The typical fuel composition that normally involves a mixture of natural gas and coke oven gas was modified by introducing a 9–16 % share of pyrolysis gas. The materials used in the production of the pyrolysis gas were alder and pine chips, as well as polypropene waste. For all these materials, the contents of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen were experimentally estimated on a test stand for solid fuel conversion in a stationary bed at the temperature of 600 °C. The design capacity of the furnace was 90 t/h and the installed power of the furnace was 72.3 MW. Based on data gained from the rolling mill of a steel mill located in Poland, analysis of the profitability of using pyrolysis gas for co-combustion with coke oven gas and natural gas in an industrial heating furnace was carried out. As a result, a significant benefit can be achieved, namely reduced production costs of the analyzed steel company by utilizing pyrolysis gas, leading to an increase in the attractiveness of the plant's products. Plastic waste and biomass are employed as energy sources in the suggested technology, therefore using them as feedstock for the pyrolysis reactor combined with the pusher type metallurgical reheating furnace is a potential proposal for the future.
