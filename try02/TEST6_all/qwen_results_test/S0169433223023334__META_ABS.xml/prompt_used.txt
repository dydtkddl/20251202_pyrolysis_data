You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineering multiple defect sites on ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride for efficiently photocatalytic conversion of lignin into monomeric aromatics via selective C–C bond scission Lignin depolymerisation via photocatalytic cleavage of the selective interunit linkage in lignin could be a sustainable approach to produce monomeric aromatic chemicals. However, the insufficient investigation of interunit C–C bond fragmentation has obstructed the rational design of efficient photocatalytic system and further limit the yields of aromatic monomers from lignin depolymerisation. Herein, this work developed the ultrathin g-C3N4 with multiple defective sites by simple self-assembly process and in-situ thermal gas-shocking/etching process to catalyse the cleavage of lignin C–C bonds under visible light irradiation. Compared with the pristine g-C3N4, the developed g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited a superior catalytic activity (improved 102 %) and selectivity (∼90 %) in the cleavage of C–C bonds in lignin. This study demonstrated that the defects construction and ultrathin structure can optimise the electronic structures of g-C3N4 for better separation and transfer of photoinduced charges. And the control experiments and DFT calculation indicated that the created defect sites can promote the generation of essential reactive radicals (e.g., the activation of O2) and radical intermediates (C–H activation). The present work provides useful insights for the rational use of defect engineering in designing the efficient photocatalytic system for the conversion of lignin into aromatic monomers via the C–C bond cleavage.
