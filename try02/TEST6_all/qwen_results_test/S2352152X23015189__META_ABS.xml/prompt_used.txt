You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel hierarchical porous carbon derived from biomass Citrus limetta pulp for high-performance quasi-solid-state supercapacitor electrodes Herein, we introduce citrus limetta pulp-derived activated carbon (AC) electrodes in high-performance symmetric electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). Dried leftover limetta pulp has been activated with varying amounts of activating agent (KHCO3) to yield a variety of activated carbons. NH4 +-salt (ammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate, NH4Tf) and ionic liquid IL (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-trifluoromethanesulfonate, EMITf) incorporated gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) interfaced with AC from the pulp have been evaluated for EDLCs' performance. Structural properties of the synthesized activated carbons have been conferred by XRD and Raman spectroscopy, whereas the morphology and the porosity have been visualized and optimized through SEM and BET analyses. Optimum characteristics of EDLCs have been depicted by the presence of micro- and mesoporosity in ACs. Free-standing film of GPE NH4Tf/IL entrapped in poly(vinylidinefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) demonstrates excellent compatibility with AC-electrodes due to their high ionic conductivity at room temperature (2.4 × 10−3 S cm−1), good electrochemical stability window (3.6 V), and flexible nature. Results elucidate that the electrochemical properties of the gel polymer electrolyte were improved by the addition of NH4 +-salt, which in turn affected the EDLCs' overall performance. By adding NH4 + the specific capacitance of the EDLC cell-2 improved from 156 F g−1 to 165 F g−1. Energy density and power density for this cell (with GPE containing NH4 +-salt) have been measured to be 25.66 Wh kg−1 and 14.35 kWkg−1, respectively. Moreover, the specific capacitance of EDLC cell-2 is retained at 80 % up to 6200 charge-discharge cycles.
