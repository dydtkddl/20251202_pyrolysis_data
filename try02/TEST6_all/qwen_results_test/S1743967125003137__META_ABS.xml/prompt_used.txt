You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal organic frameworks catalytic co-pyrolysis mechanism of waste wood and rubber for oil preparation Pyrolysis oil of waste wood exists high viscosity, poor stability, low calorific value, and low H/C ratio. The co-pyrolysis oil derived from waste wood and rubber overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks, with metal-organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs, Mg-MOFs, and Co-MOFs) serving as effective catalysts for enhancing this process. MOFs catalytic co-pyrolysis mechanism of waste wood and rubber for oil production were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Gas Chromatograph-Mass spectrograph (GC-MS), infrared flue analyzer (IFA), Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and molecular simulation. The highest oil yield (52.5 %) was achieved with the addition of Mg-MOFs. Furthermore, catalyst incorporation enhanced both the H/C ratio by over 10 % and the oil yield by at least 15 %. The MOFs catalytic co-pyrolysis mechanism of waste wood and rubber for oil preparation showed that the acid sites on Ni-MOFs and Mg-MOFs and basic sites on Co-MOFs contribute to the conversion of oxygenated compounds to phenols and aromatic hydrocarbons. MOFs catalysts effectively mitigate (>20 %) the release of harmful gases during co-pyrolysis, including volatile organic compounds (C6H6), greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2), water vapor (H2O), and acidic pollutants (SO2). Gas evolution during waste wood and rubber co-pyrolysis occurs in stages: initial dehydration releases H2O, followed by thermal decomposition yielding CO2, CH4, and C6H6, with sulfur-containing species (SO2) emitted last. These five compounds dominate the gaseous emission profile. This study can contribute to take full use of organic wastes and reduce the environmental pollution.
