You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanisms in CO2 gasification and co-gasification of combustible solid waste: A critical review Rapid population growth and industrialization have led to a global energy crisis and environmental sustainability challenges. The annual generation of vast amounts of solid waste has become an urgent environmental issue. CO2 gasification, recognized for its environmental friendliness, efficiency, and capability to produce high-value syngas, is increasingly considered a viable method for treating combustible solid waste. Given the technical and economic challenges in separating its components, this process typically involves directly gasifying the mixed combustible solid waste. The interaction of various components within this mixture adds complexity to the reaction characteristics of the CO2 gasification process. While several reviews have addressed advancements in steam co-gasification, a thorough and specialized review of CO2 co-gasification needs improvement. This work fills this gap with an in-depth review of the recent progress in CO2 gasification and co-gasification of combustible solid waste. It delves into the reactivity variances in various wastes during gasification, influenced by factors like composition, molecular structure, and the content of alkali and alkaline earth metals. The critical role of catalysts in diminishing tar formation and augmenting syngas production is underscored. Furthermore, the effects of interactions between different materials on gas yield, char reactivity, and activation energy during co-gasification were discussed. This review aims to encapsulate the potential of co-gasification technology in waste treatment and energy conversion, offering valuable insights for both academic and industrial spheres.
