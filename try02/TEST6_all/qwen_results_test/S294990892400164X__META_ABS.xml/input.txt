Mechanisms in CO2 gasification and co-gasification of combustible solid waste: A critical review Rapid population growth and industrialization have led to a global energy crisis and environmental sustainability challenges. The annual generation of vast amounts of solid waste has become an urgent environmental issue. CO2 gasification, recognized for its environmental friendliness, efficiency, and capability to produce high-value syngas, is increasingly considered a viable method for treating combustible solid waste. Given the technical and economic challenges in separating its components, this process typically involves directly gasifying the mixed combustible solid waste. The interaction of various components within this mixture adds complexity to the reaction characteristics of the CO2 gasification process. While several reviews have addressed advancements in steam co-gasification, a thorough and specialized review of CO2 co-gasification needs improvement. This work fills this gap with an in-depth review of the recent progress in CO2 gasification and co-gasification of combustible solid waste. It delves into the reactivity variances in various wastes during gasification, influenced by factors like composition, molecular structure, and the content of alkali and alkaline earth metals. The critical role of catalysts in diminishing tar formation and augmenting syngas production is underscored. Furthermore, the effects of interactions between different materials on gas yield, char reactivity, and activation energy during co-gasification were discussed. This review aims to encapsulate the potential of co-gasification technology in waste treatment and energy conversion, offering valuable insights for both academic and industrial spheres.
