You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of operating conditions on supercritical methanol liquefaction of polypropylene Plastic waste has grown at a dramatical rate over recent years, resulting in an emerging global environmental issue of white pollution. However, it also represents a potential and untapped resource for its rich carbon and hydrogen content. This work converts plastic waste into high quality oil by employing supercritical methanol. Polypropylene was liquefied at the temperature range of 330–400 °C and reacting time of 0–70 min to evaluate the effect of temperature and time on liquefaction. The results show that both increasing temperature and reaction time could promote PP conversion, thus increasing oil yield. Among parameters tested, conversion rate could achieve as high as 95.2 % at 390 °C for 70 min. Hydrocarbons and oxygenates were main compounds in the oil according to GC-MS. Reaction time led a slight difference in the oil composition while temperature led more significant variation. 72.83 % and 71.55 % of hydrocarbon in oil were obtained at 390 °C for 60 min and at 370 °C for 0 min, respectively. With temperature and time increasing, long chains were further cracked into short chains and the carbon distribution of oil became more concentrated, thus improving oil quality. These results imply that supercritical methanol could work well as a solvent to liquefy plastic into high quality oil, which provides a feasible way to solve the plastic pollution.
