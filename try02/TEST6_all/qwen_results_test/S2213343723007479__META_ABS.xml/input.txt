Effects of operating conditions on supercritical methanol liquefaction of polypropylene Plastic waste has grown at a dramatical rate over recent years, resulting in an emerging global environmental issue of white pollution. However, it also represents a potential and untapped resource for its rich carbon and hydrogen content. This work converts plastic waste into high quality oil by employing supercritical methanol. Polypropylene was liquefied at the temperature range of 330–400 °C and reacting time of 0–70 min to evaluate the effect of temperature and time on liquefaction. The results show that both increasing temperature and reaction time could promote PP conversion, thus increasing oil yield. Among parameters tested, conversion rate could achieve as high as 95.2 % at 390 °C for 70 min. Hydrocarbons and oxygenates were main compounds in the oil according to GC-MS. Reaction time led a slight difference in the oil composition while temperature led more significant variation. 72.83 % and 71.55 % of hydrocarbon in oil were obtained at 390 °C for 60 min and at 370 °C for 0 min, respectively. With temperature and time increasing, long chains were further cracked into short chains and the carbon distribution of oil became more concentrated, thus improving oil quality. These results imply that supercritical methanol could work well as a solvent to liquefy plastic into high quality oil, which provides a feasible way to solve the plastic pollution.
