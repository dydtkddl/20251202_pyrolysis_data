Fast co-pyrolysis of paper mill sludge and corn stover: Relationships between parameters, product distributions, and synergistic interactions The co-pyrolysis of paper mill sludge (PS) and biomass has attracted significant attention due to its potential for simultaneous resource utilization and waste disposal. In this work, the co-pyrolysis of PS with corn stover (CS) was carried out in a fixed bed reactor to investigate the effect of temperature and PS to CS ratio on the product characteristics. A comparison between the experimental and calculated values of product yield and composition was performed to obtain a deeper understanding of the synergistic interactions. The results exhibited a positive synergistic effect on bio-oil production at lower CS proportions with higher temperatures. Higher temperatures and lower CS proportions were favorable for the formation of aromatics (up to 45.03%) in co-pyrolysis, while the synergistic interactions promoted the production of phenols and exhibited an inhibitory effect on aromatics production. The interactions also inhibited H2 but promoted CO production due to the enhanced decarbonylation of co-pyrolysis intermediates in the presence of PS internal minerals. Additionally, the characterization of biochars indicated an increasing degree of aromaticity with higher temperatures and CS proportions. The synergistic interactions at higher temperatures facilitated the development of pore structures in the biochar, especially micropores. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between parameters, products, and synergies in the co-pyrolysis of PS and biomass wastes.
