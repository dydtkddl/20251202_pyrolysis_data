You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation of products from thermal treatment of real-world mixed single-use and multi-layered waste plastics The usage and disposal of highly abundant single-use and multilayered plastics contribute to significant ecological problems. The thermochemical recovery of these plastics to useful products and chemicals provides opportunity for positive economic and environmental impacts. Most previous research use idealised and unrepresentative feedstocks. To address this, various mixed waste plastics collected from the rejected fraction of a municipal waste recovery facility in Ghana were pyrolyzed at varying temperatures of 450, 500 and 550 °C and their yields compared. The obtained chemical products were analysed using several different techniques. Energy and carbon balances of the processes were produced using the CHNS and energy content of the oil fraction and the compositional results of the pyrolysis gas fraction, the latter of which was measured by Gas Chromatography Thermal Conductivity Detection (GC-TCD). The oils were further assessed via Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the available valuable compounds. The formed oil contained approximately 40% light hydrocarbons (C6 – C11), 18% middle hydrocarbons (C11 – C16) and 42% heavy hydrocarbon compounds (C16+). The optimal oil yield of 65.9 ± 0.5% and low heating value of 44.7 ± 0.1 MJ/kg for single-use plastics were recorded at highest heating temperatures of 550 and 500 °C, respectively. The findings provide indication that pyrolysis is a fitting solution for energy recovery from waste plastics.
