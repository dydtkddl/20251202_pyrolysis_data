You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects and comprehensive analysis of interaction during infrared co-pyrolysis of furfural residues and PVC Infrared co-pyrolysis was employed to convert waste into valuable resource due to the increasing production of plastic waste. In this study, support vector machine (SVM) accurately predicted PVC and furfural residues thermal behavior. The results showed high accuracy (R2 > 0.95) after the SVM model was trained and validated. Furthermore, this research performed an in-depth characterized of the co-pyrolysis process using various analytical techniques, indicting TG-FTIR-GC/MS, XPS, simulated distillation, and GC/MS. As the temperatures and heating rates increased, the pyrolysis oil yield increased at first and then declined, reaching a maximum of 37.7 % at 600 °C and 10 °C/s. Notably, aromatic content was relatively high, comparing with other components, whereas the chlorinated content remained relatively low, all below 6.5 %, indicating the pyrolysis oil quality had effectively improved. According to the results of XPS, there was a significant 64.11 % increase in inorganic chlorination, which suggested the effective reduction in gaseous chlorine emission and achieving chlorine immobilization.
