You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic and economic analysis of a hydrogen production process from medical waste by plasma gasification To reduce the environmental pollution caused by pathogens and radioactive substances carried by medical waste, and alleviate the shortage of non-renewable energy, this work proposes a novel overall process for hydrogen production from medical waste by plasma gasification coupled with ionic liquid-based CO2 capture. The validity of the model is verified by the experimental data. Based on the simulation results, the effects of medical waste types, different gasification agents and carbon conversion rate on the syngas compositions, H2/CO ratio, carbon conversion rate, higher heating value and exergy efficiency are explored. The results show that the rate of hydrogen production from surgical masks is more than twice that of the other two types of medical waste. Steam is the best gasification agent. At this time, the higher heating value of syngas is 26.72 MJ/kg and the exergy efficiency is 78.25%. A comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamic efficiency and technical economy of the overall process shows that the total exergy efficiency is 70.84%. The production cost is 2115.74 USD and the raw material consumption is 2.61 t/t H2. This study can provide a promising theoretical guidance for the resource treatment of medical waste.
