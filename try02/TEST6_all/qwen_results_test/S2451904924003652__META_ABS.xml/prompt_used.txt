You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Generation, Characterisation and application of hydrocarbons derived via pyrolytic conversion from Low-Density polyethylene solid waste In recent time, poor solid waste management has led to blockage of several drainages in major cosmopolitan cities. The health hazard associated with this waste is devastating especially during raining season in tropical region prone to flooding. Due to their non-biodegradable nature, low density polyethylene (LDPE) materials constitute nuisance to the environment as a result of inappropriate disposal method. This research work is geared towards ameliorating this societal menace by the generation of hydrocarbons from LDPE wastes (LDPEW) through the process pyrolysis. The LDPEW obtained from dumpsites were subjected to high temperature pyrolysis under a controlled system to generate hydrocarbons with potentials as petrochemical additives. The obtained hydrocarbons are fractionated after purification and characterisation using GC–MS. The GC–MS analysis showed that the major components of the hydrocarbons expressed in area % were; xylene (9.20) toluene (8.39), 1-butanone (7.49) cyclooctane (6.89) undecane (8.52) dodecane (6.40) 1-tridecene (5.39) decane (4.54) 1-tetradecene (3.72) benzene (2.62). The obtained physicochemical parameters of the hydrocarbons as petrochemicals are in the ranges: 0.3436–3.2719 mPas (absolute viscosity), 0.7269–3.9900 Mm2/s (kinematic viscosity), 0.7269–0.8200 g/cm3 (density) and 0.7401–08305 kg/m3 (specific gravity at 15/15 °C). It was observed that 20 % v/v blend of petrochemical additives enhance the properties of major petroleum products (PMS, Kerosene, Diesel). We envisaged that the generation of petrochemicals from LDPEW can minimize the cost of petrochemical products which have become scarce commodities due to recent unpalatable economic development in most densely populated and under-developed countries of the world.
