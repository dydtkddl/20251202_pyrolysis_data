Generation, Characterisation and application of hydrocarbons derived via pyrolytic conversion from Low-Density polyethylene solid waste In recent time, poor solid waste management has led to blockage of several drainages in major cosmopolitan cities. The health hazard associated with this waste is devastating especially during raining season in tropical region prone to flooding. Due to their non-biodegradable nature, low density polyethylene (LDPE) materials constitute nuisance to the environment as a result of inappropriate disposal method. This research work is geared towards ameliorating this societal menace by the generation of hydrocarbons from LDPE wastes (LDPEW) through the process pyrolysis. The LDPEW obtained from dumpsites were subjected to high temperature pyrolysis under a controlled system to generate hydrocarbons with potentials as petrochemical additives. The obtained hydrocarbons are fractionated after purification and characterisation using GC–MS. The GC–MS analysis showed that the major components of the hydrocarbons expressed in area % were; xylene (9.20) toluene (8.39), 1-butanone (7.49) cyclooctane (6.89) undecane (8.52) dodecane (6.40) 1-tridecene (5.39) decane (4.54) 1-tetradecene (3.72) benzene (2.62). The obtained physicochemical parameters of the hydrocarbons as petrochemicals are in the ranges: 0.3436–3.2719 mPas (absolute viscosity), 0.7269–3.9900 Mm2/s (kinematic viscosity), 0.7269–0.8200 g/cm3 (density) and 0.7401–08305 kg/m3 (specific gravity at 15/15 °C). It was observed that 20 % v/v blend of petrochemical additives enhance the properties of major petroleum products (PMS, Kerosene, Diesel). We envisaged that the generation of petrochemicals from LDPEW can minimize the cost of petrochemical products which have become scarce commodities due to recent unpalatable economic development in most densely populated and under-developed countries of the world.
