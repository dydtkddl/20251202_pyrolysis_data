You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of scCO2 techniques for surface modification of micro- and nanoparticles: Process design methodology based on solubility In order to effectively exploit the remarkable properties of fine particles to form hybrid nanostructured composites with applications in the biomedical area, one essential step is their surface functionalization. The overall objective of the present work was to use supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) for the design of the surface of inorganic particles by depositing thin and ultrathin films. Two scCO2 routes were proposed to modify the surface of micro- (SiO2, 5μm) and nanometric (TiO2, 20–30nm) oxide particles: antisolvent methods for polymers that are non-soluble in CO2 (polymethylmethacrylate), and the use of compressed CO2 as a solvent for modifiers with certain solubility in scCO2 (octadecylsilane, salicylic acid). In the antisolvent technique, solid particles were dispersed in a solution containing the polymer and mixed with scCO2; polymer precipitation, induced by the presence of CO2, occurred preferentially onto the available surface offered by the oxide particles. For CO2-soluble modifiers, the molecules were transferred from the compressed phase to the surface of the solid particles by diffusion; reactivity between adequate moieties permitted to form covalently grafted films. Vibrational ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used to evaluate potential interactions between samples components. The wettability of the produced systems was analyzed by dispersion experiments in water and toluene.
