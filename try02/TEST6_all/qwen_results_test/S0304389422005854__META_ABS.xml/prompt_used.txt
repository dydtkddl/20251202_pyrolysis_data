You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Peroxymonosulfate activation by black TiO2 nanotube arrays under solar light: Switching the activation mechanism and enhancing catalytic activity and stability Black TiO2 nanotube arrays (black TNAs) suffer from the low activity and deactivation for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, which limit their application in the oxidative destruction of organic pollutants in water. Here, we report an efficient, environmentally benign, and cost-effective method to enhance the catalytic activity and prevent the deactivation of black TNAs in PMS activation by utilizing solar energy. Optical absorption and electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that abundant oxygen vacancies (estimated to be 26%) on the black TNAs surface markedly improved solar light absorption and electrical conductivity and played a critical role as a catalytic active site for PMS activation. As a result, the solar light-irradiated black TNAs/PMS system exhibited the higher phenol degradation rate (k = 0.0488 min−1) and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency (~70%) compared to other TNAs systems. These results were ascribed to the switching of the reaction mechanism from non-radical mechanism to radical-involved. Black TNAs oxidized organic pollutants by mediating electron transfer from organics to PMS in the dark (i.e., a non-radical pathway). On the other hand, PMS activation under solar light irradiation involved the production of highly reactive sulfate and hydroxyl radicals (i.e., radical pathway), markedly improving the degradation and mineralization of organics. Additionally, the solar light-irradiated black TNAs showed relative pH-independence for PMS activation and durable catalytic performance without the loss of activity during the repetitive reaction cycles.
