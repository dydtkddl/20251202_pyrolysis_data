You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sampling strategies and analytical techniques for assessment of airborne micro and nano plastics The atmosphere is pervasively polluted by microplastics and nano plastics (M/NPs) released into indoor and outdoor areas. However, various methodologies and their limitations along with non-standardization make the comparison of information concerning their prevalence difficult. Such diversity in techniques greatly limits the interpretation of results. Herein, We extracted data from publications on PubMed and Embase database up to the year 2022 regarding sampling strategies, identification methods, and reporting data for M/NPs quantification. In this review, 5 major areas for measuring airborne M/NPs have been identified including pre-sampling/ sampling/ post-sampling/ analysis/ and contamination avoidance. There are many challenges specific to each of those sections that need to be resolved through further method development and harmonization. This review mainly focuses on the different methods for collecting atmospheric M/NPs and also the analytical tools which have been used for their identification. While passive sampling is the most user-friendly method, the most precise and reproducible approach for collecting plastic particles is an active method which is directly followed by visual counting as the most common physical analysis technique. Polymers collected using visual sorting are most frequently identified by spectroscopy (FTIR; Raman). However, destructive analytical techniques (thermal degradation) also provide precise chemical information. In all cases, the methods were screened for advantages, limitations, and fieldwork abilities. This review outlines and critiques knowledge gaps, and recommendations to support standardized and comparable future research.
