Co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyvinyl chloride under microwave irradiation: Distribution of chlorine Co-pyrolysis of sophora wood (SW) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was conducted in a microwave reactor at different temperatures and different mixing ratios, and the transformation and distribution of chlorine in pyrolysis products were investigated. Microwave pyrolysis is a simple and efficient technique with better heating uniformity and process controllability than conventional heating. Compared with PVC pyrolysis, the addition of SW significantly reduced CO2 yield and greatly increased the yield of CO. The yield and quality of pyrolysis oil were effectively improved by SW, and the content of chlorine-containing compounds in the oil was suppressed to <1% at low temperatures (<550 °C). Co-pyrolysis of SW and PVC reduced the chlorine emissions from 59.07% to 28.09% and promoted the retention of chlorine in char (from 0.33% to 4.72%). Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were co-pyrolyzed with PVC to investigate their effects on chlorine distribution. The experiments demonstrated that lignin had the most significant effects on reducing gas phase chlorine emission and achieving chlorine immobilization, and chlorine mainly existed in the form of sodium chloride in the char of lignin-PVC co-pyrolysis. Hence co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and PVC provides a practical pathway for utilization of PVC waste in an environmentally friendly manner, realizing efficient chlorine retention and significantly reducing chlorine-related emissions.
