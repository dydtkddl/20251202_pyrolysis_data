You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Verification of a porous media model for the partial oxidation of a chemically reacting fixed-bed In this work, two numerical approaches, namely particle-resolved simulations (3D PRS) and porous media model (PMM), are assessed using a 2D axisymmetric CFD pseudo-state approach (PSS) for validation of the gasification of carbon char particles in a chemically reacting fixed-bed. Simulations are performed using the commercial software Ansys® Fluent, implementing a six-reaction semi-global scheme, including three heterogeneous, and three homogeneous chemical reactions. The effects of the inflow gas temperature ( T in = 900–1500 K), mass fraction of oxygen ( Y O 2 , in = 0.05, 0.11), and laminar flow regime ( Re in = 50, 75 and 100) reveals a significant role of T in , observing important deviations at T in = 1300 K. Minimum deviations when comparing 3D PRS and 2D PMM models are observed for Y O 2 , in = 0.05, being 3.6% for CO , 5.5% for CO 2 and 0.76% for temperature inside the porous zone at different operating conditions. Thermal conductivity of the solid material, axial dispersion coefficient, and radial variation of porosity are analyzed and discussed, showing good agreement between numerical models, remarking the role of geometrical features of the unit in the gasification process.
