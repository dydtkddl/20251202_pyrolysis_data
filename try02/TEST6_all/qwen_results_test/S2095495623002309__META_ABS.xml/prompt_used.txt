You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tuning the atomic configuration environment of MnN4 sites by Co cooperation for efficient oxygen reduction Carbon-based N-coordinated Mn (Mn-N x /C) single-atom electrocatalysts are considered as one of the most desirable non-precious oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) candidates due to their insignificant Fenton reactivity, high abundance, and intriguing electrocatalytic performance. However, current Mn-N x /C single-atom electrocatalysts suffer from high overpotentials because of their low intrinsic activity and unsatisfactory chemical stability. Herein, through an in-situ polymerization-assisted pyrolysis, the Co as a second metal is introduced into the Mn-N x /C system to construct Co, Mn-N x dual-metallic sites, which atomically disperse in N-doped 1D carbon nanorods, denoted as Co, Mn-N/CNR and hereafter. Using electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, we verify the uniform dispersion of CoN4 and MnN4 atomic sites and confirm the effect of Co doping on the MnN4 electronic structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate that the energy barrier of rate-determining step (*OH desorption) decreases over the 2 N-bridged MnCoN6 moieties related to the pure MnN4. This work provides an effective strategy to modulate the local coordination environment and electronic structure of MnN4 active sites for improving their ORR activity and stability.
