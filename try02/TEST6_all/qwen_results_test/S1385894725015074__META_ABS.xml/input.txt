Advancing polyethylene pyrolysis kinetics: A tree-based kinetic Monte Carlo approach with Bayesian optimization The prevailing kinetic models for polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis often employ simplifications e.g. reduced model size to enhance computational efficiency, resulting in reduced simulation time. However, these models tend to rely on rate coefficients derived from non-ideal experimental data, characterized by uncertain process conditions concerning mixing and temperature uniformity. In this study, a tree-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model is presented and benchmarked against laboratory-scale experimental data, which distinguishes between 13 reaction families and 8 macrospecies types to predict product yields during the thermal degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The model parameters are determined through Bayesian optimization using experimental data acquired from an in-house micropyrolysis unit, coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. The presented model can accurately predict the yields in the low carbon number region of the product spectrum, which is challenging because of the high sensitivity to changes in rate coefficients compared to the high carbon number region of the product spectrum. Through comparison of the fine-tuned rate coefficient set with literature sets, certain known rate coefficient values are confirmed, highlighting the model’s reliability, while new unforeseen predictions of other rate coefficients are also offered. This indicates that the model advances the understanding of reactivities in polyethylene pyrolysis, particularly regarding hydrogen abstractions.
