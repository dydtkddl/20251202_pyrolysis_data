You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing polyethylene pyrolysis kinetics: A tree-based kinetic Monte Carlo approach with Bayesian optimization The prevailing kinetic models for polyethylene (PE) pyrolysis often employ simplifications e.g. reduced model size to enhance computational efficiency, resulting in reduced simulation time. However, these models tend to rely on rate coefficients derived from non-ideal experimental data, characterized by uncertain process conditions concerning mixing and temperature uniformity. In this study, a tree-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model is presented and benchmarked against laboratory-scale experimental data, which distinguishes between 13 reaction families and 8 macrospecies types to predict product yields during the thermal degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The model parameters are determined through Bayesian optimization using experimental data acquired from an in-house micropyrolysis unit, coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. The presented model can accurately predict the yields in the low carbon number region of the product spectrum, which is challenging because of the high sensitivity to changes in rate coefficients compared to the high carbon number region of the product spectrum. Through comparison of the fine-tuned rate coefficient set with literature sets, certain known rate coefficient values are confirmed, highlighting the model’s reliability, while new unforeseen predictions of other rate coefficients are also offered. This indicates that the model advances the understanding of reactivities in polyethylene pyrolysis, particularly regarding hydrogen abstractions.
