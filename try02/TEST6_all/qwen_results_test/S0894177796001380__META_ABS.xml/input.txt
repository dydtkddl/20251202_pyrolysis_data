Chemical reaction fouling: A review Recent research on fouling of organic fluids is renewed. Fouling in organic mixtures can be caused by numerous reactions, including autoxidation, polymerization and thermal decomposition. Understanding of autoxidation processes and their link to fouling has developed markedly in the past few years. By contrast, for fouling under non-oxidative conditions, the chemical and physical processes have not been adequately explored.
