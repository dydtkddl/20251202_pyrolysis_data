You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Intelligent optimization of solar-driven biomass-plastic co-gasification system based on limited data mapping This study proposes a solar-driven biomass-plastic co-gasification system that not only achieves efficient coupling of renewable energy sources but also promotes the clean recycling of plastic waste. Compared with biomass gasification alone, the co-gasification system can significantly increase the higher heating value and yield of combustible gas products. However, operating parameters play a decisive role in the energy utilization and carbon conversion processes of the co-gasification system. To this end, this study systematically analyzes the effects of gasification temperature, gasification agent dosage, and plastic content in the feedstock on the system's energy utilization and carbon conversion processes. Further, it explores the interactions between these parameters in these conversion processes. Building on this, a finite data mapping-based parameter optimization method is proposed and applied. The optimization results show that under optimal operating parameters, the theoretical energy utilization efficiency of the system can reach 76.2%, and the theoretical carbon conversion efficiency is 98.0%. The optimization method proposed in this study significantly reduces the computational complexity of the optimization process and greatly improves optimization efficiency. Additionally, this study not only provides new pathways for the efficient coupling and utilization of clean renewable energy but also provides technical support for the clean recycling and treatment of plastic waste.
