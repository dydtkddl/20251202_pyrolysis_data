You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing microwave-assisted production of waste-based activated carbons for the removal of antibiotics from water This work aimed at the microwave-assisted production of activated carbon (AC) from primary paper mill sludge (PS) for the adsorption of antibiotics from water. Production conditions, namely pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time and activating agent (KOH):PS ratio, were optimized as a function of product yield, specific surface area (S BET), total organic carbon (TOC) content and adsorptive removal percentage of two target antibiotics (amoxicillin (AMX) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX)). Under the optimized conditions (pyrolysis at 800 °C during 20 min and a KOH:PS ratio of 1:5), a microporous AC (MW800-20-1:5, with S BET = 1196 m2 g−1, TOC = 56.2% and removal of AMX and SMX = 85% and 72%, respectively) was produced and selected for further kinetic and equilibrium adsorption studies. The obtained results were properly described by the Elovich reaction-based kinetic model and the Langmuir equilibrium isotherm, with maximum adsorption capacities of 204 ± 5 mg g−1 and 217 ± 8 mg g−1 for AMX and SMX, respectively. Considering the satisfactory comparison of these results with the performance of commercial and alternative AC produced by conventional pyrolysis, this work demonstrated the feasibility of the microwave-assisted production of environmentally and energetically sustainable waste-based AC to be applied in the efficient removal of antibiotics from water.
