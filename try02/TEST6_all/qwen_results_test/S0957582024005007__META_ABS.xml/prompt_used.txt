You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly dispersed active sites and strong metal-support interaction for boosting CO2 hydrogenation to methanol As global energy demand continues to increase and global climate change issues caused by greenhouse gas emissions gradually heat up, the effective conversion of carbon dioxide into high value-added methanol has become a key challenge in the energy and environmental fields. However, due to the chemical inertness of CO2 molecules, it is difficult to activate CO2 at low temperatures, resulting in extremely low conversion rates. Although increasing the reaction temperature is beneficial for the conversion of CO2, there is also competition in the reverse water gas reaction, resulting in lower methanol selectivity. Therefore, developing efficient catalysts is the key to improving CO2 conversion rate and methanol selectivity. In this work, we used zirconium-based UIO-66 metal-organic framework as a precursor, replaced the original terephthalic acid ligand with thermally unstable aminoterephthalic acid, and supported Cu on the MOF precursor by equal volume impregnation method. After heat treatment, the Cu/ZrO2-DM catalyst was prepared. The catalyst was compared with Cu/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by co-precipitation method, hydrothermal method and unmodified Cu/ZrO2-D catalyst. The Cu/ZrO2-DM catalyst exhibited the highest CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity in the hydrogenation reaction, reaching 13.95% and 90.78%, respectively. The main reason is attributed to the large specific surface area of the copper-based catalyst derived from MOF materials, the good dispersion of the active center and the strong interaction between Cu and the precursor. This work may provide a new perspective for the design and synthesis of related catalytic materials for efficient CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.
