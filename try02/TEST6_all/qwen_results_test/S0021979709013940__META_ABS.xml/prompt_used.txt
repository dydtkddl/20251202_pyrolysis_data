You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Scavenging H2S(g) from oil phases by means of ultradispersed sorbents Ultradispersed catalysts significantly enhance rates of reaction and mass transfer by virtue of their extended and easy accessible surface. These attractive features were exploited in this study to effectively capture H2S(g) from an oil phase by ultradispersed sorbents. Sorption of H2S(g) from oil phases finds application for scavenging H2S(g) forming during heavy oil extraction and upgrading. This preliminary investigation simulated heavy oil by (w/o) microemulsions having 1-methyl-naphthalene; a high boiling point hydrocarbon, as the continuous phase. H2S(g) was bubbled through the microemulsions which contained the ultradispersed sorbents. The type and origin of sorbent were investigated by comparing in situ prepared FeOOH and commercial α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as well as aqueous FeCl3 and NaOH solutions dispersed in the (w/o) microemulsions. The in situ prepared FeOOH nanoparticles captured H2S(g) in a chemically inactive form and displayed the highest sorption rate and capacity. Temperature retarded the performance of FeOOH particles, while mixing had no significant effect.
