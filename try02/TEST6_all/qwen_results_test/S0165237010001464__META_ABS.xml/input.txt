Pyrolysis of methane by catalytic properties exhibited by ceramics The present work describes the synthesis of modified ceramics which have been designed for pyrolysis of methane to produce pure hydrogen and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Results have been compared with that of supported nickel catalyst. The use of ceramics as catalysts offers advantages over metal catalysts as the reaction can be controlled for the production of specific products. We have reported the catalytic activity and stability of ceramic materials, designed for methane decomposition reaction. The main focus of this work is to expand the scope of ceramics material and to gain further understanding of the nature of the catalytic action of these materials.
