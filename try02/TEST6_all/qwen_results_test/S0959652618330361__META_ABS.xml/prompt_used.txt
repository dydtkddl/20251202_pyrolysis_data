You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading of Scenedesmus obliquus oil to high-quality liquid-phase biofuel by nickel-impregnated biochar catalyst This work investigated the optimization of process parameters in the upgrading of the oil extracted from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae using a novel nickel-impregnated biochar catalyst. The effects of temperature, dodecane-to-oil mass ratio and pressure on the upgraded liquid-phase biofuel yield were evaluated and optimized by central composite design of the response surface methodology (RSM). The model equation generated from RSM showed that dodecane-to-oil mass ratio and pressure, as well as the quadratic effects of all the three factors, were significant model terms in predicting the yield of upgraded liquid-phase biofuel. Maximum liquid biofuel yield was attained at 246.89 °C, 3.72 (w/w) dodecane-to-oil mass ratio, 3.84 MPa hydrogen pressure and 6 h processing time. Validation runs resulted in an upgraded biofuel yield of 69.4%, which was in close agreement with predicted values generated by RSM. The upgraded biofuel comprised of 100% green liquid hydrocarbons containing 94% alkanes and 6% alkenes. Its main fuel properties, such as heating value (43.78 MJ kg−1), elemental composition, density, and viscosity, exceeded those of the fatty acid methyl ester standard and were found comparable to those of petroleum diesel. More importantly, the results of the ultimate analysis and confirmed by the findings from Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy analyses, showed significantly low oxygen and nitrogen content and absence of sulfur in the upgraded biofuel.
