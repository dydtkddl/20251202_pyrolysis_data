You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable production of aromatic-rich biofuel via catalytic co-pyrolysis of lignin and waste polyoxymethylene over commercial Al2O3 catalyst Co-valorization of biomass and multiple solid wastes is essential to environment protection and energy security. Herein, aromatic-rich biofuel was produced from lignin and waste polyoxymethylene (POM) via catalytic co-pyrolysis process. Commercial and cheap γ-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited good catalytic performance. Series characterizations and bench-top pyrolysis experiments were conducted to illustrate the synergism between raw materials and the mechanism of aromatics formation. The TG analysis and thermodynamics calculation revealed that a remarkably positive synergistic effect existed between lignin and POM, which reduce the activation energies and make the reaction more conducive in terms of thermodynamics. Meanwhile, the yields of biochar and bio-oil increased considerably. Additionally, the operating conditions affected the product distributions significantly. The suitable mixing ratio of lignin to POM was around equal (5:5) with the bio-oil yield increased to 28.3 % and aromatic hydrocarbons selectivity increased to > 95 %. Moreover, POM, the precursor for alkylating reagents and hydrogen donors, could promote the deoxygenation reactions of phenolic intermediates and result into aromatic hydrocarbons. The acid sites of γ-Al2O3 promoted series secondary cracking reactions (alkylation, deoxygenation), and thus improved bio-oil quality. Finally, the stability test showed that commercial γ-Al2O3 catalyst was slightly deactivated after 4 cycles because of coke deposits and acid sites loss.
