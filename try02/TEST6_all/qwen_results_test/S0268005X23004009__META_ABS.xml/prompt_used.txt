You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam explosion pretreatment for bovine limed hide waste gelatin extraction It is of great interest to find fast, effective, and less environmental impact methods for gelatin extraction. This work aimed to extract gelatin from limed bovine hide wastes (LBHW) after steam explosion (SE) pretreatment, with subsequent purification using ultrafiltration membranes. The SE pretreatment was studied at 110, 120, and 130 °C for 1, 5, and 10 min. Afterwards, the gelatins were extracted in water at 65 °C and characterized. Gelatin solutions were purified on ultrafiltration membranes with and without enzymatic treatment using 2.5% (w/w) transglutaminase. Temperature and extraction time were significant for all variables studied. SE pretreatment at 120 °C/10min and 130 °C/10min showed higher protein content and viscosity, as well as lower ash content and pH. Gelatin's molecular weight distribution increased with higher time and temperature conditions (30–69 kDa). Purification in ultrafiltration membranes reduced the ash content of gelatin solutions up to 90% after two diafiltrations. Although protein loss during diafiltrations was inevitable, the enzymatic treatment increased the molecular weight distribution by up to 9 times of purified gelatins. Overall, steam explosion proved to be a promising alternative pretreatment for gelatin extraction in a shorter time and without total protein degradation.
