You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam reforming of n-hexane and toluene: Understanding impacts of structural difference of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons on their coking behaviours Plastic wastes are potential feedstock for the production of hydrogen via gasification. Aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons are important fractions from pyrolysis of plastic wastes, which might show the different reaction behaviors in steam reforming reactions due to their distinct molecular structures. To explore this, in this study, steam reforming of n-hexane and toluene, two model compounds representing respective aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons, over Ni/SBA-15 catalyst were carried out. The in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization of the steam reforming indicated that the dissociative absorption of n-hexane on nickel took place even at 100 °C, form abundant CHx species and consequently more CH4 in gaseous products. Nevertheless, the reaction intermediates from n-hexane could be gasified by the OH from adsorbed water rapidly. In comparison, the fragments from dissociative adsorption of toluene reacted with hydroxyl group of water, forming the stable intermediates bearing OH, CO, COC and CC functionalities, which were the precursors of coke and resulted in more serious coking. The coke from steam reforming of toluene showed a higher thermal stability, higher resistivity to oxidation as it was more aromatic and contained more defective with big fused ring structures. In addition, the majority carbon nanotubes generated during steam reforming of toluene had an inner diameter of 3–6 nm and outer diameter of 10–20 nm. Nickel species on tip of the nanotubes were wrapped with a carbon layer, which contributed to the deactivation of the catalyst in steam reforming of toluene.
