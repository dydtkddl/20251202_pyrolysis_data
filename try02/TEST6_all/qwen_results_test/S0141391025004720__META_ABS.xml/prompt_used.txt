You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From frameworks to firewalls: metal-organic frameworks as smart additives for flame-retardant polymers The increasing demand for polymeric materials that can be ‘safe’ during fire and combustion scenarios has led to a drive in the investigation of advanced flame-retardant systems that are both effective and environmentally friendly. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a group of porous crystalline materials made up of metal centres (nodes) and organic linkers, have, in this case, shown great promise as multifunctional additives. This review investigates the role of MOFs in improving thermal and mechanical stability, catalytic properties, and flame retardancy of various polymer matrices. Different metal classes have shown to possess different properties that help in the improvement of polymeric materials’ flame retardance properties. Both transition metals (TM) and rare earth (RE) metals have been employed in MOFs, and studies show that TM exhibit higher thermal stability, thereby helping to prevent polymer degradation, whereas RE metals improve char formation and smoke suppression. Emphasis is also placed on the synergistic influence of metal selection, synthesis and the mechanisms by which MOFs increase Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) values and improve Underwriters Laboratories (UL 94) tests, reducing heat release and material degradation during combustion. Through critically analyzing recent experimental findings and promising trends, this work highlights MOFs as leading additives in the creation of high-performance flame-retardant (FR) polymer composites.
