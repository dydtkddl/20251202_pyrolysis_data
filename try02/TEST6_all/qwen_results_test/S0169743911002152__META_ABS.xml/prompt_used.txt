You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A statistical data-processing methodology of Py–GC/MS data for the simulation of flash co-pyrolysis reactor experiments Practically it is extremely difficult to collect observations following a fully sound statistical design, typically encompassing a high number of repetitions, of an intensive and elaborate experimental procedure such as flash pyrolysis reactor experiments. Pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py–GC/MS) is an extremely useful analytical technique in order to simulate a high number of repetitive pyrolysis experiments in an acceptable time span. Combining Py–GC/MS experiments and statistical data processing, conclusions can be drawn on the pyrolysis behaviour of any input material, supplying crucial information on its respective behaviour during the actual flash pyrolysis experiments. In this research Py–GC/MS experiments combined with a tailored statistical data processing methodology strongly indicate the occurrence of synergetic interactions during the flash co-pyrolysis of willow/polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) blends. Such interactions are also indicated by pattern recognition and by the analysis of the condensable and noncondensable pyrolytic gases obtained from Py–GC/MS. Accordingly, the actual influence of the flash co-pyrolysis of willow and PHB, executed with a semi-continuous pyrolysis reactor, on the pyrolytic oil features is investigated by GC/MS. Based on these experiments an explanation for the observed synergy during flash co-pyrolysis of willow and PHB is proposed.
