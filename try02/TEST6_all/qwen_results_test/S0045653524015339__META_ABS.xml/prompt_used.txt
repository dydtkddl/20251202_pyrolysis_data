You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergism of floated paperboard sludge cake /sewage sludge for maximizing biomethane yield and biochar recovery from digestate: A step towards circular economy Anaerobic digestion of floated paperboard sludge (PS) cake suffers from volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation, nutrient unbalanced condition, and generation of digestate with a risk of secondary pollution. To overcome these drawbacks, sewage sludge (SS) was added to PS cake for biogas recovery improvement under a co-digestion process followed by the thermal treatment of solid fraction of digestate for biochar production. Batch experimental assays were conducted at different SS:PS mixing ratios of 70:30, 50:50, 30:70, and 20:80 (w/w), and their anaerobic co-digestion performances were compared to the mono-digestion systems at 35 ± 0.2 °C for 45 days. The highest methane yield (MY) of 241.68 ± 14.81 mL/g CODremoved was obtained at the optimum SS:PS ratio of 50:50 (w/w). This experimental condition was accompanied by protein, carbohydrate, and VFA conversion efficiencies of 47.3 ± 3.2%, 46.8 ± 3.2%, and 56.3 ± 3.8%, respectively. The synergistic effect of SS and PS cake encouraged the dominance of Bacteroidota (23.19%), Proteobacteria (49.65%), Patescibacteria (8.12%), and Acidovorax (12.60%) responsible for hydrolyzing the complex organic compounds and converting the VFAs into biomethane. Further, the solid fraction of digestate was subjected to thermal treatment at a temperature of 500 °C for 2.0 h, under an oxygen-limited condition. The obtained biochar had a yield of 0.48 g/g dry digestate, and its oxygen-to-carbon (O/C), carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N), and carbon-to-phosphorous (C/P) ratios were 0.55, 10.23, and 16.42, respectively. A combined anaerobic co-digestion/pyrolysis system (capacity 50 m3/d) was designed based on the COD mass balance experimental data and biogenic CO2 market price of 22 USD/ton. This project could earn profits from biogas (12,565 USD/yr), biochar (6641 USD/yr), carbon credit (8014 USD/yr), and COD shadow price (6932 USD/yr). The proposed project could maintain a payback period of 6.60 yr. However, further studies are required to determine the associated life cycle cost model that is useful to validate the batch experiment assumptions.
