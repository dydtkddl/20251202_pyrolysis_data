You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Response surface methodology optimized co-pyrolysis of mixed date seeds and chicken bones for bio-oil production Background Co-pyrolysis of date seeds (DS) and chicken bone (CB) mixture in a fixed bed reactor to produce pyrolytic oil (PO). The process was adjusted using Central Composite Design (CCD) followed by Response surface methodology (RSM) to produce an optimal PO yield. Methods To evaluate the pattern and relation between the experimental responses and the process variables, the variables, including temperature (400 °C - 600 °C), feedstock particle size (0.15–0.35 mm), heating rate (10–50 °C/min), and time (40–80 min), were investigated. Significant Findings The extreme output of the PO was 65.11 % and was produced at 500 °C using a 0.25 mm particle size and a heating rate of 30 °C/min for 60 min. Quantifying the bio-oil (BO) by GC–MS analysis showed the BO consisted mostly of oxygenated hydrocarbons (73.16 %), including acids (64.16 %), aldehydes and ketone (4.45 %), esters (4.20 %), and alcohols (0.35 %). Other components included hydrocarbons (33.84 % (paraffin, 16.89 %; olefines, 16.3 %; and alkynes, 0.65 %)) and nitrogen compounds (5.79 %). In conclusion, the mixed DSCB can be used as a resource for pyrolysis and produce a complex mixture of acids, esters, and alkanes.
