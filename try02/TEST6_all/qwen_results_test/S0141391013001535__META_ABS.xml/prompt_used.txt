You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidative degradation products analysis of polymer materials by pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry Pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (PGC–MS) has been proved to be a powerful method to analyze both the volatile additives and the macromolecular structure of polymer materials. In this paper, flash evaporation technique was used to analyze the volatile degradation products of polymer materials during natural and artificial aging. In high density polyethylene (HDPE) composites, mainly n-alkanes with carbon number from 14 to 29 were detected after natural aging, while no oxidative product was found. Different composites have different n-alkane distributions. In contrast, various oxidative products including ketones, alcohols, esters and unsaturated species could be found in aged polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites. Nanoparticles accelerated the chain scission of PP and increased the formation of oxidative products significantly. During thermal oxidation of nitrile rubber (NBR) seal rubbers, heat/oxidation-induced extra crosslinking predominated and no volatile degradation products was detected. The main change happened in the volatiles is the decrease of additives, especially paraffins, antioxidant RD and hindered phenol. This resulted in the hardening of the rubber and the weakening of the protection from oxidation. Furthermore, the additive distribution along the depth was investigated, showing different migration speeds of different additives. From the additive levels remained in the NBR rubber, it is possible to predict the degradation status. In summary, PGC–MS can supply abundant information of polymer degradation and is helpful for mechanism research.
