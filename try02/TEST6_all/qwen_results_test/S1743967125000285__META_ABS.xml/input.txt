Study on the two-stage co-pyrolysis characteristics of Marine waste poypropylene and Enteromorpha A thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor were utilized to investigate the two-stage co-pyrolysis characteristics of mixed waste polypropylene (PP) and enteromorpha (EP). The thermogravimetric characteristics, kinetics, and synergistic effects were analyzed. The influence of temperature on the product distribution of the two-stage co-pyrolysis of PP and EP was elucidated. The results indicated a significant synergistic effect between EP and PP at 200–500 °C, with the pyrolysis reaction mechanism identified as a phase transition boundary reaction. Compared to the single-stage co-pyrolysis, the two-stage co-pyrolysis increased the yield of pyrolysis oil. As the first-stage pyrolysis temperature increased, the total oil yield of two-stage co-pyrolysis initially rose and then declined, peaking at 40.25 % at 550 °C. The aromatic content of the oil from the second stage was significantly higher than that from the first stage and the single-stage co-pyrolysis. Increasing the first-stage pyrolysis temperature enhanced the aromatic content while reduced the oxygen and nitrogen compound contents. Additionally, increasing the first-stage pyrolysis temperature promoted the cracking of volatiles, resulting in more gas products, with a notable increase in CH4 and H2 content. The char yield decreased, while the degree of aromatization and densification of the char was enhanced by the higher first-stage pyrolysis temperature.
