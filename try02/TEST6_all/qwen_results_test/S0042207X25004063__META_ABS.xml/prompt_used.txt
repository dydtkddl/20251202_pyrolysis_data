You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Joule-heating vacuum carbothermal reduction process for efficient and cleaner production of magnesium The vacuum carbothermal reduction (VCTR) method is emerging as a promising and profitable technology for the preparation of metal magnesium (Mg). However, the conventional VCTR method is energy-intensive and time-consuming due to the separation of the operating steps and sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, we developed a one-step Joule heating vacuum carbothermal reduction (OJHVCTR) method for the preparation of metal Mg directly from dolomite. The experimental parameters including vacuum conditions, C/MgO molar ratio, power density and reaction times are optimized. And a MgO reduction rate of 90.7 % can be achieved within 3.2 min at a C/MgO molar ratio of 3:1 and a power density of 0.46 W mm−3 in 10 Pa. Contrast experiment and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that the rapid reaction can be ascribed to the enhancement of C atoms diffusion due to the electric field in the OJHVCTR method. Importantly, life-cycle assessment proves that compared to the Pidgeon method and the conventional VCTR method, the novel method can reduce energy consumption by 58 % and 6 % as well as GHG emissions by 58 % and 77 %, respectively. These results suggest that the new method can provide an efficient and cleaner alternative for metal Mg production, which is of great significance for structuring a carbon-neutral society with a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system.
