You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of thermal properties and analysis of combustion behavior of PMMA in a cone calorimeter This paper deals with the thermal degradation of a black poly(methyl)methacrylate (PMMA) in a cone calorimeter (CC) in air with a piloted ignition. The influence of several heat fluxes (11kWm−2 and 12kWm−2, and ten values from 15 to 60kWm−2 in steps of 5kWm−2) on PMMA sample degradation and the decomposition chemistry has been studied. Thus, thermal properties have been deduced and calculated from ignition time and mass loss rate (MLR) curves. During our experiments, among compounds quantified simultaneously by a Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) or gas analyzer, five main species (CO2, CO, H2O, NO and O2) have been encountered, regardless of the external heat flux considered. The main product concentrations allow calculation of the corresponding emission yields. Thus, mass balances of C and H atoms contained in these exhaust gases were able to be compared with those included in the initial PMMA sample. Using the standard oxygen consumption method, heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR) and effective heat of combustion (EHC) have been calculated for each irradiance level. Therefore, these different results (thermal properties, emission yields, HRR, THR and EHC) are in quite good accordance (same order of magnitude) with those found in previous studies.
