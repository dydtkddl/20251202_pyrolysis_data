You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards sustainability via recycling solar photovoltaic Panels, A review Human activities are placing a progressively increasing demand on energy consumption. Renewable energy resources are a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to their sustainability. There has been lately an immense growth in the application of several renewable energy resources, including solar energy, where the abundance of waste solar panels is becoming challenging. Solar panels have a shelf life from 20 to 30 years. Photovoltaic panels modules consist of both valuable and toxic materials that might possess harm to the human wellbeing and to the environment if not disposed appropriately. These days, research to recover solar photovoltaic panels is confronting several difficulties, beside that there is an urge to design an economically non-toxic, easy, and feasible technologies for their recovery. The end-of-life solar panels’ appropriate management is just at the beginning in several places in the world, besides that there is a demand for the producers’ responsibilities towards the issue. The disassembly and recyclability of the end-of-life solar cells is not really deliberated because of the deficiency of solar panels recycling plants worldwide. Recyclability of the expired solar cells can decrease the production cost of new systems. This review article discusses the synthesis of solar panels, with a detailed description for its different parts. Recycling systems for photovoltaic wastes are elaborately discussed along with addressing the adverse environmental issues of the huge quantities of solar panels wastes besides providing a detailed basis for supporting recycling of solar panels. Lastly, the policies and regulations for solar panel recycling is also considered.
