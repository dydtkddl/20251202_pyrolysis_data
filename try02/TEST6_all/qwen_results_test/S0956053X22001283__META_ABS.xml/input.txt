Hydrothermal processing of polyethylene-terephthalate and nylon-6 mixture as a plastic waste upcycling treatment: A comprehensive multi-phase analysis Accumulation of plastic waste is harming eco-systems and it is time to move towards a circular plastic economy. Sustainable production and recycling processes for plastics are challenged mostly by the lack of renewable building blocks. This study investigates hydrothermal processing (HTP) as a platform for depolymerization of two commonly used plastic polymers. Subcritical water (300 °C; 10 MPa) was tested as a solvent to treat polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and nylon-6 individually and in a mixture for a short reaction time of 90 min. Monomer recovery, gaseous emissions, and the effect of polymer mixture were evaluated by comprehensive analyses of all reaction products. Terephthalic acid (TPA), one of two monomers of PET was recovered as a solid product with a mass yield of 75%. ε-caprolactam (CPL), the single monomer of nylon-6 was recovered as a liquid product with a mass yield of 92.5%. Following PET + nylon-6 co-processing, TPA recovery decreased by 20%, whereas CPL recovery was not affected. Since TPA and CPL were recovered in different phases, an easy separation can likely be created for co-processing of PET and nylon-6. While most HTP studies neglect analysis of the gas phase, acetaldehyde and cyclopentene emissions were detected during HTP of PET and nylon-6, respectively. As shown here, gaseous emissions, which may be toxic, should be addressed in future developments of HTP for plastics. The results presented here can contribute to developing HTP processes for plastic recycling, that will be part of a circular plastic economy and a more sustainable future.
