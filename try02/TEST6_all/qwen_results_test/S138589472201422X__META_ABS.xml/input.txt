Microwave-combined advanced oxidation for organic pollutants in the environmental remediation: An overview of influence, mechanism, and prospective Microwave technology, with its fast, uniform, and high controllability, has become a research hotspot in the field of environmental remediation owing to its unique heating mode (thermal and non-thermal effects). Moreover, microwave radiation stimulates the generation of “hot spots” on the catalyst surface, accelerating the cracking of pollutants. This paper reviews the treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater, sludge, and soil using a microwave-combined advanced oxidation system. The influence of the microwave reactor, type of catalyst, and its dose on the microwave-combined advanced oxidation process was investigated. The mechanism and applications of microwave irradiation combined with typical advanced oxidation processes (persulfate, hydrogen peroxide oxidation, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, etc.) to treat organic pollutants are discussed. A theoretical analysis of the cost estimate of the microwave system shows that reasonable microwave system parameters could offer more cost savings than traditional treatment methods. Finally, the application prospects and related problems of the microwave-combined advanced oxidation system in organic pollution control were systematically discussed.
