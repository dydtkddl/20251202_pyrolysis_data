You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of carbon nanotubes on thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene and polypropylene The goal of this work is to analyze the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the pyrolysis of either high density polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) matrices by using both kinetic thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under non-isothermal conditions and a fixed-bed reactor under isothermal conditions. Under non-isothermal conditions, CNTs increased the beginning of thermodegradation for both matrices with differences as high as 30 °C and 22 °C as compared with neat PP and PE, respectively. This enhanced thermal stability in PP based composites was associated with an increase in the apparent activation energy whereas in PE based composites lower pre-exponential factors associated with reduced conformational entropy, are responsible for the enhanced thermal stability. The thermodecomposition processes were studied by assuming geometrical contraction and nucleation models. The invariant pre-exponential factor and apparent activation energy obtained were quantified for each sample confirming that these values depended on the polymer matrix and concentration of CNTs. These invariant parameters were in good agreement with those obtained by isoconversional analyses allowing the prediction of the thermogravimetric behavior. Our findings clearly showed the strong effect of CNTs on the non-isothermal pyrolysis of polymer materials changing its kinetic and the activation energy. Results from isothermal pyrolysis (450 °C-40′) confirmed the thermal stability by the presence of CNTs as higher condensable (C9–C40) and lower gas (C1–C4) yields in PP-CNTs composites, and a higher amount of unreacted polymer and a lower both condensable and gas yields for PE-CNT, as compared with the pure matrix, were found.
