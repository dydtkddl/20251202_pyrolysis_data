Analyze the mechanism of separating resin and glass fiber from the main beam material of retired wind turbine blades during the process of vacuum melting-gasification-decomposition-condensation The resource utilization of retired wind turbine blades is a key part of achieving the “dual carbon” goal. It is difficult to separate the adhesion between glass fiber and thermosetting resin in the main beam material of retired wind turbine blades, and the presence of thermosetting resin affects the recycling of glass fiber. The current separation technology has problems such as high technical difficulty and low availability of recycled products. In this study, it was verified that the vacuum melting-gasification-decomposition-condensation method could effectively separate glass fiber and thermosetting resin, and the thermosetting resin condensed in the pipe. The average heat release rate during decomposition is 48.26 kW/m2, and the heat treatment process is easy to control. The reaction sites were calculated and simulated by quantum chemistry, and the bond breaking energies of the thermosetting resin were 378.98 kJ/mol, 393.92 kJ/mol and 352.67 kJ/mol, respectively. The simulation results combined with the thermal decomposition characteristics show that the separation process goes through four parts: vacuum melting, gasification, decomposition and condensation. In addition, the material has a Young’s modulus of 33946.76 MPa, and has strong toughness and potential for recycling. This paper may be the first study to recycle glass fibers using vacuum melting-gasification-decomposition-condensation technology.
