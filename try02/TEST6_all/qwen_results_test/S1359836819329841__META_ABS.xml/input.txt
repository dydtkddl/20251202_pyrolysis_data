Atomization of cellulose nanocrystals aqueous suspensions in fused deposition modeling: A scalable technique to improve the strength of 3D printed polymers 3D printed polymer parts remain too low in mechanical performance that inhibits their industrial applications. We introduce a novel and scalable technique to enhance the strength of 3D printed polymer parts. We incorporate cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) between adjacent layers of polymer with the aid of an atomization process integrated within a fused deposition modeling printer to spray aqueous suspensions of CNC during the printing process. CNCs act as nano-stitches between the polymer layers and thus improve the interlayer adhesion and ultimate strength of the printed parts. We show that spraying aqueous suspension of CNC with 0.5–1 wt% concentrations increase the interlayer strength of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) parts by 44%, tensile strength by 33%, tensile modulus by 20% and the toughness by 33% in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Increasing CNC concentration above 1 wt%, however, results in CNC agglomerates between layers, which negatively affects the interlayer adhesion and reduces the ultimate strength. Non-toxicity of CNC and water and hydrophilicity of CNC leverage the scalability of this method.
