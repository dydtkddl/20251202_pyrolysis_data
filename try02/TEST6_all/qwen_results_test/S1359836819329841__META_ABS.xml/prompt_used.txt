You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atomization of cellulose nanocrystals aqueous suspensions in fused deposition modeling: A scalable technique to improve the strength of 3D printed polymers 3D printed polymer parts remain too low in mechanical performance that inhibits their industrial applications. We introduce a novel and scalable technique to enhance the strength of 3D printed polymer parts. We incorporate cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) between adjacent layers of polymer with the aid of an atomization process integrated within a fused deposition modeling printer to spray aqueous suspensions of CNC during the printing process. CNCs act as nano-stitches between the polymer layers and thus improve the interlayer adhesion and ultimate strength of the printed parts. We show that spraying aqueous suspension of CNC with 0.5–1 wt% concentrations increase the interlayer strength of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) parts by 44%, tensile strength by 33%, tensile modulus by 20% and the toughness by 33% in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Increasing CNC concentration above 1 wt%, however, results in CNC agglomerates between layers, which negatively affects the interlayer adhesion and reduces the ultimate strength. Non-toxicity of CNC and water and hydrophilicity of CNC leverage the scalability of this method.
