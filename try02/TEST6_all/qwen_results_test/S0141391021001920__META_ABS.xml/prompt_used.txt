You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis mechanism of phenylboronic acid modified phenolic resin Phenylboronic acid (PBA) modified phenolic resin (PBPR) is one of the most important phenolic resins (PR) due to its good processability and high char yield. However, the pyrolysis mechanisms of PR and PBPR still remain poorly understood, which imposes limits on the synthesis, development and application of these materials. In this work, the pyrolysis process of PBPR has been studied through novolac resin (NR) and PBA crosslinked NR (PBNR) at high temperatures, and the reasons for the high char yield of PBPR were explored, as well. According to the results, the pyrolysis of NR begins with the cleavage reaction of the covalent single bonds in the molecular backbone. The release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as monophenols and bisphenols formed by the cleavage of C—C single bonds is the major cause of the decreased char yield of NR at elevated temperatures. Meanwhile, increasing NR molecular weight and crosslinking NR could reduce the formation probability of VOCs, which is beneficial to obtaining the high char yield resin. In PBPR, the boronic ester linkages make the formation of VOCs more difficult and contribute to the high char yield of resin. The present work provides guiding significance for deeply understanding the pyrolysis mechanism of PR and PBPR to ensure their high thermal stability and char yield at high temperatures.
