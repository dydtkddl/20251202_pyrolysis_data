You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Printing 3D metallic structures through reduction processes: principle, approaches, and applications 3D printing holds significant promise for the fabrication of functional metal structures in various applications. This is made possible due to the unique properties of metals such as electrical conductivity, electrochemical activity, and catalytic behavior. However, existing methods are hampered by critical limitations. Traditional approaches often require high-temperature sintering and yield conductivities inferior to those of bulk metals. Similarly, existing direct writing techniques face challenges in achieving both fine feature control and high throughput, while mainstream metal 3D printing operates at resolutions too coarse for delicate electronics and metallic micro-/nanostructures. This review addresses these gaps by exploring reduction-based 3D printing strategies, where metal-containing precursors are directly transformed into conductive metals via reduction processes. By systematically examining five cutting-edge approaches, namely reactive ink printing, electroless plating of 3D printed structures, metal precursor printing followed by thermal reduction, in situ photoreduction-based laser fabrication, and electrochemical printing, this work elucidates the underlying reduction mechanisms, energetic considerations, and material behaviours that allows for the fabrication of metallic structures with either enhanced resolution, reduced thermal budget, or both. By unifying insights across these methods, the review outlines a roadmap for overcoming current limitations and advancing integration, resolution, and scalability in future applications of 3D-printed metallic materials.
