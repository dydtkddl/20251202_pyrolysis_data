You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

RSM optimization of microwave pyrolysis parameters to produce OPS char with high yield and large BET surface area Microwave pyrolysis is a very effective technique to convert organic waste into energy rich products. In the present work micro porous and carbonaceous OPS char was synthesized by microwave pyrolysis technique. OPS char yield and its BET surface area was investigated as a function of process parameters to make the microwave pyrolysis of OPS more efficient. Both of these quantities were found to be affected by the process parameters. With the rise in microwave power (MWP) and radiation time (RT), OPS char yield was lowered while increase N2 flow rate (NFR) increased the OPS char yield slightly. Extreme values of either of the process parameter was seen to lower the BET surface area of OPS char. Response Surface Methodology (RSM), was used to optimize the process parameters for maximized OPS char yield and its BET surface area. Regression models for the OPS char yield and its BET surface area were also developed in this study. These regression models were having high Fischer test value & lower p-value which ensure its reliability and applicability. ANOVA analysis of the experimental data provided the process parameters to achieve maximized OPS char yield (60.93%) and BET surface area (250.03 m2/g). The predicted results were validated and it was found that the experimental data varied only by 5.99% in yield and 6.34% in BET surface area from the predicted values.
