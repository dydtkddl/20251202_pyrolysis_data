You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ciprofloxacin desorption from gel type ion exchange resin: Desorption modeling in batch system and fixed bed column The aim of this paper was to assess the desorption of ciprofloxacin (CIP) from the Supergel™ SGC650H resin and to evaluate the possibility of future reuse of the adsorbent by applying adsorption cycles. Preliminary desorption tests by using different aqueous HCl concentrations as eluent agents and adsorption experiments with the previously treated resin with these same solutions were carried out in batch system to determine the best eluent condition. Physico-chemical characterization tests were performed for virgin and HCl-treated resin, evidencing changes on the resin’s structure and functional groups caused by the eluents. The preliminary results showed that the HCl concentration of 2 mol L−1 provided both the CIP-desorption efficiency from the resin and the improvement of CIP adsorption capacity. Therefore, this eluent concentration was applied for the further equilibrium experiments in batch system. Mathematical modeling was applied to the kinetic and equilibrium desorption data obtained in batch system, evidencing that internal diffusion model showed a good agreement with the experimental data. Based on the estimated parameters from the independent batch experiments, the model was able to adequately predict the desorption kinetic behavior in fixed bed column. Overall, the results showed that the HCl aqueous solution of 2 mol L−1 could be efficiently applied to assess adsorption cycles, due to the high desorption efficiency combined with the enhancement of the resin’s capacity. Furthermore, the present work provided a robust and predictive mathematical model, which could support the design and the scale up of industrial level equipment.
