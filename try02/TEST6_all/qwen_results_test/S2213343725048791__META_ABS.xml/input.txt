Prediction and analysis of polyvinylidene fluoride membrane pyrolysis reaction based on machine learning framework This study developed a machine learning-based pyrolysis model to predict the product yields of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Among the evaluated algorithms, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm demonstrated superior performance and was selected as the optimal model. The developed RF model exhibited high predictive accuracy, achieving a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.947, indicating that more than 94.7 % of the variance in product yield was explained. Feature importance analysis, employing both Pearson correlation and SHAP methods, revealed that the elemental composition of the feedstock provided the most significant contribution (45.76 %) to the pyrolysis product distribution. Experimental validation confirmed the model's robustness, with predicted yields for PVDF pyrolysis showing excellent agreement with actual experimental results, achieving an overall accuracy exceeding 92.6 %. This work provides valuable insights and a reliable predictive framework for modeling the pyrolysis behavior of PVDF and related fluoropolymers.
