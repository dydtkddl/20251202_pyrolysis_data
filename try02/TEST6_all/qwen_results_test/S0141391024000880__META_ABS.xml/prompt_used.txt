You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Alkali hydrolysis of wool fibres using microwave irradiation as a recycling approach for handling wool-waste The aim of the present work is to investigate the influence of microwave irradiation on alkali hydrolysis, under various thermochemical conditions, of wool fibres. This perspective seems to be a promising alternative for the valorization of wool waste. The reaction yield is calculated in every case in order to determine the optimum hydrolysis conditions. The solid residue, as well as the filtrate, are subjected to instrumental chemical analysis in order to identify and isolate useful products. The optimal conditions for the hydrolysis of wool resulted to be the use of 5% w/v NaOH, microwave treatment for 10 min in absence of phase-transfer catalyst. In addition, the analysis in the Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) allowed the identification of certain small molecules like N2, H2S, NH3, C6H5OH, C4H9NO and larger ones like amino acids, such as alanine, cystine, proline, valine and leucine. Additionally, the content of wool hydrolysate was specified upon identifying several substituted products of tyrosine, proline and alanine amino acids. Liquid Chromatography–Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC–Orbitrap HRMS) was also employed to identify the components present in the wool hydrolysate, detecting mainly various dipeptides as well as leucylproline and cysteic acid. In this light, the amino acids produced by wool alkali hydrolysis degradation could valorise the wool waste once inserted in industrial chemistry, as a prominent alternative for “greener” adhesives of two components, outlining by these means the feasibility of a practically sustainable circular economy.
