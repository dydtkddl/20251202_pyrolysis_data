You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Intensified depolymerization using ultrasound – A review of mechanisms, reactors, operating conditions and applications Polymeric compounds, which are widely used in many aspects of daily life, have seen a growth in production and usage over the past several years, which has also caused a considerable increase in the environmental concerns based on the required processing of tuning the viscosity or the molecular weight and use of hazardous solvents. Ultrasonic reactors offers promise for significant intensification of the depolymerization quantified as reduction in the intrinsic viscosity, which has been critically highlighted in the current work. The impact of various operating factors such as irradiation time, polymer concentration, various additives, and power on the rate of depolymerisation has been discussed also presenting the analysis of the different reactors applied coupled with suggestions for large scale exploitation. It has been elucidated that the depolymerisation can be maximized based on the optimum selection of the processed volume and power dissipation whereas lower concentration needs to be applied for higher rates. Using different combinations with irradiation approaches or the additives can lead to further intensifying the depolymerisation. Overall, ultrasonic reactors offer promise for inducing selective depolymerisation as required for the specific applications and also significant intensification benefits are expected in the processing.
