Intensified depolymerization using ultrasound – A review of mechanisms, reactors, operating conditions and applications Polymeric compounds, which are widely used in many aspects of daily life, have seen a growth in production and usage over the past several years, which has also caused a considerable increase in the environmental concerns based on the required processing of tuning the viscosity or the molecular weight and use of hazardous solvents. Ultrasonic reactors offers promise for significant intensification of the depolymerization quantified as reduction in the intrinsic viscosity, which has been critically highlighted in the current work. The impact of various operating factors such as irradiation time, polymer concentration, various additives, and power on the rate of depolymerisation has been discussed also presenting the analysis of the different reactors applied coupled with suggestions for large scale exploitation. It has been elucidated that the depolymerisation can be maximized based on the optimum selection of the processed volume and power dissipation whereas lower concentration needs to be applied for higher rates. Using different combinations with irradiation approaches or the additives can lead to further intensifying the depolymerisation. Overall, ultrasonic reactors offer promise for inducing selective depolymerisation as required for the specific applications and also significant intensification benefits are expected in the processing.
