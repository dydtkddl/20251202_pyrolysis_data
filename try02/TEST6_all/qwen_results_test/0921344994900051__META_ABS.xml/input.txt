A model recycling process for low density polyethylene A dissolution/reprecipitation process has been developed for recycling low density polyethylene. In this paper model experiments on virgin material, either in the form of pellets or film for greenhouses, are presented. It is proposed dissolution of the plastic in an appropriate solvent, reprecipitation by means of non-solvents, washing of the material obtained and drying. The solvent mixtures involved are separated by distillation for further reuse. Toluene/acetone proved to be the most satisfactory solvent/non-solvent system. The recycled material was evaluated in terms of the following properties: melt flow index (MFI), crystallinity, mechanical performance in tensile mode and grain size analysis.
