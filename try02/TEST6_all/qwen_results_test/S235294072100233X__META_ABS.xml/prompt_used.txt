You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of synthesis parameters on g-C3N4 polysulfides trapping: A systematic study Beyond Li-ion batteries, one of the most promising technology is the Lithium-Sulphur (Li-S) not only for its higher theoretical energy density (about 2600 Wh kg−1) but because sulfur is relatively inexpensive and non-toxic. However, the Li-S battery suffers from “shuttle effect” of polysulfides. Thus, restricting shuttling means increasing cell performance and durability. DFT calculations showed that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibits strong interactions with Li2S (e.g. superior to graphene-like carbon) and acts as polysulfides trapping agent. In this work, the role of g-C3N4, synthetized from different precursor and at different polycondensation temperatures was systematically studied, using a double layer approach for the electrode preparation, which ensures direct interaction between g-C3N4 and soluble lithium-polysulfides. This systematic study confirms the importance of the morphological and superficial properties of the material. In particular, carbon nitride from urea precursor remarkably improves the performance of the sulphur cathode, increasing the specific capacity of the cell by 25% and improving its useful life over 500 cycles. According to the morphological characterization and the XPS analysis, benefits are achieved from polycondensation of urea at 550°C. The obtained g-C3N4 shows the highest proportion of -NH2 species on the surface, which favours the interaction with polysulfides.
