You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High catalytic activity and stability of X/CoAl2O4 (X = Ni, Co, Rh, Ru) catalysts with no observable coke formation applied in the autothermal dry reforming of methane lined on cordierite monolith reactors The autothermal dry reforming of methane was performed using the novel CoAl2O4 spinel as a catalyst support on the monolithic and fixed bed reactors. X/CoAl2O4 (X = Ni, Co, Rh, Ru) and Ni/γ-Al2O3 nanocrystalline mesoporous catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, FESEM, HRTEM and TGA. The effects of different experimental parameters, such as temperature and gas hourly space velocity on CH4 and CO2 Conversions, H2 yield and H2/Co ratio were examined and studied. The monolithic reactor has a much higher capacity and efficiency than a fixed bed reactor. Methane conversion and catalyst stability at 700 °C were enhanced via the addition of Nobel metals such as Ru and Rh. Maximum methane conversions of 98% was observed for the sample with the CoAl2O4 support and Rh content (3 wt%), with no sign of catalyst deactivation or carbon formation, making these promising materials for the dry reforming reaction.
