Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of ironbark sawdust and plastic waste over strontium loaded hierarchical Y-zeolite The objective of this research is to synthesize hierarchical strontium loaded Y-zeolite and study its application for ironbark (IB) and plastic waste (PW) co-pyrolysis. Commercial parent Y-zeolite (Si/Al = 2.48) was modified via sequential dealumination-desilication using citric acid and NaOH. Further, strontium (8 wt %) was loaded into the modified Y-zeolite via wet and dry impregnation methods. The prepared catalyst was characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isothermal, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) combined with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). After dealumination (treatment using 0.1 M of citric acid), the external surface area and Si/Al ratio increased from 53.5 to 147.4 m2/g and 2.48 to 5.36, respectively. However, the sequential desilication treatment reduced Si/Al ratio from 5.36 to 2.57. In addition, Y-zeolite enhanced the total aromatic percentage and reduced the acidic group in co-pyrolysis oil.
