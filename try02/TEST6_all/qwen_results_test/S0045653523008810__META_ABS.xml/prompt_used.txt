You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Silica enhanced activation and stability of Fe/Mn decorated sludge biochar composite for tetracycline degradation In this study, SiO2-composited biochar decorated with Fe/Mn was prepared by co-pyrolysis method. The degradation performance of the catalyst was evaluated by activating persulfate (PS) to degrade tetracycline (TC). The effects of pH, initial TC concentration, PS concentration, catalyst dosage and coexisting anions on degradation efficiency and kinetics of TC were investigated. Under optimal conditions (TC = 40 mg L−1, pH = 6.2, PS = 3.0 mM, catalyst = 0.1 g L−1), the kinetic reaction rate constant could reach 0.0264 min−1 in Fe2Mn1@BC-0.3SiO2/PS system, which was 12 times higher than that in the BC/PS system (0.00201 min−1). The electrochemical, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that both metal oxides and oxygen-containing functional groups provide more active sites to activate PS. The redox cycle between Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Mn(II)/Mn(III)/Mn(IV) accelerated the electron transfer and sustained the catalytic activation of PS. Radical quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements confirmed that surface sulfate radical (SO4 •−) play a key role in TC degradation. Three possible degradation pathways of TC were proposed based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) analysis, the toxicity of TC and its intermediates was analyzed by bioluminescence inhibition test. In addition to the enhanced catalytic performance, the presence of silica also improved the stability of the catalyst, as confirmed by cyclic experiment and metal ion leaching analysis. The Fe2Mn1@BC-0.3SiO2 catalyst, derived from low-cost metals and bio-waste materials, offer an environmentally friendly option to design and implement heterogenous catalyst system for pollutant removal in water.
