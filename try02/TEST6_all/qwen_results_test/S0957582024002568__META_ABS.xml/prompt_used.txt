You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective adsorption of norfloxacin from water on magnetic biochar composite derived from cellulase hydrolysis apple branch: Synthesis optimization, performance assessment and mechanism insight Based on the optimization of feedstock and temperature condition, we synthesized a novel biochar composite (CHMAB) by pyrolyzing apple branch after cellulase hydrolysis and magnetization as well as coating them with humic acid (HA). Compared with the simultaneously prepared magnetic biochar (MAB) and HA-coated magnetic biochar (HMAB), batch adsorption test results showed that CHMAB had the best norfloxacin (NOR) removal performance in a wide pH range (2−12). The endothermic and spontaneous adsorption behavior of NOR on CHMAB could be better suited to the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model with maximum absorption capacity (81.08 mg g−1) at 35℃. Pore filling, π-π EDA interactions, hydrogen bonding, surface complexation, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions might all be implicated in the NOR removal process. Additionally, the regenerated CHMAB still maintained 99.23% removal efficiency for 0.1 mol L−1 NOR and performed well after seven cycles. These findings highlighted the possibility of enhancing the adsorption capacity of biochar for antibiotics by modification through cellulase hydrolysis of precursor and HA coating procedure. It is noteworthy that the use of low-cost agricultural and forestry wastes to produce adsorbents for emerging contaminants such as antibiotics could have greater potential for future practical applications under the ongoing dual carbon policy.
