Upcycling of waste acrylonitrile butadiene styrene as N-doped carbocatalyst for peroxymonosulfate-induced degradation by solvothermal process Advanced upcycling of post-consumer waste plastics into functional carbocatalyst has emerged rapidly as a strategy for simultaneously achieving waste plastics disposal and alternative catalysts fabrication. In this study, this type of magnetic N-doped carbocatalyst hybrid was fabricated by a facile solvothermal impregnation of metallic nitrates into waste acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer. The key point of the process was that solvothermal impregnation remarkably enhanced a homogeneous metal dispersion and graphitic N structure was stably introduced into carbocatalyst due to N heteroatoms in inherent structure of waste plastics. It was found that carbocatalyst with predominant encapsulation of magnetic CoFe2O4, Fe0.64Ni0.36 and CoFe possessed excellent catalytic performance to activate peroxymonosulfate with substantial degradation of 98.3% synthetic azo contaminant. Mechanism study indicated that graphitic N and metal species exhibited strong synergistic effects for peroxymonosulfate activation to generate SO4·−, ·OH and 1O2. This system achieves a dual-pathway degradation and electron transfer from azo contaminant to peroxymonosulfate to dominate degradation of azo contaminant, providing a new insight into magnetic carbocatalyst confinement from plastic scrap for peroxymonosulfate activation and its versatile application in wastewater reclamation.
