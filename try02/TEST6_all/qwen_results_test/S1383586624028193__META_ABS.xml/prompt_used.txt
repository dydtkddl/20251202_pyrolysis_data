You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling of waste acrylonitrile butadiene styrene as N-doped carbocatalyst for peroxymonosulfate-induced degradation by solvothermal process Advanced upcycling of post-consumer waste plastics into functional carbocatalyst has emerged rapidly as a strategy for simultaneously achieving waste plastics disposal and alternative catalysts fabrication. In this study, this type of magnetic N-doped carbocatalyst hybrid was fabricated by a facile solvothermal impregnation of metallic nitrates into waste acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer. The key point of the process was that solvothermal impregnation remarkably enhanced a homogeneous metal dispersion and graphitic N structure was stably introduced into carbocatalyst due to N heteroatoms in inherent structure of waste plastics. It was found that carbocatalyst with predominant encapsulation of magnetic CoFe2O4, Fe0.64Ni0.36 and CoFe possessed excellent catalytic performance to activate peroxymonosulfate with substantial degradation of 98.3% synthetic azo contaminant. Mechanism study indicated that graphitic N and metal species exhibited strong synergistic effects for peroxymonosulfate activation to generate SO4·−, ·OH and 1O2. This system achieves a dual-pathway degradation and electron transfer from azo contaminant to peroxymonosulfate to dominate degradation of azo contaminant, providing a new insight into magnetic carbocatalyst confinement from plastic scrap for peroxymonosulfate activation and its versatile application in wastewater reclamation.
