You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic enhancement of bio-oil quality through hydrochloric or acetic acid-washing pretreatment and catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass Peanut shells were used as raw materials, and the synergistic effects of various acid pretreatments and catalytic pyrolysis for biomass were comprehensively studied. The results showed that the oil yield of 0.5 mol/L hydrochloric acid treatment was 44.75 wt%, and that of 0.5 mol/L acetic acid treatment was 43.40 wt%. The solid products decreased apparently after pretreatment. Acid-washing pretreatment and the subsequent catalytic pyrolysis of the pretreated biomass promoted the yield of aromatic in bio-oil. The yield of bio-oil gradually decreased while the gas yield increased with the increase of catalytic pyrolysis temperature. Ketones and anhydrosugars were also reduced in the bio-oil, while aromatics increased significantly, reaching the highest value of 19.62 wt% (0.5 mol/L hydrochloric acid treatment) and 19.30 wt% (0.5 mol/L acetic acid treatment) respectively at 600 ℃. Synergy effect facilitated the conversion of pyrolytic intermediates to gas and aromatics. Besides, the possible formation mechanism of bio-oil under different pyrolysis conditions is proposed. The study indicates the optimized combination could effectively improve the quality of bio-oil.
