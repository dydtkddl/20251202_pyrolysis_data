You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oscillatory flow bioreactor operating at high solids loading for enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass Bioreactor technology applied to enzymatic hydrolysis has been studied to overcome the main limitation of enzymatic hydrolysis. This work presents the application of an oscillatory flow reactor (OFR) for enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass at high solids loading [> 15% (w/v)]. OFR consists of a tubular reactor with periodical constrictions where vortices are created due to the oscillating flow determined by frequency and amplitude. This can be favorable for enzymatic hydrolysis as efficient mixtures can be accomplished at low shear rates. OFR batch operation was tested at 18% (w/v) to evaluate the amplitude (2 – 6 mm) and frequency (2 – 4 Hz) conditions that best fit the process using hydrothermally pretreated corncob and low enzyme dose. The conditions tested demonstrated a positive effect on the process, where at an amplitude of 6 mm and frequency of 4 Hz, an increment of 24–34% in productivity was observed. Then, three different fed-batch strategies were tested achieving 25% (w/v) solid loading where up to 170.0 g/L of glucose was obtained representing 97% saccharification yield. This novel contribution using OFR at high solids loading is crucial as advances in lignocellulosic biotransformation technology are still in demand to achieve efficient and economically feasible processes.
