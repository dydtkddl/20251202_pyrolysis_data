Gasification of municipal solid waste: Progress, challenges, and prospects Sustainable waste management is the core issue of modern societies because of its increasing social and environmental concerns. Therefore, the scientific community is continuously struggling to develop scientific waste management proposals in order to mitigate the associated health hazards and environmental anxieties. Thermal treatments are viable solutions for waste management, especially for municipal wastes. Among these, gasification is a preferred technique to envisage the concept of a circular bio-economy by producing biohydrogen rich syngas. In this manuscript, we have critically reviewed various gasification technologies incorporating different feed alternatives, catalysts used, and technology adoption. Individual gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) has many technical concerns; therefore, feedstock management by mixing with agricultural wastes can be a workable solution that can be opted with various existing gasifiers’ designs. However, an economic balance has a stern influence on design strategy. In addition, regional waste disposal regulations and implementation are vital to curbing the MSW management issues practically.
