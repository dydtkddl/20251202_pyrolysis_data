You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling the role of hydrogels in managing water contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: A critical review with emphasis on agricultural applications The contamination of water by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) poses significant threats to environmental and human health. These chemicals contaminate drinking water and irrigation systems, including surface and groundwater supplies. Despite ongoing efforts to regulate and restrict PFAS, these substances remain widely used, with new variants still being developed. Various treatment processes have been explored to address this issue, with hydrogel-based adsorption emerging as a promising approach. This review evaluates the role of hydrogels and their composites in remediating PFAS-contaminated water. Advanced treatment methods, including oxidation, coagulation, and adsorption with conventional adsorbents, are compared to hydrogel-based adsorbents. Hydrogels offer advantages such as enhanced recovery, reusability, and the ability to concentrate PFAS for subsequent degradation via oxidative methods. Furthermore, their tunable hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties enable efficient removal of both long- and short-chain PFAS. The highest PFAS removal efficiencies, exceeding 90 %, and adsorption capacities of up to 1276 mg/g have been reported for hydrogels containing cationic or quaternary ammonium groups. Theoretical studies suggest that hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role in the removal of long-chain PFAS, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). In contrast, effective removal of short-chain PFAS, such as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), relies on both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. By highlighting the benefits and limitations of hydrogels, this review underscores their potential as versatile tools for addressing the global challenge of PFAS contamination. Additionally, it rationalizes the challenges and future perspectives in this field, offering valuable insights to guide students and researchers in shaping the direction of future studies.
