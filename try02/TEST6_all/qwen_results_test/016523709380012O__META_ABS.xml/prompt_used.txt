You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic study of the flash pyrolysis of almond shells in a fluidized bed reactor at high temperatures Two correlation models have been developed and applied to simulate the primary and secondary reactions (assuming first order kinetics for both reactions) as well as the heat transfer in the pyrolysis of almond shells in a system with a fluidized bed reactor. The biomass is discharged onto the hot sand fluidized bed. The primary decomposition takes place during the fast heating of the particle inside the sand fluidized bed. The cracking of the volatiles evolved takes place in the upper part of the reactor, from the top of the sand bed to the heat of the reactor. The first model calculates the kinetic constants of the primary and secondary reactions in the pyrolysis. The apparent activation energy for the primary reaction is very low, showing the effect of the heat transfer. The primary kinetic constant obtained should be considered as a correlation constant, including both the chemical reaction and the heat transfer. A second model was developed with different assumptions concerning distinct kinetic expressions for the primary reactions obtained from the Pyroprobe 100 and TGA, considering heat transfer to the particle. The heat transfer from the fluidized bed to the almond shell particles as well as that from the wall of the reactor to the volatiles has also been considered. The model reproduces the experimental data very well and the constants obtained compare favorably with published data, both for kinetic constants and for heat transfer numbers.
