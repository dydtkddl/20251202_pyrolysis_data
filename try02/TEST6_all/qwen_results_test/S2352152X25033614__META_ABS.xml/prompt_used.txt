You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Predicting the electrochemical performance of biomass derived carbon hosts in lithium–sulfur batteries using machine learning Porous carbon materials are generally employed as sulfur hosts in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries to address the poor conductivity of sulfur, volume changes during charge/discharge, and polysulfide shuttling. In this context, biomass-derived carbon materials have garnered significant attention owing to their eco-friendliness, tunable porosity, and cost-effectiveness. However, the selection of biomass is often arbitrary, with its application and performance largely relying on a trial-and-error approach. To overcome this limitation, this study leverages machine learning (ML) to predict the electrochemical performance of carbon materials derived from diverse biomass sources as hosts in Li–S batteries. By utilizing experimental data from published literature and feature engineering, the ML models identify the key factors influencing battery performance and enable systematic identification of promising biomass precursors. In essence, biomass composition, carbon synthesis conditions, and current density are selected as critical features. Pearson correlation coefficients guide feature selection, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis determines the relative importance of features for different models. Among different models, Histogram gradient boosting machine (HistGBM) exhibits superior predictive performance, maintaining consistently high accuracy across all datasets, achieving reliable predictions with a prediction error as low as 9.67 % (47.94 mAh/g). Besides usual training and testing, the developed model is also validated using an in-house data set obtained from activated jackfruit peel-derived carbon as a sulfur host, reinforcing its predictive accuracy and reliability with a prediction error of 6.45% (21.48 mAh/g). Overall, the ML-based approach can reduce experimental efforts, enhance material optimization, and accelerate the development of high-performance sulfur host materials.
