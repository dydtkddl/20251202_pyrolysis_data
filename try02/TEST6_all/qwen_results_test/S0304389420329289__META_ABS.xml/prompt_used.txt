You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PAEs and PBDEs in plastic fragments and wetland sediments in Yangtze estuary Phthalates (PAEs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as additives in various plastic products. Because of their ubiquity and potential hazards to the environment, they have attracted widespread attention. This research supports the addition critical data of the concentration and distribution of PAEs and PBDEs in the plastic fragments and wetland sediments in Yangtze Estuary. The concentrations of Σ7PAEs and Σ9PBDEs in the plastic samples in Yangtze Estuary wetlands were 26.8–4241.8 μg/g and n.d. (no detectable) to 250.1 μg/g, respectively. The sixteen PAEs and eight PBDEs varied from 35.9 to 36225.2 ng/g and 3.9–253.0 ng/g in sediment samples. The dominant types of these chemicals in plastic and sediment samples were diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dioctyl phthalate (DEHP) and BDE-209. According to correlation analysis and principal component analysis, the major sources of additives in sediment were associated with the leak from plastic fragment and microplastic. Based on the equilibrium partitioning theory and Sediment Quality Guidelines (SeQGs), the ecological risk of PAEs (high risk) and PBDEs (moderate risk) were evaluated. Overall, the investigated area has been moderately polluted by additives and microplastics; therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the control of environmental input of plastic waste.
