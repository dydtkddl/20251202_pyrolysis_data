PAEs and PBDEs in plastic fragments and wetland sediments in Yangtze estuary Phthalates (PAEs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used as additives in various plastic products. Because of their ubiquity and potential hazards to the environment, they have attracted widespread attention. This research supports the addition critical data of the concentration and distribution of PAEs and PBDEs in the plastic fragments and wetland sediments in Yangtze Estuary. The concentrations of Σ7PAEs and Σ9PBDEs in the plastic samples in Yangtze Estuary wetlands were 26.8–4241.8 μg/g and n.d. (no detectable) to 250.1 μg/g, respectively. The sixteen PAEs and eight PBDEs varied from 35.9 to 36225.2 ng/g and 3.9–253.0 ng/g in sediment samples. The dominant types of these chemicals in plastic and sediment samples were diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dioctyl phthalate (DEHP) and BDE-209. According to correlation analysis and principal component analysis, the major sources of additives in sediment were associated with the leak from plastic fragment and microplastic. Based on the equilibrium partitioning theory and Sediment Quality Guidelines (SeQGs), the ecological risk of PAEs (high risk) and PBDEs (moderate risk) were evaluated. Overall, the investigated area has been moderately polluted by additives and microplastics; therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the control of environmental input of plastic waste.
