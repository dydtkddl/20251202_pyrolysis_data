You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignin depolymerization and biotransformation to industrially important chemicals/biofuels Lignin is a potential feedstock due to its energy content and its abundant availability from biomass based biorefinery. Among the different fractions of biomass, lignin has been under utilized due to its hetero aromatic polymeric structure. Development of options for lignin or lignin rich residue valorization can balance the economics of bioethanol based biorefineries. Lignin is also being viewed as alternative to the aromatics and polymer industry, apart from the source of biofuels/bioenergy. In spite of various physico-chemical and other available abiotic methods, biological methods of lignin depolymerization and its transformation to biofuels or value-added products got significance due to their economic and environmentally benign nature. Extensive research has been carried out on the biological methods of lignin depolymerization, considering fungi, enzymes and bacteria. In this review, a comprehensive view on types of lignin and their characteristics, existing methods of lignin depolymerization with a special emphasis on microbial methods and various industrial applications, viz., biofuels, lipids, polyhydroxyalkanoates, vanillin and dicarboxylic acid, etc., were presented. In conclusion, the critical aspects of lignin depolymerization to be considered to increase the product yield and possible future perspectives were also discussed.
