You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing hydrothermal extraction of plant cell wall polysaccharides using radio frequency energy: A case study on extracting pectin from pomelo peels Radio frequency (RF) heating and hydrothermal treatment, as environmentally friendly and efficient technologies, have been widely applied in food processing. This study aims to investigate the effect of RF-assisted hydrothermal extraction (RFAHE) of plant cell wall polysaccharides, using pomelo peel pectin (PPP) as a case study. Based on the optimized RFAHE operating conditions, the yield, physicochemical, and structural properties of PPP obtained from RFAHE, acidic RFAHE (ARFAHE), microwave-assisted HE (MWAHE), and hydrothermal extraction (HE) alone were compared. The optimized RFAHE conditions are as follows: heated at 122 °C and liquid/solid ratio of 40 mL/g for 17 min. The pectin yields were 20.8 ± 0.7, 20.6 ± 0.8, 23.8 ± 0.6, and 18.7 ± 0.6 % for RFAHE, MWAHE, ARFAHE, and HE alone, respectively. Among the four samples, the RFAHE sample had the highest degree of esterification and antioxidant capacity, as well as the lowest molecular weight, while the ARFAHE sample exhibited the opposite characteristics. The GalA content of the RFAHE sample was higher than that of the MWAHE sample but slightly lower than the standard for commercial food-grade pectin. FTIR, XRD, and 1H NMR analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in the main chemical structures among the four samples. The results from this study confirm that the extraction efficacy of RFAHE is superior to that of MWAHE, and offer fundamental insights into the application of RFAHE for recovering cell wall polysaccharides from plant food wastes and byproducts.
