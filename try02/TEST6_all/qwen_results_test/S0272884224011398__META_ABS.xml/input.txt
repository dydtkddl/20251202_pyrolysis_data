Advanced ceramics and coatings for wear and corrosion related applications in modern high-efficient coal production and processing: A technical review The wear and corrosion issues commonly occurring in coal production and processing and applications of advanced ceramics and coatings to combat these issues are reviewed. The ceramics' and coatings' application areas encompass (i) solid (bulk) ceramic and composite components, specifically cyclones, lining and piping systems working in prolonged contacts with coal solid particles and concentrated coal-containing slurries, which move at high velocities and various trajectories through these systems, (ii) lining and accessories in coal-based materials’ combustion and related heat treatment equipment, and (iii) piping systems, which should work in contact with high-temperature corrosive gas flows, often containing abrasive particulates, occurring through combustion processes. The comprehensive review demonstrates manufacturing of large components made of oxide and non-oxide ceramics (specifically SiC-based), ceramic-based composites and protective coatings on steel components, especially for long piping. Some of these materials and products, specifically, alumina-based ceramics and SiC-based ceramics and thermal diffusion and reaction-processed coatings, were developed and manufactured by the author and his team. Structure and properties of these materials, as well as their manufacturing features, affecting wear and corrosion resistance of components are discussed. The highly consolidated materials based on considered ceramic ingredients with microcrystalline structures or/and with larger reinforcing grains of selected sizes provide high wear and corrosion resistance, including for high temperature applications. The recorded data and proposed analysis may be also applicable for some other mineral and power generation processes and situations.
