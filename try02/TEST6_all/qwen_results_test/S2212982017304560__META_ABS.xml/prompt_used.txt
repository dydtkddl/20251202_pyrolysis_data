You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CaO-based CO2 sorbents: A review on screening, enhancement, cyclic stability, regeneration and kinetics modelling This article reviews current developments in metal-based sorbents for carbon capture with emphasis on calcium oxide. A broad overview of carbon dioxide capture with metals in various forms including oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and zirconates is presented. Based on the findings from comparative assessments of these sorbents, CaO appears to be the best solid sorbent for CO2 capture at high temperatures, and its numerous advantages are discussed in this work. For this reason, a detailed review has been conducted for calcium oxide, which works as a sorbent at temperatures up to 700°C through carbonation, and desorbs CO2 above 700°C by calcination of CaCO3 at atmospheric pressure. A review of studies on kinetics modelling of CO2 capture with CaO-based sorbents is also included in this work. Decay in activity caused by sintering and attrition is identified as the greatest challenge with CaO-based sorbents. This work also focuses on the available techniques for enhancing performance and cyclic stability. Reactivation of the sorbents by hydration and reduction in decay rate by doping with inert supports and synthetic sorbents are reviewed. Additionally, the use of biomass resources (waste animal shells) as competitive sources of CaCO3 is discussed in this work. The review concludes with recommendations for future studies in carbon capture and sequestration.
