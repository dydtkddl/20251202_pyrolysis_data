You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of the Imbert downdraft gasifier using a species-transport CFD model including tar-cracking reactions Primary tar reduction is an effective method to diminish tar concentration in producer gas obtained from a downdraft biomass gasification process. It tends to be more economical than secondary tar reduction in post-gas-cleaning processes. This study used a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to analyze the performance of an Imbert downdraft biomass gasifier. The spatial distribution of producer gas compositions in the gasifier was explored. The CFD model was validated, using the same conditions and design, by published experimental data. The effects of the key design parameter, i.e., throat diameter, represented by the ratio of throat to gasifier diameters and the height of air nozzle from the throat, on the gasifier performance were predicted. The tar concentration and cold gas efficiency (CGE) were computed. Although the modeling results indicated that decreasing the throat diameter can decrease the tar content up to 0.005 g Nm−3, the CGE decreased by approximately 7% compared with the scenario with no throat. Decreasing the nozzle-to-throat lengths abated tar and hydrogen composition, but the CGE exhibited fluctuation. Therefore, a compromise between tar reduction and the CGE is required to improve the design of the Imbert downdraft gasifier.
