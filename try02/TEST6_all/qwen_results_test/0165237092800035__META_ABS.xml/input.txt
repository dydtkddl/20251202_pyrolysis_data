Thermoanalytic studies of the pyrolysis of CpTiCl2N(SiMe3)2 and its use as a precursor for the chemical vapor deposition of titanium carbonitride The synthesis and characterization of a triclinic allotropic form of CpTiCl2N(SiMe3)2 is reported. Thermal analysis and simultaneous mass spectroscopy studies carried out under nitrogen and hydrogen show that this complex decomposes to titanium carbonitride at about 350–370°C. The weight loss observed under hydrogen flow is higher than that observed under nitrogen flow. Elemental analyses show that the residue from nitrogen pyrolysis is more carbon rich than the residue from hydrogen pyrolysis, indicating that carbon is more readily removed during pyrolysis in hydrogen. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments using CpTiCl2N(SiMe3)2 as an organometallic precursor have been carried out on glass, silicon and steel, using a hot wall type CVD reactor. Shiny, bronze—black, metallic thin films have been obtained and characterized as titanium carbonitride by EDS and XPS analyses.
