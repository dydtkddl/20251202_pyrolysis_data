Microstructure and fracture toughness characterization of three 9Cr ODS EUROFER steels with different thermo-mechanical treatments Ferritic martensitic ODS steels are one of the candidate structural materials for future Gen-IV nuclear fission and fusion reactors. The dependence of fracture toughness on microstructure was investigated by comparing three 9Cr ODS EUROFER steels manufactured through different thermo-mechanical processing routes. Quasi-static fracture toughness testing was performed with sub-sized C(T) specimens and microstructural characterization was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that at lower test temperatures (−100 – 22 °C), the fracture toughness was primarily controlled by crack initiation at sub-micron particles and by production of secondary cracks during fracture. At higher temperatures (above 100 °C), fracture toughness was predominantly controlled by the matrix ductility and the grain boundary strength with a relatively ductile coarse-grained alloy demonstrating higher fracture toughness compared to high-strength fine-grained alloys. These results and discussion show that variations in thermomechanical treatments can produce significant differences in microstructure and fracture toughness behavior of ferritic martensitic ODS steels.
