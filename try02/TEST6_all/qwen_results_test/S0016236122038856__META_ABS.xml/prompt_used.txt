You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-circularity of spent coffee grounds and polyethylene via co-pyrolysis: Characteristics, kinetics, and products Spent coffee grounds (CG) and polyethylene (PE) are the two typical types of major solid wastes. Their co-pyrolysis may be leveraged to reduce their waste streams and pollution and valorize energy and by-products. In this study, their co-pyrolysis performances, interaction effects, kinetics, and products were characterized in response to the varying temperature and blend ratio. The co-pyrolysis exhibited the two main stages of (1) the degradation of CG (180–380 °C) and (2) the depolymerization of PE and the decomposition of lignin (380–550 °C). The pyrolysis performance rose from 1.34×10−4%3·min−2·°C−3 with the mono-pyrolysis of CG to 26.32×10−4%3·min−2·°C−3 with the co-pyrolysis of 10 % CG and 90 % PE. The co-pyrolysis of 70 % CG and 30 % PE (CP73) achieved a lower activation energy than did the mono-pyrolysis of the two fuels. The products of the CG pyrolysis included a large number of alcohols, ethers, ketones, esters, and other oxygen-containing compounds, with a proportion as high as 65.01 %. The products of CP73 at 550 °C resulted in the yields of hydrocarbons and alcohols up to 93.61 %, beneficial to the further utilization of the co-pyrolytic products. Not only did the co-pyrolysis valorize its products, but also it enhanced their co-circularity. Artificial neural network-based joint optimization showed CP73 in the range of 517–1000 °C as the best combination of the conditions. The study provides new insights into the co-pyrolytic disposal of spent coffee grounds and polyethylene so as to improve the waste stream reduction and the valorization of energy and products.
