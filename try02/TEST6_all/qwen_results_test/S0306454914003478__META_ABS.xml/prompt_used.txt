You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Iodine–paint interactions during nuclear reactor severe accidents To assess the radiological consequences of a severe reactor accident, it is important to be able to predict the behaviour of iodine in containment. Some interactions between iodine and containment paint (e.g., adsorption) have been well known for a long time. However, in recent years, new phenomena have been identified that can affect the gas phase iodine concentration in the longer term (e.g., the release of molecular iodine and organic iodides from irradiated painted surfaces). Several international collaborations and organizations around the world are currently addressing different aspects of this topic, including laboratory experiments and theoretical studies (ab initio) designed to improve the mechanistic understanding of the phenomena. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms will provide explanations for behavioural differences observed between paint types, and will support the extrapolation of laboratory results to the safety analyses of nuclear reactors. The purpose of this paper is to present a selection of recent work performed by Severe Accident Research Network (SARNET) members regarding iodine–paint interactions and paint aging in order to improve the common understanding and better define what has still to be done in this area. The Severe Accident Research Network (SARNET) provides a framework within which members can share and discuss results.
