You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE for enhanced hydrocarbon yield: A boosted regression tree assisted kinetics study for effective recycling of waste plastic Kinetic study is crucial in digital chemical engineering as a foundation for understanding and optimizing chemical processes. By analyzing reaction rates and mechanisms, kinetic models provide essential data for designing reactors, scaling processes, and predicting performance under various conditions. This study is part of a broader research series focused on efficiently converting waste plastics into hydrocarbons through catalytic pyrolysis. As the first study from the series, it investigates the thermal degradation of pristine high-density polyethylene (HDPE), aiming to understand its reaction kinetics under catalytic and non-catalytic conditions. The research employs iso-conventional methods to estimate the activation of energy HDPE and leverages a machine learning algorithm, specifically the BRT model, to effectively predict activation energy and optimize pyrolysis parameters. The activation energy (323 kJ/mol) of non-catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE was reduced to 164 kJ/mol during catalytic pyrolysis. Thermodynamic parameters such as change in activation enthalpy ( Δ H ‡ ), activation Gibbs free energy ( Δ G ‡ ) and, activation entropy ( Δ S ‡ ) were also significantly reduced during catalytic reaction. The statistical and machine-learning approaches were used in the kinetic analyses. Boosted regression trees (BRT) were used to predict the E a during conversion at different heating rates for non-catalytic and catalytic processes. The liquid and gas fractions obtained from HDPE at different temperatures were characterized. The increase in yield of hydrocarbons at elevated temperatures indicated the reuse potential of plastic waste. The comprehensive analysis of HDPE exhibited 86 % of carbon and 14 % of hydrogen contributing to high heating value (HHV) of 44.41 MJ/kg.
