You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of end-of-life solar panels: Focusing on the pyrolysis conversion of back sheet from a micro perspective The accelerated deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems will inevitably result in an increasing volume of end-of-life PV panels, which will pose significant environmental challenges and could potentially hinder the growth of renewable energy systems. This study provided a comprehensive examination of the pyrolysis behavior, kinetics, thermodynamics, and evolved products of typical back sheet PVDF/PET/fluorine film (KPF). In addition, an analysis of the enthalpy-entropy compensation (EEC) was performed. Reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations were employed to identify atomic-level intermediates and investigate the reaction pathway. The decomposition of KPF sample occurred in three stages, characterized by temperature ranges of below 473.15 K, 473.15–923.15 K, and 923.15–1173.15 K. The corresponding mass losses were found to be 0.61–0.90, 78.30–82.06, and 1.38–2.56 wt%, respectively. The predominant products identified included benzoic acid and its derivatives, which corroborated the strong presence of the C=O group in the FTIR analysis. ReaxFF-MD simulations revealed the formation of C7H4O2, C7H4O and C7H5O2 species, and the decomposition process was found to involve random scission, decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions. Activation energies from the FWO, KAS, and Friedman methods exhibited a declining trend, decreasing from 72.12 to 40.92 kJ mol−1. The master-plot analysis indicated that the P2 mechanism provided a more accurate description of KPF pyrolysis. The positive ΔH and ΔG values confirmed that KPF decomposition was an endothermic and non-spontaneous process. The ΔH-ΔS relationship indicated the presence of an EEC, with a compensation temperature of 687.49 K and an experimental temperature of 766.60 K.
