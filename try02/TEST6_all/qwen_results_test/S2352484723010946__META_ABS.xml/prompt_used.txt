You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis oil from post-consumer packaging and its ageing: Physical and chemical properties and drop-in performance in a power generating unit Waste plastics/pyrolysis oil (WPO) obtained from a batch rotary kiln pyrolysis reactor was collected and stored for 60 months in dark at 10 °C, periodically thoroughly characterized for changes in physical and chemical properties and finally tested as the drop-in fuel for power generating units. Changes during storage were manifested through chain length increase from C5-C33 to C5-C43 and distillation curve shift for 150 °C. The changes were attributed to repolymerization reactions and consequently lowered alkene to alkane ratio, occurring at a slow rate during storage. The drop-in performance of aged WPO was evaluated under a wide range of operating parameters in a compression ignition engine based power generating unit. The results were compared with those obtained with conventional diesel fuel at the same injection and gas path parameters. Emission wise, the trends obtained for aged WPO and diesel were differing in the range of 20%, while more than 50% lower CO emissions could be obtained with WPO in optimized operating points, albeit the order of magnitude higher viscosity of aged WPO. With tailored control strategies and careful guidance of in-cylinder thermodynamic conditions it is possible to exploit the increased alkane content of aged WPO. Results provide a comprehensive basis for further development of control strategies, oriented towards stationary power generation applications with high intermittency, where long and mid-term storage of WPO is expected.
