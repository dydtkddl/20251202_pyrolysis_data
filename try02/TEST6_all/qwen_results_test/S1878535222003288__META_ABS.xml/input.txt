Optimization of biodiesel production via transesterification of soybean oil using α-MoO3 catalyst obtained by the combustion method A catalyst based on MoO3 was synthesized by a simple and fast pilot-scale combustion reaction method and applied to the conversion of soybean oil to biodiesel via transesterification. For that, the statistical analysis of the catalyst amount and temperature, factors that influence the process, was evaluated by means of central composite design 22. MoO3 was characterized in terms of structure by X-ray diffraction (XRD), textural characterization Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), density by helium pycnometry (DE), particle size analysis (DG) and acidity tests by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), chemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence (EDX), morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and catalytic properties. The transesterification products were characterized by gas chromatography (GC), acidity index (AI) and kinematic viscosity (KV). The results indicate the catalyst formation with a surface area of 1.36 m2g−1, and density of 4.5 g/cm3 which consists of a single crystalline phase of orthorhombic configuration, with total NH3 acidity of 33.61 μ.mol/g. Morphological characterization revealed that the catalyst is formed by irregular plates of various sizes and shapes, with a wide sizes range of agglomerated particles. In the soybean oil transesterification reactions, the catalyst was active showing 96.9% conversion to ethyl esters. The experimental design was meaningful and predictive, with a reliability level of 95%. The statistical analysis identified temperature as a significant variable for the adopted planning. To conclude, a new single-phase catalyst (α-MoO3) has been developed and successfully applied to the biodiesel Synthesis from soybean oil. These results have a positive and promising impact for biodiesel production by transesterification of soybean oil against ethanol.
