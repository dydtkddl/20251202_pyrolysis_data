You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters guiding the localization of regioselectively modified kaolin platelets into a PS/PA6 co-continuous blend This article highlights the role of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters on the localization of modified kaolin platelets into a high interfacial tension co-continuous PS/PA6 blend after extrusion, injection molding and annealing. Three kinds of copolymers were synthesized and grafted on kaolin: poly(styrene-co-(methacryloyloxy)methyl phosphonic acid) copolymer (P(S-co-MAPC1(OH)2)), polystyrene terminated 3-(mercaptopropyl)triethoxysilane, (ETS-PS) and poly(styrene-co-3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) copolymer, (P(S-co-MPS)). Those copolymers were distinguished by (1) the nature of their functional groups (phosphonic acid that reacts only with aluminol groups or alkoxysilane that reacts with both silanol and aluminol groups), (2) the amount of functional groups and (3) their molecular weights. After functionalization the kaolin samples (K1, K2 and K3, respectively) were analyzed by FTIR, TGA and Py-GC/MS to evaluate the grafting. It was shown that P(S-co-MAPC1(OH)2) and P(S-co-MPS) copolymers grafted on kaolin led to highly anisotropic K1 and K3 kaolin platelets, respectively. Then, 50/50/5 PS/PA6/Ki samples (i = 0 to 3) were processed as follows: (1) kaolin platelets were dispersed (via solvent cast) into the PS phase. Then, (2) PS + kaolin were melt mixed by microcompounder with PA6, then (3) the PS/PA6/Ki were injection molded into disks and finally (4) they were annealed (via dynamic or quiescent annealing). Thanks to the high shear rate and longtime of mixing during extrusion (microcompounder), all the kaolin platelets (unmodified K, K1, K2 and K3) crossed the interface and were localized in the PA6 phase. All Ki kaolin stayed in the PA6 phase during injection. However, after annealing (quiescent or dynamic), the localization of the nanoplatelets was guided by thermodynamic parameters, and SEM analysis revealed the segregation of K1 and K3 kaolin platelets at the polymers interface, with a high tendency to impede polymer phases coalescence. Hence, modified K1 and K3 kaolin are promising compatibilizing agents for a co-continuous PS/PA6 blend.
