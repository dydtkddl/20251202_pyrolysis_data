You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis products from various types of plastics using TG-FTIR at different reaction temperatures Pyrolysis products of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and municipal plastic waste at different reaction temperatures were predicted in the current study using a newly developed thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) method. The experiments revealed that pyrolysis products of LDPE and PP at 500 °C were almost wax. Above 600 °C, wax formed from LDPE and PP almost disappeared, while the production of light hydrocarbons was enhanced. In the cases of LDPE and PP, the benzene and toluene formations were clearly observed above 800 and 700 °C, respectively. For PS, styrene was observed as the major component at 500–800 °C. With increasing temperature, the formations of alkenes, benzene, and toluene were enhanced at the expense of styrene. Different from other plastics, PET produced a pyrolysis vapor containing mainly CO2 and CO. FT-IR spectra of PET were almost unchanged despite increasing temperature above 600 °C. In the case of municipal plastic waste, the product distribution was similar to those of LDPE and PP. The new TG-FTIR method turned out to be an effective tool to predict pyrolysis products, especially gases products having low molecular weights.
