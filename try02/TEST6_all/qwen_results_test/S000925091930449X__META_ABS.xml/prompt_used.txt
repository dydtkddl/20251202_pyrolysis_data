You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conceptual design of production of eco-friendly polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers catalyzed by acid functionalized ionic liquids As the clean fuel additives, polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (DMM n ) could significantly reduce carbonaceous particulate matters and volatile organic pollutants in the exhaust gas. Large scale production in a green route would be crucial if the DMM n tailored diesel was applied to the abatement of widespread PM air pollution. In the production, heavy components usually should be separated, recycled, decomposed and re-reacted to gain the aimed products, which would significantly increase complexity and energy consumption of the process. And fatally, it also might cause blockage of units and pipelines. In this work, to prevent blockage, the facile and robust process producing DMM n was conceptually designed basing on physicochemical properties researches. The process exempting from recycle of heavy components and de-heavy column was proposed according to cold-flow properties. Both energy consumption and fixed capital investment can be saved. The reaction kinetic model, which was described in the form of power law functions, showed good consistency for both propagation and depolymerization reactions. Flash points of diesel blends were also measured for determining specification of light components. This work shows it is feasible that DMM n can be produced from dimethoxy methane and trioxane in the presence of acid functionalized ionic liquids in large scale.
