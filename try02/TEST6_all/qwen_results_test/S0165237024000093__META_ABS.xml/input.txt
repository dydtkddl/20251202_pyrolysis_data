Valorization of bio-oil distillation residue through co-pyrolysis with moso bamboo to prepare biochar: Optimization study on effects of blend ratio, pyrolysis temperature, and residence time In view of the high energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the cement production industry, biomass as the renewable carbon-neutrality energy is promisingly conducive to remitting cement carbon dioxide emissions and simultaneously realizing waste-to-energy initiatives. In this study, bio-oil distillation residue (DR), with high carbon content and heat value, is co-pyrolyzed with moso bamboo (MB) to optimize the bulk and combustion properties of biochar, aiming at yielding bio-fuel as an alternative fuel to replace coals for energy and heat supply in cement industry. The impacts of three primary process parameters on the carbonization reaction were investigated, while the parametric interactions were further estimated by using response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the ultimate, proximate and fuel characteristics of biochars. The results showed the co-pyrolysis synergies between bio-oil distillation residue and moso bamboo endowed the maximum biochar yield of 44.62% and the maximum difference biochar yield of 7.56%. Meanwhile, the experimental carbon content, fixed carbon content and high heat value (HHV) were regulated through coupling parametric distribution and further increased by 1.96%, 2.59% and 1.23 MJ/kg, respectively. The parametric responses on combustion characteristics of biochar based on thermogravimetric analysis were predicted, and the optimal carbonization conditions for biochar production were also summarized. This study would offer an optimal biochar production scheme to adaptively yield coal-like biochar for reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in cement industry.
