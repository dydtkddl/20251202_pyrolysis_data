You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of bio-oil distillation residue through co-pyrolysis with moso bamboo to prepare biochar: Optimization study on effects of blend ratio, pyrolysis temperature, and residence time In view of the high energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the cement production industry, biomass as the renewable carbon-neutrality energy is promisingly conducive to remitting cement carbon dioxide emissions and simultaneously realizing waste-to-energy initiatives. In this study, bio-oil distillation residue (DR), with high carbon content and heat value, is co-pyrolyzed with moso bamboo (MB) to optimize the bulk and combustion properties of biochar, aiming at yielding bio-fuel as an alternative fuel to replace coals for energy and heat supply in cement industry. The impacts of three primary process parameters on the carbonization reaction were investigated, while the parametric interactions were further estimated by using response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the ultimate, proximate and fuel characteristics of biochars. The results showed the co-pyrolysis synergies between bio-oil distillation residue and moso bamboo endowed the maximum biochar yield of 44.62% and the maximum difference biochar yield of 7.56%. Meanwhile, the experimental carbon content, fixed carbon content and high heat value (HHV) were regulated through coupling parametric distribution and further increased by 1.96%, 2.59% and 1.23 MJ/kg, respectively. The parametric responses on combustion characteristics of biochar based on thermogravimetric analysis were predicted, and the optimal carbonization conditions for biochar production were also summarized. This study would offer an optimal biochar production scheme to adaptively yield coal-like biochar for reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in cement industry.
