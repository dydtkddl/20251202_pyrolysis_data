You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantification of trace element emissions from low-carbon emission energy sources: (I) Ca-looping cycle for post-combustion CO2 capture and (II) fixed bed, air blown down-draft gasifier The integrated technologies of gasification and the calcium looping cycle represent the opportunity to produce H2 as an energy carrier while ensuring inherent CO2 capture, thus producing a near-zero or negative emission fuel. Gasification of waste-derived fuel including demolition wood and low density plastic is gaining in interest due to the potential to minimise waste to landfill, whilst also representing a carbon-neutral energy source. However, potential trace element emissions from the gasification of such fuels require investigation to ensure compliance with targets under the EU Ambient Air Quality Directive 2008 and the UK Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010. Likewise, contaminants present in limestone have the potential to be released to the environment under the operating regimes required for carbonation and calcination in the calcium looping cycle for CO2 capture. Solid samples (offline), liquids (offline) and gaseous (offline/online and in-situ mobile ICP-OES) products from a pilot scale fixed bed, air-blown down-draft gasifier and from a pilot scale CO2 capture reactor comprising of the calcium looping cycle, have been collected and analysed in order to gain further understanding of the likely trace element partitioning in both processes. Results showed that a number of trace element contaminants present in the original CO2 sorbent and gasifier fuel samples were also present in the flue gas from both the CO2 capture and gasification processes, implying that integration of the technologies may result in enhanced contamination in the final gaseous product. The main outputs of this study assist in analysing plant requirements, for example gas cleaning, and identifying the environmental emissions and residual disposal.
