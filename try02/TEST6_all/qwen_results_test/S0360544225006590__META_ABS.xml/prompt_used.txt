You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the thermal stability of a new siloxane working fluid modified by octamethyltrisiloxane and its application potential in organic Rankine cycle Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM) is widely utilized as the working fluid in medium-high temperature organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems. Despite the presence of strong Si-O and Si-C bonds in MDM, its thermal stability often falls short in various practical applications and thermal stability tests. Enhancing this thermal stability is essential for expanding its use in medium-high temperature thermal applications. This work evaluates the creation of new compounds through intermediate methyl substitutions with -C2H5, -C6H5, -OSi(CH3)3, -F, and -Cl groups. The findings indicate that trimethylsiloxyalkyl substitutions significantly mitigates Si-Si bond polarization, resulting in an increase in the apparent activation energy for decomposition by approximately 47.9 kJ mol⁻1. Substitutions with -F and -Cl not only elevate bond dissociation free energy but also help suppress Si-Si bond polarization, potentially leading to substantial improvements in thermal stability. Thermal stability tests of MDM_OSi(CH3)3, formed through trimethylsiloxyl substitution, demonstrated its stability at 350 °C, almost 100 °C higher than MDM. In terms of safety, branched siloxanes are more suitable as working fluids in medium-high temperature ORCs compared to straight-chain siloxanes. Moreover, the thermodynamic performance evaluation of MDM_OSi(CH3)3 as a working fluid in the regenerative ORC shows that it has a net output power and thermal efficiency similar to MDM, and has the potential for use in medium-high temperature thermal utilization ORC systems. This study offers valuable insights for designing modified siloxane-based working fluids for medium-high temperature ORC applications.
