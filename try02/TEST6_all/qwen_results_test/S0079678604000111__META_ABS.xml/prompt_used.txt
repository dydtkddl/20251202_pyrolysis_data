You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Calcium phosphates as substitution of bone tissues Calcium phosphates with clinical applications are used in reconstructive surgery. When dealing with the repairing of a skeletal section, two extremely diverse routes could be initially considered: to replace the damaged part or to substitute it regenerating the bone. This second option is in fact the role played by calcium phosphates, which can be classified among the bioactive ceramics group. Bioceramics, and therefore, calcium phosphates, exhibit very good biocompatibility and bone integration qualities, and constitute the materials showing closest similarity to the mineral component of bone; this fact, together with their bioactivity, make them very good candidates for bone regeneration. This review is focused on calcium phosphate ceramics; therefore, it is important to analyse firstly the biological calcium phosphates as components of natural hard tissues, that is, bone and teeth, and then to look for synthetic methods able to produce calcium deficient carbonate apatites with nanometric size, i.e., showing similar features to the biological apatites. In the present work, we describe the synthesis procedures to obtain in the laboratory calcium deficient carbonate nanoapatite both in bulk and thin film forms, as well as the characterization methods applied to these materials, with particular incidence in the electron microscopy.
