You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of end of life photovoltaic solar panels and recovery of valuable components: A comprehensive review and experimental validation With the current rate of installation of photovoltaic (PV) modules, the total installed capacity is expected to reach 4500 GW by 2050. Given the average life of solar modules is 25 years, after their spent time the installed solar panels will eventually turn into waste. The waste from solar panel modules is expected to reach about 8600 tons by 2030 and it will further increase to 78 million tons by 2050. The waste solar panel should be discarded or recycled appropriately since the toxic substances released from them can affect human health and the environment. Therefore, there is a need to develop a recovery and recycling process for waste produced from solar modules. In this comprehensive work, we have summarized (i) the classification of photovoltaic technology, (ii) review the approaches embraced for photovoltaic (PV) waste management on a global level, (iii) the need for photovoltaic (PV) waste management and brief explanation on the recycling process (Mechanical, thermal, chemical and leaser methods) of solar cells. Also, experimental validation has been provided by the recovery of discrete components from End of Life (EoL) solar panels in an appropriate amount. The recovered material components from the modules were subjected to structural and chemical characterization to attest phase purity of the samples.
