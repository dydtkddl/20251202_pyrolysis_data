You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective production of singlet oxygen from zinc-etching hierarchically porous biochar for sulfamethoxazole degradation Porous carbons are appealing low-cost and metal-free catalysts in persulfate-based advanced oxidation processes. In this study, a family of porous biochar catalysts (ZnBC) with different porous structures and surface functionalities are synthesized using a chemical activation agent (ZnCl2). The functional biochars are used to activate persulfate for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation. ZnBC-3 with the highest content of ketonic group (CO, 1.25 at%) exhibits the best oxidation efficiency, attaining a rate constant (k obs) of 0.025 min−1. The correlation coefficient of the density of CO to k obs (R 2 = 0.992) is much higher than the linearity of the organic adsorption capacity to k obs (R 2 = 0.694), implying that CO is the intrinsic active site for persulfate activation. Moreover, the volume of mesopore (R 2 = 0.987), and Zeta potential (R 2 = 0.976) are also positive factors in PS adsorption and catalysis. In the mechanistic study, we identified that singlet oxygen is the primary reactive oxygen species. It can attack the –NH2 group aligned to the benzene ring to form dimer products which could be adsorbed on the biochar surface to reach complete removal of the SMX. The optimal pH range is 4–6 which will minimize the electrostatic repulsion between ZnBCs and the reactants. The SMX degradation in ZnBC/PS system was immune to inorganic anions but would compete with organic impurities in the real wastewater. Finally, the biochar catalysts are filled in hydrogel beads and packed in a flow-through packed-bed column. The continuous system yields a high removal efficiency of over 86% for 8 h without decline, this work provided a simple biochar-based persulfate catalyst for complete antibiotics removal in salty conditions.
