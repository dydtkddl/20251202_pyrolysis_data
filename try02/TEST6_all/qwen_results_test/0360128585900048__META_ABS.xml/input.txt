Modeling of smoldering combustion propagation Smoldering combustion of various natural and synthetic solid materials constitutes a substantial fire hazard; the process itself produces copious toxic gases and it can lead to flaming combustion. This review focuses on the coupled chemical and physical processes involved in self-sustained propagation of smoldering. The potential heat sources (gas-phase oxidation, oxidative polymer degradation. char oxidation) are examined, along with the heat sinks (polymer pyrolysis, water vaporization). It is concluded that, even for the most-studied case of cellulose, the chemical mechanisms involved in these processes are both too complex and too poorly understood to be included in a smolder propagation model. Greatly simplified kinetic schemes are currently inevitable; the kinetic parameters are empirical and of restricted usefulness. A general model of the thermophysics of propagation (for arbitrary chemistry) is presented as a benchmark against which to compare existing models. The general case, with gradients both on the scale of the particles that comprise the fuel and on the scale of the overall combustion wave moving through the fuel bed, is too complex to be tractable. The general model equations are non-dimensionalized: simplifications are noted in the limit of small or large values for certain dimensionless groups. Existing smolder propagation models in the literature are reviewed; all represent great simplifications of the general case and none closely describes a realistic smoldering fire hazard. The principal usefulness of existing models is in rationalizing certain experimentally-observed trends. Truly useful predictive models of realistic hazard situations remain to be developed.
