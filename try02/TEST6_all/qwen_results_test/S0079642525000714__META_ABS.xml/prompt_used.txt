You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring recent advances in the versatility and efficiency of carbon materials for next generation supercapacitor applications: A comprehensive review The study systematically evaluates various forms of carbon, including ACs, graphene, CNTs, CA, xerogels, template-derived carbons, heteroatom-doped carbons, and waste-derived carbons, highlighting their critical roles in improving the functionality of supercapacitors. ACs are explored for their high surface areas and porosity, detailing their production methods and impacts on enhancing electrochemical performance. The review further highlights graphene for its outstanding electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, discussing its synthesis techniques and contributions towards boosting the energy and power densities. Additionally, the work categorizes CNTs into SWCNTs and MWCNTs types, analyzing their synthesis methods and their influence on the conductivity and mechanical strength. Carbon aerogels and xerogels are examined for their production processes and key characteristics that translate into superior performance metrics within supercapacitors. Template-derived carbons are investigated through various templating methods, including hard, soft, and self-templating, assessing the resultant structural distinctions and performance improvements. The role of heteroatom doping in enhancing the electrochemical properties of carbons is also thoroughly discussed. Finally, the review concludes with an analysis of waste-derived carbons, utilizing various biomass precursors and conversion methods to highlight the environmental and cost benefits of these materials, alongside their performance in supercapacitor applications.
