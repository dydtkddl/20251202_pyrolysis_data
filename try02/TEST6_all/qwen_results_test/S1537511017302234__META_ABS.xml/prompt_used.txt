You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis in auger reactors for biochar and bio-oil production: A review Pyrolysis is the thermochemical decomposition of biomass under oxygen-limiting conditions used for biochar and bio-oil production. Depending on biomass feedstock, pyrolysis technology and operating parameters, product yields and properties will differ. Among the available pyrolysis units, auger pyrolysis is a polyvalent and promising technology for producing both bio-oil and biochar. These reactors are simple to operate and can be mobile, they require little or no carrier gas and low energy. Moreover, the operating parameters can be controlled easily in order to obtain the desired products. Recently, many research articles on biomass pyrolysis in auger reactors have been published. Design of laboratory-scale pyrolysis units and operating parameters differ considerably. Therefore, there was a need to list the studies in which auger pyrolysis reactors are used and to collect data for experimental operating parameters and product yields. The type and the capacity of the reactor, pyrolysis temperature, solid residence time, carrier gas flowrate, vapour residence time, and biomass feedstock type and size were identified as the parameters having the most influence on product yields and their properties. Because each pyrolysis reactor is unique, it is important to establish the relationship between operating parameters and product yields and their properties for each biomass feedstock. Future work is needed in order to provide simple solutions to scale-up laboratory-scale auger pyrolysis units to industrial size.
