You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis kinetic behavior and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of metallised food packaging plastics Metallised food packaging plastics waste (MFPW) is the most complex fraction of plastic waste ever. Pyrolysis treatment is one of the most promising technologies that could be used to convert the plastic fraction of MFPW into energy products and to recover aluminum fraction mixed with char. Within this frame, this research aims to study the volatile products released from pyrolysis of MFPW and their kinetics by using the TG-FTIR/GC–MS system. The experiments were performed on six different types of MFPW (potato chips, chocolate, bakery, coffee, and biscuits) and its mixture. The developed strategy started with analysis of the selected MFPW samples and the proximate analysis showed that the samples were rich with volatile matter content (till 99.5 wt%). In parallel, DMCHA dissolution treatment was used for preliminary experiments to determine the total number and types of plastic layers in MFPW confined to EVA, PET, and LDPE. Afterwards, the TG-FTIR system was used to investigate the thermal and chemical degradation of the MFPW samples up to 900 °C at different heating rates (5-30˚C/min), while the GC/MS system was used to study the volatile products generated from MFPW samples at the maximum decomposition temperatures (467-485˚C). Finally, the model-free methods (Kissinger, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa, and Friedman) were used to develop the kinetic model of pyrolysis of the MFPW samples. The results showed that the main decomposition of the MFPW samples happened in the range 360-500˚C with mass loss of 67–96%, while the kinetic models indicated that the mean activation energies for the mixture sample were estimated at 288.8 kJ/mol (Kissinger), 287.8 KJ/mol (KAS), 314.5 KJ/mol (FWO), and 307.9 KJ/mol (Friedman). Finally, the FTIR spectra and GC–MS results showed that Propene and Furan (7.6%), 2,4-Dimethyl-1-heptene and Isopropylcyclobutane (43.16%), etc. compounds were strongly present in the released volatile products.
