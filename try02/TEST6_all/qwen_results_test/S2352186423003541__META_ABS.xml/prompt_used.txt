You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emission characteristics of typical gas pollutants during oxygen-enriched waste incineration process Oxygen-enriched waste incineration can improve incineration efficiency and reduce pollutant generation, while greenhouse gases and pollutant emission characteristics of different wastes are still unclear. In this study, pollutant emission characteristics of actual municipal solid waste (MSW) and typical components at different oxygen concentrations and moisture content were investigated to reveal the pollutant generation mechanism. The results illustrated that when oxygen concentrations increased from 21% to 30%, CO, CH4 and HCN emissions decreased by 95%, 95.5% and 96.5%, respectively. NO emissions increased by 75% due to the promotion of oxygen on fuel NO and rapid NO. The slight increase in SO2 (from 25.8% to 26.87%) was due to the promotion of oxygen on organic S and the reaction between SO 4 2 − and HCl. The decrease in HCl emissions (from 78.42% to 76.85%) was caused by the increasing deacon reaction. Besides, with increasing moisture content, CO, CH4 and HCN generation decreased first because of the CO oxidation and CH4 reforming reaction, and then increased due to the water–gas reaction between fixed carbon and water. Furthermore, the moisture content contained (66%) would promote NO and HCl generation by 35.7% and 9.1% through fuel N oxidation by OH radicals and hydrolysis of chlorine salt at high temperatures. The increased oxygen concentration would inhibit the moisture influence and improve applicability for different MSW. In addition, 25% oxygen-enriched incineration was selected as the most suitable parameter for improving combustion efficiency and reducing pollutant emissions of MSW with high moisture content.
