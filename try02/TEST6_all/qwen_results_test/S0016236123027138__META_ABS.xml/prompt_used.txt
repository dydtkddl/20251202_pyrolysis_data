You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Harnessing marine biomass for sustainable fuel production through pyrolysis to support United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals Amid the global energy crisis and environmental concerns, marine biomass, specifically seaweed, serves as a type of marine biomass with potential for conversion into sustainable energy in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). There is a pressing need to shift towards sustainable energy resources, and seaweed emerges as an underexplored renewable energy source. A thorough analysis of past, current, and emerging trends in seaweed biomass conversion takes place. Thermochemical processes and other conversion methods are detailed, evaluating their efficiencies, limitations, and advancements. Due to its rapid growth and rich carbohydrate content, seaweed proves to be a prime candidate for bioenergy production. Converting seaweed aids in carbon capture, nutrient recycling, and waste management, which positively impacts several UN SDGs. Challenges, including technological barriers, economic feasibility, and environmental concerns related to large-scale seaweed farming and energy conversion, are present. The potential of marine biomass, especially seaweed, in sustainable energy production becomes evident, highlighting its intricate nature. Advancements in conversion technologies, thorough life-cycle assessments, and stringent sustainability protocols are recommended. Future efforts should concentrate on in-depth feasibility studies and foster inter-disciplinary collaborations to address the multifaceted challenges of this energy transition, aligning it with the UN's sustainability aspirations.
