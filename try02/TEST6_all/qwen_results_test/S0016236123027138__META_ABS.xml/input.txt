Harnessing marine biomass for sustainable fuel production through pyrolysis to support United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals Amid the global energy crisis and environmental concerns, marine biomass, specifically seaweed, serves as a type of marine biomass with potential for conversion into sustainable energy in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). There is a pressing need to shift towards sustainable energy resources, and seaweed emerges as an underexplored renewable energy source. A thorough analysis of past, current, and emerging trends in seaweed biomass conversion takes place. Thermochemical processes and other conversion methods are detailed, evaluating their efficiencies, limitations, and advancements. Due to its rapid growth and rich carbohydrate content, seaweed proves to be a prime candidate for bioenergy production. Converting seaweed aids in carbon capture, nutrient recycling, and waste management, which positively impacts several UN SDGs. Challenges, including technological barriers, economic feasibility, and environmental concerns related to large-scale seaweed farming and energy conversion, are present. The potential of marine biomass, especially seaweed, in sustainable energy production becomes evident, highlighting its intricate nature. Advancements in conversion technologies, thorough life-cycle assessments, and stringent sustainability protocols are recommended. Future efforts should concentrate on in-depth feasibility studies and foster inter-disciplinary collaborations to address the multifaceted challenges of this energy transition, aligning it with the UN's sustainability aspirations.
