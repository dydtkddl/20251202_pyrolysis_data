Transient analysis of solar pyrolysis and hydrogen yield via interband cascade laser absorption spectroscopy of methane, acetylene, ethylene, and ethane A mid-infrared laser absorption sensing method has been developed to measure species concentrations of four hydrocarbons and gas temperature over a range of temperatures in mixture compositions relevant to the pyrolytic decomposition of natural gas. The four measured species (methane, acetylene, ethylene, and ethane) are the most abundant hydrocarbons during the pyrolysis of natural gas, and provide a means to monitor decomposition progress and hydrogen yield through molar balance. In this work, time-division multiplexed signals of three distributed-feedback interband cascade lasers are used to make simultaneous measurements of select C-H stretch rovibrational transitions of the target hydrocarbons in the 3.00–3.34 μ m range. The sensor was validated over a range of temperatures and pressures (300–1000 K, 0.03–1 atm) at relevant mixture compositions, with correction methods developed to mitigate cross-species interference. The sensor was demonstrated on a solar-thermal pyrolysis reactor, where time-resolved measurements of species mole fractions were performed across a range of insolation conditions to capture the transient response of the reactor.
