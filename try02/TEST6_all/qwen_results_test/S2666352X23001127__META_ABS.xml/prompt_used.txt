You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transient analysis of solar pyrolysis and hydrogen yield via interband cascade laser absorption spectroscopy of methane, acetylene, ethylene, and ethane A mid-infrared laser absorption sensing method has been developed to measure species concentrations of four hydrocarbons and gas temperature over a range of temperatures in mixture compositions relevant to the pyrolytic decomposition of natural gas. The four measured species (methane, acetylene, ethylene, and ethane) are the most abundant hydrocarbons during the pyrolysis of natural gas, and provide a means to monitor decomposition progress and hydrogen yield through molar balance. In this work, time-division multiplexed signals of three distributed-feedback interband cascade lasers are used to make simultaneous measurements of select C-H stretch rovibrational transitions of the target hydrocarbons in the 3.00–3.34 μ m range. The sensor was validated over a range of temperatures and pressures (300–1000 K, 0.03–1 atm) at relevant mixture compositions, with correction methods developed to mitigate cross-species interference. The sensor was demonstrated on a solar-thermal pyrolysis reactor, where time-resolved measurements of species mole fractions were performed across a range of insolation conditions to capture the transient response of the reactor.
