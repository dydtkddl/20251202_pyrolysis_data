Global trends of waste tire pyrolysis research: a bibliometric analysis The rapid accumulation of end-of-life tires, driven by global vehicle use, presents severe environmental challenges. Each year, approximately 3 billion tires are produced globally, with 800 million reaching end-of-life, of which 41% are landfilled without material or energy recovery. Pyrolysis has emerged as a sustainable solution, converting waste tires into valuable by-products, including pyrolysis oil, gas, and recovered carbon black (rCB). This bibliometric review analyzes 1,431 publications (2000–2024) sourced from Scopus to map research trends, advancements, and gaps in tire pyrolysis. Three primary research hotspots are identified: (1) co-pyrolysis, emphasizing feedstock optimization and microwave-assisted methods to enhance efficiency and product quality, (2) pyrolysis oil, addressing challenges in upgrading for industrial use, and (3) recovered carbon black (rCB), focusing on advanced demineralization and activation techniques to improve its properties. Key challenges identified include feedstock variability, catalytic system optimization, and process scalability. This review provides insights and a strategic framework for advancing tire pyrolysis, fostering sustainable practices, and driving innovation across energy, materials, and environmental applications.
