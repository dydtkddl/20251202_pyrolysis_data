You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Global trends of waste tire pyrolysis research: a bibliometric analysis The rapid accumulation of end-of-life tires, driven by global vehicle use, presents severe environmental challenges. Each year, approximately 3 billion tires are produced globally, with 800 million reaching end-of-life, of which 41% are landfilled without material or energy recovery. Pyrolysis has emerged as a sustainable solution, converting waste tires into valuable by-products, including pyrolysis oil, gas, and recovered carbon black (rCB). This bibliometric review analyzes 1,431 publications (2000–2024) sourced from Scopus to map research trends, advancements, and gaps in tire pyrolysis. Three primary research hotspots are identified: (1) co-pyrolysis, emphasizing feedstock optimization and microwave-assisted methods to enhance efficiency and product quality, (2) pyrolysis oil, addressing challenges in upgrading for industrial use, and (3) recovered carbon black (rCB), focusing on advanced demineralization and activation techniques to improve its properties. Key challenges identified include feedstock variability, catalytic system optimization, and process scalability. This review provides insights and a strategic framework for advancing tire pyrolysis, fostering sustainable practices, and driving innovation across energy, materials, and environmental applications.
