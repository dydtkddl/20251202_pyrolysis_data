You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Methane decomposition for hydrogen production: A comprehensive review on catalyst selection and reactor systems The rampant global energy demand is predominantly met by fossil fuels, resulting in the reduction of their supply and an alarming increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These two challenges have fascinated the scientific community in finding solutions to these problems. Hydrogen (H2) as an energy carrier is considered as one of the solutions to address the challenges. Methane (CH4) decomposition is considered a favourable technology for the production of H2 and valuable by-products in the form of carbon nanomaterial. The H2 could be directly used for various applications such as fuel cell technology, transportation fuel, and for the synthesis of chemicals such as ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH). In the current scenario, demand for COx-free H2 has increased on an annual basis, either in terms of quantity or number of applications and the thermo-catalytic methane decomposition (CDM) process is gaining more attention to produce H2. To improve the H2 yield and quality of the structured carbon by-product, various approaches involving the catalyst and process parameters have been investigated. This review critically discusses various conventional and novel catalyst systems to identify the recent progress for CDM and the way forward. Furthermore, reactor system configurations powered by conventional and renewable energy sources for methane decomposition, as well as their working principles, technical advantages, and limitations are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the various potential applications of carbon nanomaterial are briefly devised.
