You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bridging sodium storage behavior and microstructure in broad-leaf lignin hard carbon for sodium-ion batteries Hard carbon (HC) has emerged as the most promising anode material for the sodium ion battery because high theoretical capacity and cost-effective properties. However, unsatisfactory specific capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) significantly impede its further advancement. Moreover, the correlation between the microstructure and electrochemical performance has been not thoroughly elaborated. Here, a straightforward approach to regulate the closed nanopore and defect structure in the hard carbon matrix by adjusting the pyrolysis temperatures. Higher pyrolysis temperature will promote the growth of a long carbon chain and further fold and shrink generating more closed nanopores, which was beneficial to improve the Na+ plateau capacity. The long-range ordered turbostratic graphite domain structure should be avoided, as it can lead to a reduction in reversible capacity. Through detailed analysis of the hard carbon microstructure evolution and electrochemical performance, the relationship of which has been established. Simultaneously, the optimized hard carbon pyrolyzed at 1500 °C displays a remarkable reversible specific capacity of 338 mAh g- 1 at 0.1 C with a high ICE of 87%. Based on the detailed analysis, a microstructure-dependent mechanism ‘adsorption-intercalation-filling’ was proposed for a comprehensive understanding of the sodium ion storage behavior. More significantly, fabricated 18650 cylindrical batteries demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 1175 mAh at 0.1 C with outstanding cycle stability (82.9% after 225 cycles at 0.5 C), outperforming commercial hard carbon counterparts. Our work provides deep insight into the rational design of the hard carbon structure and provides the possibility of building practical SIBs with high performance.
