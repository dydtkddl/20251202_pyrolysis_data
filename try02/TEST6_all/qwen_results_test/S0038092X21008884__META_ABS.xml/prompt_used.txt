You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of SMR process for syngas production through a solar-assisted thermo-chemical reactor with a multi-layered porous core A two-dimensional steady-state axisymmetric model is developed to analyze the performance of a thermo-chemical porous reactor used for syngas and subsequently hydrogen generation through the steam methane reforming (SMR) process. The finite volume method coupled with kinetics thermo-chemical reaction and local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model with modified P1 approximation is employed to obtain the temperature distribution for both the fluid and porous zones. First, the effects of inlet mass flow rate, inlet steam to methane ratio, porosity, number of pores per inch (PPI), permeability, and reactor length on reactor performance are scrutinized. Next, to optimize the performance of the reactor, an artificial neural network (ANN) is developed to obtain the maximum hydrogen generation rate concerning the effective parameters. Finally, a two-layer porous foam is utilized as the catalyst zone to further improve the performance. Results show that increasing inlet flow rate leads to temperature decline and causes an incomplete reaction. Also, increasing porosity enhances heat absorption at the inlet and decreases radiative heat transfer through the porous foam. At a specified condition ( m ̇ = 0.25 kg.h−1, XCH4/XH2O = 1/3, and PPI = 10), increasing the porosity from 0.6 to 0.8 has increased hydrogen production by 27 %, while by a further increase of porosity to 0.9, hydrogen production decreased by 3 %. Results indicate up to 164 % increment in the performance of the optimal case compared to the base case. Furthermore, employing the two-layer porous foam with different PPIs could further increase hydrogen production, up to 20 %, and reduced the pressure drop.
