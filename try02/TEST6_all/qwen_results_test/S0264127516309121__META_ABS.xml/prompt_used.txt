You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid): Physico-chemical characterization and targeted dye sensitized solar cell application A random poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) [P(MMA-co-BA-co-AA)] was synthesized via emulsion polymerization utilizing thermally-activated persulfate radicals. The successful synthesis of high molecular weight copolymer at high monomer conversion rate was confirmed by NMR study. Various techniques were employed to characterize the structure, electrical and thermal properties of copolymer. The removal of unreacted monomers from the end product by casting technique was rationalized from the disappearance of CC FTIR characteristic peak in the cast film. The drying of the emulsion above the glass transition temperature (T g =24°C) yields an amorphous film with smooth surface morphology. The suitability of the formed continuous film as a base polymer for iodide-based electrolytes in dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabrication was investigated. The polymeric solid state electrolytes (PSSE) were formulated by varying the doping concentrations of sodium iodide (NaI) in fixed ratio of iodine (I2) and mixtures of ethylene carbonate: propylene carbonate (EC:PC, 1:1). The DSSC fabricated using PSSE with 15wt.% NaI showed the highest solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiency (η) of 3.22% under 100mWcm−2 sunlight intensity. This implies that the physico-chemical properties of the synthesized copolymer are suitable for the development of photoelectrochemical device.
