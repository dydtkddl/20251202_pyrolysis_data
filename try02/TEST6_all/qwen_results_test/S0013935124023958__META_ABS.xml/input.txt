Pyrolytic conversion of cattle manure and acid mine drainage sludge into biochar for oxidative and adsorptive removal of the antibiotic nitrofurantoin Antibiotics in aquatic environments can foster the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing significant risks to both living organisms and ecosystems. This study explored the thermo-chemical conversion of cattle manure (CM) into biochar and assessed its potential as an environmental medium for removing nitrofurantoin (NFT) from water. The biochar was produced through the co-pyrolysis of CM and acid mine drainage sludge (AMDS) in a N2 condition. The gaseous and liquid products generated during pyrolysis were quantified and characterized. The biochar exhibited both catalytic and adsorptive capability in NFT removal. It effectively activated persulfate to drive oxidative degradation of NFT via radical (SO4 •- and •OH) and non-radical (1O2) pathways. NFT adsorption on the biochar involved multiple binding mechanisms, including electrostatic, hydrogen bonds, and π-π EDA interactions, as evidenced by XPS analysis before and after the reaction. Furthermore, the biochar's performance stability was demonstrated through five cycles of reuse and leaching tests. These findings present a viable approach to generate energy from waste by co-pyrolyzing of livestock manure and metal-containing industrial waste, while also producing environmental media capable of removing antibiotics from wastewater through diverse mechanisms.
