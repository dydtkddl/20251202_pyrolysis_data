You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic conversion of cattle manure and acid mine drainage sludge into biochar for oxidative and adsorptive removal of the antibiotic nitrofurantoin Antibiotics in aquatic environments can foster the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing significant risks to both living organisms and ecosystems. This study explored the thermo-chemical conversion of cattle manure (CM) into biochar and assessed its potential as an environmental medium for removing nitrofurantoin (NFT) from water. The biochar was produced through the co-pyrolysis of CM and acid mine drainage sludge (AMDS) in a N2 condition. The gaseous and liquid products generated during pyrolysis were quantified and characterized. The biochar exhibited both catalytic and adsorptive capability in NFT removal. It effectively activated persulfate to drive oxidative degradation of NFT via radical (SO4 •- and •OH) and non-radical (1O2) pathways. NFT adsorption on the biochar involved multiple binding mechanisms, including electrostatic, hydrogen bonds, and π-π EDA interactions, as evidenced by XPS analysis before and after the reaction. Furthermore, the biochar's performance stability was demonstrated through five cycles of reuse and leaching tests. These findings present a viable approach to generate energy from waste by co-pyrolyzing of livestock manure and metal-containing industrial waste, while also producing environmental media capable of removing antibiotics from wastewater through diverse mechanisms.
