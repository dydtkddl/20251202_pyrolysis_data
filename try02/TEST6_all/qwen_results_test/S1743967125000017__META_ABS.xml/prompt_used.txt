You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes and application of machine learning for modelling of the process: A comprehensive review The conventional fossil fuels which primarily include coal, oil and natural gas are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions (such as methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) into the atmosphere causing severe health consequences to human population. Different types of renewable energy feedstocks including biomass wastes are being investigated across the world. Out of various techniques for utilizing biomass, the pyrolysis has wide product profiles which can be used in different applications. Likewise, omnipresence of plastic waste, and its tremendous generation and lack of appropriate waste management system is also another environmental issue. Hence, co-pyrolysis (a thermochemical conversion) of biomass and plastic waste, presents an effective solution for the underlined issues as it not only provides a clean source of energy, but is also cost-efficient, easy to use, helps deal with the issue of plastic waste management as well as mitigate the concerns caused by the pyrolysis of single feedstock i.e., biomass. The quality of co-pyrolysis derived bio-oil can further be enhanced by incorporating catalyst. Operating condition of a pyrolysis process depends on the nature of feedstock, requirement of product distribution etc. Thus, optimization of process parameters is essential for making this process successful. Machine learning models can be utilized in the co-pyrolysis process as a tool to overcome the preceding issues by optimizing the process and also helps in process control, yield prediction and real-time monitoring. However, no prior study has conducted an in-depth review of current research scenario related to the machine learning approach in co-pyrolysis process.
