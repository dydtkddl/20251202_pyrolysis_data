You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation pathways of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans from burning simulated PVC-coated cable wires Open burning of PVC-coated cables is a major source of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F). In the present study, the formation characteristics of PCDD/F from burning of PVC-based samples with and without metallic copper were evaluated over the dioxin formation temperature window (200–500 °C). This temperature range also inevitably occurs under open burning conditions. The PCDD/F yield from PVC added with Cu increased by factors of 1390 (300 °C), 65 (400 °C) and 17 (500 °C) compared with that from PVC alone, confirming the stimulatory effect of metallic Cu on PCDD/F production. For the first time, a relatively complete isomer-specific analysis is established for PVC acting as source of PCDD/F. Formation pathways of PCDD/F and the reaction mechanisms were investigated using a combined analysis of PCDD/F isomer signatures, thermogravimetric results and Cl K-edge X-ray absorption spectra. De novo synthesis is the major pathway leading to massive production of PCDD/F. Copper extends the temperature range for the concurrence of de(hydro)chlorination of PVC with cross-linking and aromatisation of polyenes and then stimulates cracking of the chlorine-embedded carbon network. Together, these processes contribute to the strongly enhanced formation of PCDD/F via de novo synthesis.
