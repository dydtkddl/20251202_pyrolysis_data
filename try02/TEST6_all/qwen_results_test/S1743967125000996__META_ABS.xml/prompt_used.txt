You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence mechanism of AAEMs on the pyrolysis of coal density-separated fractions: Insights from combining TGA, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and in-situ EPR technique In this study, in-situ Raman and in-situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy combining thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were developed to investigate the effects of alkali and alkaline earth metallic species (AAEMs) on the evolution of Zhundong coal (a typical AAEMs-rich coal) density-separated fractions including 1.50 g/cm3 during pyrolysis. The inherent AAEMs in the Zhundong coal mainly exist as Na and Ca. For occurrence characteristics of AAEMs, the relative amount of ion-exchangeable AAEMs is close between density-separated fractions, and the water-soluble and HCl-soluble AAEMs mainly exist in the >1.50 g/cm3 fraction. The pyrolysis weight loss and the maximum mass loss rate (Rmax) decrease with the increases of the fraction's density. The chemical structure and the occurrence characteristics of AAEMs of density-separated fractions have a combined effect on their pyrolysis characteristics. At the devolatilization stage of the pyrolysis, water-soluble AAEMs promote the release of active components, accelerate the formation of more stable bonds between AAEMs and char matrix and inhibit the release of the 1–2 aromatic rings in char especially for the 1.50 g/cm3 fraction, and the coupling of free radicals especially for the 1.50 g/cm3 fraction. Good correlations between pyrolysis reactivity and in-situ chemical structure were found and established. It was expected to direct the coal utilization based on integrated cascade stages.
