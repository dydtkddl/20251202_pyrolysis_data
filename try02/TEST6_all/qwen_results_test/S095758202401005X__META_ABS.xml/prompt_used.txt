You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of rice straw pellets and plastic packaging wastes for value-added products and energy recovery The sustainable utilization of agricultural residues and waste plastics to mitigate environmental pollution, while generating renewable energy through pyrolysis has achieved significant attention through the years. In this study, microwave-assisted pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of plastic packaging wastes (PPW) and rice straw pellets (RSP) of different mixture compositions (10 % PPW, 20 % PPW, and 30 % PPW) have been carried out to evaluate the synergistic effect of the two different feedstocks on product yields, composition, energy recovery, energy and exergy efficiency. With an intention to avoid pulverization of the feedstocks to fine particle sizes, a unique configuration resembling a chocolate is adopted to mix the biomass pellet with sheets of PPW, while using activated carbon as a susceptor. The calorific value of the co-pyrolysis oil was higher (30–35 MJ kg−1) than the pyrolysis oil obtained from RSP (22–28 MJ kg−1). The maximum oil yield from co-pyrolysis was 40 wt% for a feed-to-susceptor ratio of 2.5:1 w/w, 10 % PPW at 600 °C, and 800 W microwave power. Compared to the pyrolysis of RSP, co-pyrolysis resulted in significant deoxygenation in the oil fraction (50–60 %). The oil composition data revealed an increase in aliphatic hydrocarbons from 37 % to 42 % along with increased aromatics from 13 % to 19 % when PPW content was increased from 10 % to 30 % in the feedstock. High energy recovery (∼91 %) and feed conversion efficiency (∼99 %) were recorded for 20 % PPW at 800 W and 600 °C. The net energy balance for co-pyrolysis was positive (9–16 MJ kg−1) at different reaction conditions, which proves the energetic feasibility of the process. At 800 W and 600 °C, the total exergy efficiency was maximum (57.7 %) for 10 % PPW feedstock, and the exergy efficiencies were lower than the energy efficiency values.
