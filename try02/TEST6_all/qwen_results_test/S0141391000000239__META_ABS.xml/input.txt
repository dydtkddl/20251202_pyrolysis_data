Catalytic conversion of polyolefins into fuels over zeolite beta The catalytic degradation of polypropylene and both low- and high-density polyethylene over different samples of zeolite beta has been investigated. Zeolite beta synthesized by the fluoride method has a low activity for the cracking of polyolefins, which is related to its large crystal size (12 μm) and poor aluminium incorporation. In contrast, zeolite beta synthesized from amorphous xerogels consists of small crystallites (⩽200 nm) and allows all the polyolefins to be degraded with high conversion (40–60%) and good selectivity towards C5–C12 hydrocarbons (60–70%), heavier products being hardly obtained (<6%). The incorporation of titanium into the BEA structure has been proved to enhance the catalytic activity, as denoted by the highest conversion per Al atom obtained with the Ti–Al-beta sample compared to Al-beta.
