You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on titanium oxide (TiO2) nanomaterials in multidomain investigations The unique properties of titanium led to the rigorous research of its nanoscale composite and alloy derivatives in biomedicine and photocatalysis. Despite this, more refinement is necessary in the surface modification of titanium nanomaterials (NMs) for the advancement of property and to reduce detrimental responses. A synthetic strategy for titanium NMs is planned in physical, chemical, and biochemical routes to accomplish desired properties and targeted implementation. Titanium oxide is studied as zero-dimensional, higher-dimensional, and different polymorphs. The structural and surface analysis is evaluated by several advanced techniques. Nanotechnology aims to produce titanium materials with nanoscale dimensions, modified surfaces, chemical stability, scalability, and high mechanical strength. Thus, it can act as the best candidate for multimode research. However, the invaluable number of literature summaries focused on the genotoxicity, bio-accumulation, and ecotoxicity resulting after prolonged implementation of the titanium oxide NMs, this can be combated with surface manipulation ability provided by the nanomaterial through the decoration of the surface with inorganic and organic moieties which enhanced the overall efficiency of the material. The current review is focused on the synthesis of TiO2 NMs, structural evaluations, toxicity, surface modification, and its implementations in the field of medicine, material development, and pollution control, including industrial applications such as cosmetics, food safety, and energy storage. Hence defining the titanium nanomaterial as a versatile material for multidomain research.
