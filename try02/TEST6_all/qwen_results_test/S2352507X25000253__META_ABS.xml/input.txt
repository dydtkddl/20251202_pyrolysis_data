Review on titanium oxide (TiO2) nanomaterials in multidomain investigations The unique properties of titanium led to the rigorous research of its nanoscale composite and alloy derivatives in biomedicine and photocatalysis. Despite this, more refinement is necessary in the surface modification of titanium nanomaterials (NMs) for the advancement of property and to reduce detrimental responses. A synthetic strategy for titanium NMs is planned in physical, chemical, and biochemical routes to accomplish desired properties and targeted implementation. Titanium oxide is studied as zero-dimensional, higher-dimensional, and different polymorphs. The structural and surface analysis is evaluated by several advanced techniques. Nanotechnology aims to produce titanium materials with nanoscale dimensions, modified surfaces, chemical stability, scalability, and high mechanical strength. Thus, it can act as the best candidate for multimode research. However, the invaluable number of literature summaries focused on the genotoxicity, bio-accumulation, and ecotoxicity resulting after prolonged implementation of the titanium oxide NMs, this can be combated with surface manipulation ability provided by the nanomaterial through the decoration of the surface with inorganic and organic moieties which enhanced the overall efficiency of the material. The current review is focused on the synthesis of TiO2 NMs, structural evaluations, toxicity, surface modification, and its implementations in the field of medicine, material development, and pollution control, including industrial applications such as cosmetics, food safety, and energy storage. Hence defining the titanium nanomaterial as a versatile material for multidomain research.
