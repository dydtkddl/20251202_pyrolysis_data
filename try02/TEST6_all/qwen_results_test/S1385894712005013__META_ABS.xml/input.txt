Performance of Fe/AC catalyst prepared from demineralized pine bark particles in a microwave reactor Activated carbon supported iron catalysts derived from pine bark were prepared by different methods using a microwave reactor. The catalyst samples were characterized by physical adsorption of N2, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The catalyst activity was evaluated for catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of phenol at 50°C. The results showed that the catalyst prepared by preloading the metal precursor to deashed biomass before carbonization and activation in a microwave reactor possessed much higher reactivity than catalyst prepared from other methods. The acid washing to remove ash from biomass eliminated the adverse effect of metals contained in the ash on catalyst, modified the biomass tissue which favored the catalyst dispersion on the biomass. The metal pre-loading to biomass led to a more uniform dispersion of catalyst on activated carbon. The microwave treatment saved energy, shortened preparation time. High catalytic activity for the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of phenol was observed for catalyst samples prepared from pre-loading the active metal to pre-deashed bark samples.
