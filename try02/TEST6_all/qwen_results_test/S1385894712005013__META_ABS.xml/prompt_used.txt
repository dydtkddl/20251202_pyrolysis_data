You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance of Fe/AC catalyst prepared from demineralized pine bark particles in a microwave reactor Activated carbon supported iron catalysts derived from pine bark were prepared by different methods using a microwave reactor. The catalyst samples were characterized by physical adsorption of N2, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The catalyst activity was evaluated for catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of phenol at 50°C. The results showed that the catalyst prepared by preloading the metal precursor to deashed biomass before carbonization and activation in a microwave reactor possessed much higher reactivity than catalyst prepared from other methods. The acid washing to remove ash from biomass eliminated the adverse effect of metals contained in the ash on catalyst, modified the biomass tissue which favored the catalyst dispersion on the biomass. The metal pre-loading to biomass led to a more uniform dispersion of catalyst on activated carbon. The microwave treatment saved energy, shortened preparation time. High catalytic activity for the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of phenol was observed for catalyst samples prepared from pre-loading the active metal to pre-deashed bark samples.
