Fueling sustainability: Co-pyrolysis of microalgae biomass and waste plastics for renewable energy and waste mitigation The rising worldwide need for energy, driven by industrial expansion, population increase, and transportation demands, poses a substantial issue. Microalgae are extremely promising raw materials for biofuel production, and pyrolysis is an efficient method of turning biomass into bioenergy. However, biofuels generated from microalgae pyrolysis frequently have inferior fuel characteristics due to high quantities of moisture and nitrogen. At the same time, population growth has resulted in a large increase in plastic trash, causing serious environmental issues. While some plastics are recycled, a large portion stays useless, adding to environmental issues. The present research looks at how to overcome these issues by investigating the co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and microalgae biomass. This technique provides synergistic benefits for both fuel and value-added product manufacturing. The resultant materials can be utilized as chemicals and to absorb pollutants, providing ecologically acceptable waste management solutions and supporting sustainability. Co-pyrolysis inhibits the transformation of oxygen and nitrogen to bio-oil in a highly efficient method, increasing oxygen release as H2O and nitrogen conversion to gas products. The paper fully examines the physicochemical features of microalgae biomass and waste plastics, offering a thorough overview. It also summarizes the present research state of microalgae biomass and plastic co-pyrolysis technology, highlighting the synergistic impacts and identifying future development opportunities. The review's last part addresses the economic feasibility, critical challenges, and the potential of co-pyrolysis processes, offering light on this method of waste disposal and sustainable energy generation.
