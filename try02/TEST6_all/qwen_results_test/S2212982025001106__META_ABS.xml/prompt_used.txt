You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanical robust and thermal insulated rPET microcellular foam via supercritical CO2 foaming cross-linked photovoltaic backsheet Upcycling of solar panels plays important role in the photovoltaic sustainability. However, their reprocessed foaming was limited due to the low melt strength of the backsheet material after long-term usage. Herein, we utilized chain extender (CE), a copolymer made of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and styrene to enhance the melt strength of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) via the formation of chemical cross-linking network. According to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum, the epoxy groups in GMA participated into cross-linking reaction since absorption peaks of 758 cm−1, 847 cm−1, 902 cm−1 and 1248 cm−1 assigned with epoxy group disappeared after reactive extrusion. Consequently, the glass transition temperature increased to 78.5 ℃, and the crystallinity decreased 37.7 % gradually with CE content of 5 %. Rheological results showed that the zero-shear viscosity dramatically increased to 19692.1 Pa·s, almost 100-folds for unmodified rPET, demonstrating the viscoelasticity transition from “liquid” viscos state to “solid” elastic rPET with incorporation of cross-linking agent. With the assistance of two-step supercritical CO2 foaming technology, the rPET microcellular foam with high compressive strength and thermal insulated performance can be developed. Specifically, the void fraction increased up to 85.6 %, the average cell size could decrease to 9.2 µm, the cell density increased up to 1.98 × 109 cells/cm3, thermal conductivity reduced to 48.5 mW/(m·K), the compressive strength of the rPET foam can reach up to 6.84 MPa. As a proof of concept, this work provides a novel route to develop mechanical robust and thermal insulated rPET microcellular foam for resource utilization of disposed photovoltaic backsheet.
