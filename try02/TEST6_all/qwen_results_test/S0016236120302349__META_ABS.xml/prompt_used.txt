You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydroisomerization of long-chain bio-derived n-alkanes into monobranched high cetane isomers via a dual-component catalyst bed The hydroisomerization of n-hexadecane (n-C16) was tested by using two sets of bifunctional catalytic systems. In the first series, the activity of Pt and Ni catalysts supported on AlSBA-15 with reference to the catalysts prepared with commercial SiO2Al2O3 is compared. The use of AlSBA-15 as a support yielded the Pt and Ni catalysts of an activity allowing n-C16 conversion at temperature lower by 50 °C as compared to the SiO2Al2O3 supported counterparts. The highly active Pt/AlSBA-15 catalyst provides the maximum selectivity to i-C16 amounting to 86.3% at 59% of n-C16 conversion. In the second series, n-C16 hydroisomerization has been investigated using the composite catalytic system consisting of Pt/AlSBA-15 as the main component and 25 wt% of Pt/ZSM-22 as the co-catalyst. As a result, a significantly improved selectivity towards the most desired products of mono-branched isomers (i.e. 67%) with the highest contribution 2- and 3-methylpentadecanes could be achieved under mild reaction conditions.
