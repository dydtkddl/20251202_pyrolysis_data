Microalgae in the Mediterranean area: A geographical survey outlining the diversity and technological potential Microalgal diversity enables the possibility to employ them in technological applications, as widely shown by the modern literature. While there exists an extensive body of literature concerning the technological applications of microalgae, the scientific knowledge of microalgal species remains relatively limited. Therefore, there is still potential for unlocking new opportunities through the study of the microalgal biodiversity, particularly in the Mediterranean region, which is unique because of its sub regional diversity. While some studies have assessed microalgae distribution in the Mediterranean area, and others have focused on specific aspects of their technical exploitation, this review seeks to offer a comprehensive overview of isolated microalgal species and their technological applications. Microalgae from the Mediterranean area share common characteristics, such as low half-saturation constants and acclimation to high light intensity, making them ideal for specific technological applications. While the search for new microalgae for technological purposes can help in biodiversity conservation, numerous species still remain underexplored, offering potential for innovative applications. However, the key finding from the critical analysis of the literature is that the diversity of microalgae in the Mediterranean region is its true richness, allowing for their versatile applications across various processes. The work focuses on the Mediterranean area, i.e., having coastlines along the Mediterranean Sea and on aquatic microalgae, coming from water with different salinity levels. This review offers an intrinsic ecological and technological perspective and provides a fresh outlook on the microalgal sector, promoting its expansion in the Mediterranean area and the development of sustainable bio-industries.
