You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microalgae in the Mediterranean area: A geographical survey outlining the diversity and technological potential Microalgal diversity enables the possibility to employ them in technological applications, as widely shown by the modern literature. While there exists an extensive body of literature concerning the technological applications of microalgae, the scientific knowledge of microalgal species remains relatively limited. Therefore, there is still potential for unlocking new opportunities through the study of the microalgal biodiversity, particularly in the Mediterranean region, which is unique because of its sub regional diversity. While some studies have assessed microalgae distribution in the Mediterranean area, and others have focused on specific aspects of their technical exploitation, this review seeks to offer a comprehensive overview of isolated microalgal species and their technological applications. Microalgae from the Mediterranean area share common characteristics, such as low half-saturation constants and acclimation to high light intensity, making them ideal for specific technological applications. While the search for new microalgae for technological purposes can help in biodiversity conservation, numerous species still remain underexplored, offering potential for innovative applications. However, the key finding from the critical analysis of the literature is that the diversity of microalgae in the Mediterranean region is its true richness, allowing for their versatile applications across various processes. The work focuses on the Mediterranean area, i.e., having coastlines along the Mediterranean Sea and on aquatic microalgae, coming from water with different salinity levels. This review offers an intrinsic ecological and technological perspective and provides a fresh outlook on the microalgal sector, promoting its expansion in the Mediterranean area and the development of sustainable bio-industries.
