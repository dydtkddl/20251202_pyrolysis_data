Advanced processes in biomass/waste valorization: A review The growing concern related to climate change and the depletion of non-renewable resources has generated significant interest in sustainable practices for the valorization of industrial waste, aiming to convert them into higher added value products. This approach helps reduce the large amounts of waste in landfills, decrease greenhouse gas emissions and allows for the reuse and valorization of materials considered as waste. This contribution was aimed to provide an overview on the valorization of different waste materials from agricultural, forestry, and food, which represent abundant resources. An emphasis on continuous flow processes has been put in the provided examples as the way forward to potentially more scalable processes. Additionally, a feasibility analysis was conducted regarding the valorization of these biomass resources in the specific areas targeted. The results show promising approaches to obtain various products and energy sources from these largely inutilized waste sources, promoting a circular and sustainable economy focused on waste utilization.
