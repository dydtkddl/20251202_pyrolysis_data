The latest advances in two-way shape memory polymers: Fabrication strategies, programming mechanisms, and emerging applications Two-way shape memory polymers (2W-SMPs), as a class of intelligent materials capable of reversibly switching between two predefined configurations under external stimuli, have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their broad application prospects in soft robotics, biomedical devices, and adaptive systems. This review systematically reports recent advances in 2W-SMPs, with a focus on their fabrication strategies, actuation mechanisms, and performance optimization. The relationship between polymer structure and performance is discussed, and the design strategy of the 2W-SMPs based on single-crystal and two-crystals phases that integrate the chemical and physical programming for distinct morphing behavior is delineated from a molecular design point of view. Lastly, a summary of this type of materials in practical applications like light-controlled microactuators, self-expanding vascular stents, and bioinspired soft robots, as well as future research on theoretical guidance and technological perspectives for the development of next-generation of 2W-SMPs are presented.
