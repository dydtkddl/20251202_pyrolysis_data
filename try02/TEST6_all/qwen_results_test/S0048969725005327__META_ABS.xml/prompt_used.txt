You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on applications of microreactors for the treatment of polluted water with organic dyes The scale-down of reaction processes by microreactors enables significant benefits over the applications of conventional reactors due to the intensification of reaction which become an emerging prospect in the environmental engineering. In the last decades, there has been a rapid pollution increase connected with various industries, in particular due to the dye and textile industries, which generate huge amounts of wastewater containing organic dyes. The abatement of dyes in wastewater using microreactors therefore has great potential. This paper reviews a rapidly emerging area of microreactors applications in the removal of dyes from polluted water and describes a survey on recent advances in the development of microreactors in this area. With respect to the nature of the treatment technique, the scope of the literature was divided into several categories - Fenton reaction, ozonation, photocatalytic degradation, reductive degradation, biotreatment, and separative sequestration. This review focusses on summarizing different configurations of reaction conditions of the respective treatment techniques, their efficiency, and, mainly, the characteristics including design, construction materials, and fabrication of microreactors applied. The evaluation and evolution of treatment techniques have also been critically analyzed, and future perspectives are proposed in this work. From the present study, it can be concluded that several treatment methods can be applied for removal of organic dyes in a wide range of microreactor designs. Furthermore, this work showcases how microreactor technology may improve mass transfer as well as treatment efficiency. A novelty of the this review article lies in (i) data analysis with emphasis on reaction conditions as well as microreactor designs, and, based on this, in (ii) the proposition of decision-making algorithm which can facilitate a designing of the dyes removal in microreactors.
