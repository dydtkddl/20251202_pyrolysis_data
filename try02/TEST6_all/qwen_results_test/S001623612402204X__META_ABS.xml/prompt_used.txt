You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fractional distillation of waste plastic pyrolysis oil for isolating narrow hydrocarbons cuts Pyrolysis of polyolefins generates a large amount of olefins, which can serve as a valuable feedstock for the synthesis of chemicals. Nevertheless, their effective utilization requires refining owing to their diverse carbon distribution. This study performed a comprehensive GC×GC analysis of pyrolysis oils derived from waste polypropylene (PP) and waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The chemical composition of PP pyrolysis oil exhibited a high content of iso-olefins, whereas HDPE pyrolysis oil contained mainly alpha-olefins. Experimental batch distillation of PP pyrolysis oil yielded narrow hydrocarbon cuts with iso-olefins content exceeding 70 wt%. In contrast, distillation of HDPE resulted in cuts with more than 25 wt% alpha-olefins content. To perform ASPEN simulations, the physical properties (density, viscosity) of the oil were determined, two ways for obtaining boiling curves (ASTM D2887 and ASTM D86) were compared and two property methods (Peng-Robinson and Soave-Redlich-Kwong) were compared. It was concluded that the ASTM D2887 boiling curve and the Peng-Robinson property method present better experimental agreement for pyrolysis oils using the Theil’s Inequality Coefficients test. Based on the validated batch simulation, continuous distillation process schemes for isolating narrow carbon cuts in the refinery atmospheric tower indicate that a side draw configuration provides a better yield of (19.1 wt%) compared to a dedicated separate distillation column of (11.9 wt%) for the same number of trays, while the dedicated column allows the possibility to achieve higher purity.
