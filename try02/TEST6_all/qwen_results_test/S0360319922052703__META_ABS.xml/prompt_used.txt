You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphitic carbon-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles embedded 1D porous hollow carbon nanofibers as advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries Physical mixing of monofunctional noble metal catalysts, such as Pt/C or Ru/IrO2, increases the commercial cost and stability risk of electrodes. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a multifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries and integrated electrolytic devices. To develop an effective way to fabricate high-performance multifunctional electrocatalysts by modifying advanced nanostructures, a coaxial electrospinning approach with in-situ synthesis and subsequent carbonization was used to construct a highly integrated three-function catalyst composed of graphitic carbon-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles embedded into one-dimensional (1D) porous hollow carbon nanofibers (CoNC-HCNFs). Under the synergistic effect of the active material and the advanced nanostructure, the as-prepared CoNC-HCNFs demonstrated an operating overpotential of 186 mV (10 mA cm−2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a potential of 1.58 V (10 mA cm−2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With their exceptional multifunctional activities, two CoNC–HCNF-based aqueous zinc-air batteries (ZABs) in series could drive an alkaline water electrolyzer for splitting water. Furthermore, due to the superior mechanical flexibility and rechargeability of the solid-state ZAB, it has great application prospects in powering portable and wearable electronics. This research is expected to offer inspiration for the development of other excellent MOF-based hollow carbon nanofibers and to enable them to be adopted more widely in electrochemical energy conversion and energy storage.
