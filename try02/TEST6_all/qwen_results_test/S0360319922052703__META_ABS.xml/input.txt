Graphitic carbon-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles embedded 1D porous hollow carbon nanofibers as advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries Physical mixing of monofunctional noble metal catalysts, such as Pt/C or Ru/IrO2, increases the commercial cost and stability risk of electrodes. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a multifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries and integrated electrolytic devices. To develop an effective way to fabricate high-performance multifunctional electrocatalysts by modifying advanced nanostructures, a coaxial electrospinning approach with in-situ synthesis and subsequent carbonization was used to construct a highly integrated three-function catalyst composed of graphitic carbon-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles embedded into one-dimensional (1D) porous hollow carbon nanofibers (CoNC-HCNFs). Under the synergistic effect of the active material and the advanced nanostructure, the as-prepared CoNC-HCNFs demonstrated an operating overpotential of 186 mV (10 mA cm−2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a potential of 1.58 V (10 mA cm−2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With their exceptional multifunctional activities, two CoNC–HCNF-based aqueous zinc-air batteries (ZABs) in series could drive an alkaline water electrolyzer for splitting water. Furthermore, due to the superior mechanical flexibility and rechargeability of the solid-state ZAB, it has great application prospects in powering portable and wearable electronics. This research is expected to offer inspiration for the development of other excellent MOF-based hollow carbon nanofibers and to enable them to be adopted more widely in electrochemical energy conversion and energy storage.
