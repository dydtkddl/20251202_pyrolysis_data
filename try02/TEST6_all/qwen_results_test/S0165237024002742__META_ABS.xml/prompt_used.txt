You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic conversion of nylon-6 and red mud into N-doped carbon composite and its application into azo-dye degradation The continuous growth of the global population and industries has led to the mass generation of plastic and industrial waste, posing significant environmental challenges due to their incompatibility with conventional waste management practices. This study investigates the thermochemical conversion of plastic (nylon-6) and industrial waste (red mud) into value-added products, presenting a waste-to-resource conversion strategy. Nylon-6 and red mud were co-pyrolyzed, resulting in a metal-carbon composite characterized as porous N-doped graphitic carbon with embedded Fe0 particles. Application of the composite to an amaranth solution demonstrated its ability to activate persulfate, facilitating amaranth oxidation at a rate (k obs = 1.78 min−1) significantly higher than other Fe-based catalysts. Quenching experiments verified the generation of OH· and SO4 ·- radicals during activation, with the latter playing a dominant role in amaranth degradation. The composite exhibited robust reusability, maintaining an amaranth removal efficiency of >80 % after five reaction cycles. Additionally, red mud significantly enhanced syngas (H2 and CO) generation from nylon-6, suggesting a catalytic effect. In conclusion, the proposed thermochemical approach offers a viable method for converting waste materials into valuable products, including environmental catalysts and gas fuels.
