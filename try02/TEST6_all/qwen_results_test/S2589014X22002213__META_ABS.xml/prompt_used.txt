You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of wheat husk and residual tyre: Techno-economic analysis, performance and emission characteristics of pyro oil in a diesel engine The Wheat husk and the residual tyre were thermochemically converted to fuel in a single stage fixed bed reactor. The elemental analysis of the wheat husk and residual tyre indicated higher volatile matter. The higher heating value of residual tyre was 36.20 MJ/kg. The thermogravimetric study indicated the temperature of co-pyrolysis as 500 °C. Pyro oil yield was studied for 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, 0:1 blends of wheat husk and residual tyre. Gas chromatography and Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of aromatic compounds in the pyro oil. The wheat husk – residual tyre pyro oil’s kinematic viscosity was 3.8 cSt. Co-pyrolysis produces fuel with higher energy content. The maximum brake thermal efficiency of the wheat husk - residual tyre pyrolysis oil is 29.4 %. Carbon monoxide emission from the blended fuel was 0.12 %. The cost of pyro oil was ₹ 32.50/L Residual tyre has been effectively converted into fuel.
