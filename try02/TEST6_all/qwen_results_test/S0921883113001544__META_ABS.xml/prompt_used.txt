You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodynamic behavior of binary mixture of solids in a triple-bed combined circulating fluidized bed with high mass flux Flow behaviors of binary mixture of silica sand and nylonshot (coal char substitute) were investigated in a triple-bed circulating fluidized bed (TBCFB) as a cold model of coal gasifier. The TBCFB consisted of a downer (ϕ 0.1m×6.5m), a bubbling fluidized bed (0.75m×0.27m×1.9m), a riser (ϕ 0.1m×16.6m) and a gas-sealing bed (GSB, ϕ 0.158m×5m). The initial fraction of the nylonshot in the solid mixture (Xnylon,i ) was 15.4 and 30% on mass and volume bases, respectively, or otherwise, 30.7 and 50%. The maximum solids mass flux (Gs ) at Xnylon,i of 15.4 and 30.7wt% were 394 and 349kg/m2 s, respectively, when the gas velocity in the riser (Ugr ) was 10m/s. Apparent solids holdups of silica sand and nylonshot were calculated separately from the static pressure gradient across the riser and the downer. The results showed possibility of large-mass-flux circulation of char in the gasifier, which plays a significant role in decomposition of tar from pyrolysis as the primary step of gasification. A newly developed pressure balance model successfully predicted Gs of the binary mixtures in TBCFB.
