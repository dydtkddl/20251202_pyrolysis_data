You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of addition of the scrap tires and waste plastics pyrolysis oil residue on the quality of the feed for hydrocracking and FCC Pyrolysis oil residue (360 °C+) from scrap tires (yield 37 wt%) and waste plastics (yield 10 wt%) has been considered for coprocessing with vacuum distillates by hydrocracking and with atmospheric residue by FCC. The effect of adding of 10 wt% pyrolysis oils residue on the quality of the feedstock of both processes was evaluated. The general properties, fractional, chemical, and elemental composition of pure feedstocks and their mixtures were analyzed. The homogeneity of all feedstocks and compatibility of mixed samples were verified by spot test and observation under the optical microscope. In the coprocessing of scrap tires pyrolysis oil residue, it will be necessary to pay attention to the high acid and iodine numbers, aromatics, iron and nickel content, and the tendency to carbonize, while for the waste plastics pyrolysis oil residue, it will be necessary to pay attention to the high nitrogen and chlorine content. Coprocessed feedstocks were compatible. With FCC technology, both pyrolysis oil residues can be coprocessed; for hydrocracking technology, the waste plastics pyrolysis oil residue will by more convenient. The results will be used to scale up the coprocessing of pyrolysis oil residues.
