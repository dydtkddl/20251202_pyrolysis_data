Effect of addition of the scrap tires and waste plastics pyrolysis oil residue on the quality of the feed for hydrocracking and FCC Pyrolysis oil residue (360 °C+) from scrap tires (yield 37 wt%) and waste plastics (yield 10 wt%) has been considered for coprocessing with vacuum distillates by hydrocracking and with atmospheric residue by FCC. The effect of adding of 10 wt% pyrolysis oils residue on the quality of the feedstock of both processes was evaluated. The general properties, fractional, chemical, and elemental composition of pure feedstocks and their mixtures were analyzed. The homogeneity of all feedstocks and compatibility of mixed samples were verified by spot test and observation under the optical microscope. In the coprocessing of scrap tires pyrolysis oil residue, it will be necessary to pay attention to the high acid and iodine numbers, aromatics, iron and nickel content, and the tendency to carbonize, while for the waste plastics pyrolysis oil residue, it will be necessary to pay attention to the high nitrogen and chlorine content. Coprocessed feedstocks were compatible. With FCC technology, both pyrolysis oil residues can be coprocessed; for hydrocracking technology, the waste plastics pyrolysis oil residue will by more convenient. The results will be used to scale up the coprocessing of pyrolysis oil residues.
