A study on the characteristics and kinetic of co-catalytic pyrolysis with rape straw and ABS waste plastics TG analysis, kinetic model and fixed-bed experiments were applied in this study to explore the synergistic effect of rape straw (RS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) in the co-catalytic pyrolysis. The results showed that the preferential pyrolysis of RS was favorable for the formation of some active radicals and decreased the pyrolysis temperature of ABS from about 400 °C to 350 °C. As the mixing ratio of ABS rose, the temperature range of co-pyrolysis decreased gradually. The interaction between the free radicals generated by RS and ABS was effectively promoted with the addition of HZSM-5, and also the aromatization was accelerated. The temperature range of co-pyrolysis was decreased from 350 °C to 400 °C–340 °C–380 °C. The Flynn-Wall Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) were used to build the kinetics model, and revealed that the activation energy of co-pyrolysis system reached the bottom with the mixing ratio was 1:1, indicating the strongest synergistic effect at this point. The synergistic action was revealed from the kinetic analysis. In the fixed-bed test, the yield of liquid phase (54.15 %) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) (32.87 %) peaked at the mixing ratio of 1:1, at which the synergistic effect inhibited the conversion to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
