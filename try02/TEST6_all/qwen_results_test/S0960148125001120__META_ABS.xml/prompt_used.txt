You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study on the characteristics and kinetic of co-catalytic pyrolysis with rape straw and ABS waste plastics TG analysis, kinetic model and fixed-bed experiments were applied in this study to explore the synergistic effect of rape straw (RS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) in the co-catalytic pyrolysis. The results showed that the preferential pyrolysis of RS was favorable for the formation of some active radicals and decreased the pyrolysis temperature of ABS from about 400 °C to 350 °C. As the mixing ratio of ABS rose, the temperature range of co-pyrolysis decreased gradually. The interaction between the free radicals generated by RS and ABS was effectively promoted with the addition of HZSM-5, and also the aromatization was accelerated. The temperature range of co-pyrolysis was decreased from 350 °C to 400 °C–340 °C–380 °C. The Flynn-Wall Ozawa (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) were used to build the kinetics model, and revealed that the activation energy of co-pyrolysis system reached the bottom with the mixing ratio was 1:1, indicating the strongest synergistic effect at this point. The synergistic action was revealed from the kinetic analysis. In the fixed-bed test, the yield of liquid phase (54.15 %) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) (32.87 %) peaked at the mixing ratio of 1:1, at which the synergistic effect inhibited the conversion to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
