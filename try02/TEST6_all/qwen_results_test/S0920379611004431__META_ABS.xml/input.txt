Technical issues related to the development of reduced-activation ferritic/martensitic steels as structural materials for a fusion blanket system Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels are recognized as the primary candidate structural materials for fusion blanket systems. Because of the possibility of creating sound engineering bases, such as a suitable fabrication technology and a materials database, RAFM steels can be used as structural materials for pressure equipment. Further, the development of an irradiation database in addition to design methodologies for fusion-centered applications is critical when evaluating the applicability of RAFM steels as structural materials for fusion-neutron-irradiated pressure equipment. In the International Fusion Energy Research Centre (IFERC) project in the Broader Approach (BA) activities between the EU and Japan, R&D is underway to optimize RAFM steel fabrication and processing technologies, develop a method for estimating fusion-neutron-irradiation effects, and study the deformation behaviors of irradiated structures. The results of these research activities are expected to form the basis for the DEMO power plant design criteria and licensing. The objective of this paper is to review the BA R&D status of RAFM steel development in Japan, especially F82H (Fe–8Cr–2W–V, Ta). The key technical issues relevant to the design and fabrication of the DEMO blanket and the recent achievements in Japan are introduced.
