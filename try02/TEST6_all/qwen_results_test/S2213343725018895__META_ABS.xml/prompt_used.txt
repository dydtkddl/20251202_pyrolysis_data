You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of a two-stage fluidized bed system for hydrogen production by catalytic gasification of municipal solid waste The H2 content and composition of syngas produced using two-stage fluidized bed gasification with various bed materials were investigated in this study. The stage-one and stage-two operating temperatures were fixed at 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively, and the equivalence ratio (ER) and steam to biomass ratio (S/B ratio) were optimized. The stage-two bed materials were activated carbon (AC) from coconut shells (CS-AC) or Chinese pistache (CP-AC) with or without pretreatment by immersion in Ni(NO3)2 with various Ni concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, or 5 wt%) followed by calcination for 3 h at 500 °C. For all bed materials, the syngas H2 content was maximized at an ER value of 0.3 and an S/B ratio of 0.5; the best result (H2 content of 34.60 mol%) was achieved for CS-AC. For the Ni-treated bed materials, the highest H2 yields of 37.33 and 37.31 mol% were respectively obtained for CS-AC and CP-AC treated in 1 and 2 wt% Ni solutions. The Ni-treated stage-two bed materials consistently produced syngas with higher H2 content than the untreated material, validating the effectiveness of the coating method.
