Optimization of a two-stage fluidized bed system for hydrogen production by catalytic gasification of municipal solid waste The H2 content and composition of syngas produced using two-stage fluidized bed gasification with various bed materials were investigated in this study. The stage-one and stage-two operating temperatures were fixed at 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively, and the equivalence ratio (ER) and steam to biomass ratio (S/B ratio) were optimized. The stage-two bed materials were activated carbon (AC) from coconut shells (CS-AC) or Chinese pistache (CP-AC) with or without pretreatment by immersion in Ni(NO3)2 with various Ni concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, or 5 wt%) followed by calcination for 3 h at 500 °C. For all bed materials, the syngas H2 content was maximized at an ER value of 0.3 and an S/B ratio of 0.5; the best result (H2 content of 34.60 mol%) was achieved for CS-AC. For the Ni-treated bed materials, the highest H2 yields of 37.33 and 37.31 mol% were respectively obtained for CS-AC and CP-AC treated in 1 and 2 wt% Ni solutions. The Ni-treated stage-two bed materials consistently produced syngas with higher H2 content than the untreated material, validating the effectiveness of the coating method.
