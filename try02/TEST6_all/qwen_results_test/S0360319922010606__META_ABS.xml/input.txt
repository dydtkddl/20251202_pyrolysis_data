Catalytic hydropyrolysis of crop straws with different biochemical composition In this study, four kinds of straws with different biochemical compositions, including soybean straw (SS), peanut straw (PS), rice straw (RS), and corn straw (CS), were subjected to catalytic hydropyrolysis (HyPy) to explore the influence of biochemical composition on the products distribution and properties of the pyrolysis oil. The HyPy reactions were performed at 400 °C for 2 h with added 10 wt% Pd/C and 4 MPa H2. During the HyPy, hydrogen and catalyst broke the coating structure and hydrogen bond between cellulose (CL) and hemicellulose (HCL), and thus significantly weakened the biochemical composition effect on the yield and elemental composition of the bio-oil. The bio-oil yield varied between 11.75 wt% and 13.05 wt%, and the C, H, N, O, and S content fell into the following ranges of 82.06–85.15 wt%, 9.24–9.61 wt%, 1.18–1.43 wt%, 4.62–7.86 wt%, 45–130 ppm, respectively. Biochemical composition of straw, especially the mass ratio of CL to HCL (m CL/m HCL), markedly influenced the molecular composition of the bio-oil. Hydrocarbons (20.15–46.66%) and phenolic compounds (17.01–47.98%) accounted for the vast majority of the identified compounds. SS and PS with higher m CL/m HCL (1.92 and 1.80, respectively) tended to produce bio-oils with more aromatics (22.63% and 20.70%, respectively) and fewer phenolic compounds (17.01% and 22.56%, respectively).
