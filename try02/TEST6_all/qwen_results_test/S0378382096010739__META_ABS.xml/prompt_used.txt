You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Depolymerization-liquefaction of plastics and rubbers. 2. Polystyrenes and styrene-butadiene copolymers The depolymerization-liquefaction reactions of representative polystyrene and styrene-butadiene co-polymer (non-vulcanized SBR) samples were systematically investigated as a function of processing variables, i.e. temperature (350–450°C), time (15–120 min), H2 pressure (500–2500 psig), and the presence of catalysts. Two solid superacids, i.e. Fe2O3 SO4 2− and ZrO2 SO4 2− , which differ in acidity were used in the study. The detailed composition of products was determined by GC/MS. Typical products from a polystyrene sample (average MW, 280 000) contained benzene, toluene, (C2C5) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, 1,3-diphenylalkanes and triphenylalkanes, accompanied by some indanes, tetralins, naphthalenes and polyphenyls, whereas products from non-vulcanized SBR (MW, 140 000) contained, in addition to the above, C5C9 paraffins and cycloparaffins, (C5C8) alkyl- and alkenylbenzenes, cyclopentylbenzenes, and cyclohexylbenzenes. The changes in product composition as a function of the above processing variables were determined and conditions for preferential (> 85 wt.%) production of gasoline-range liquid fuels established. The observed change in composition as a function of reaction time and temperature allowed for elucidation of mechanistic aspects of high-temperature depolymerization-liquefaction processes, including the role of catalytic effects.
