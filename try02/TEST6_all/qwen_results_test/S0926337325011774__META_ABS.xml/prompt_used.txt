You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isoeugenol Hydrodeoxygenation over Sustainable Biochar-Supported Cobalt Catalysts: Synergistic Co⁰/Co²⁺ Sites and Mechanistic Insights This work demonstrates the potential of low-cost cobalt catalysts supported on activated biochars from biomass on the hydrodeoxygenation of isoeugenol, bio-oil model compound for the production of sustainable aviation fuels. Co/biochar catalysts were obtained by pyrolysis and steam activation of rice husk, leather waste, and their mixture, followed by metal impregnation, calcination, and reduction. Compared to Co/AC, (commercial active carbon), Co/A-RH, (rice husk biochar), exhibited competitive isoeugenol conversion to propylcyclohexane (PCH) at 300 °C, 30bar, 4h, with a higher initial rate (r0PCH = 0.38 vs 0.34mmol/min gCo), but lower PCH yield (55% vs 75%), due to hydrocracking. By kinetic modeling, the activation energy for PCH formation was determined to be 151kJ/mol. Comprehensive characterization revealed that Co0-Co2+ synergy enhances HDO performance. DFT calculations provided mechanistic insight into the HDO pathways, which were consistent with the experimentally derived reaction network, and kinetic model.
