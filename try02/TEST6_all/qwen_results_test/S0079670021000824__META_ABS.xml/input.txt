Towards the Development of Green Flame Retardancy by Polybenzoxazines Flame retardation research is an old field that has recently received attention due to the societal need of developing greener materials and methodologies that do not compromise human health. This comprehensive literature review covers recent studies of benzoxazine resins used to create more environmentally-friendly flame retardants. To obtain greener flame retardant polybenzoxazine, additives such as natural renewable materials and more benign approaches for the chemical structure modification of benzoxazine, such as smart-chemistry as well as greener polybenzoxazines with higher intrinsic flame retardancy are employed. This review presents a comprehensive discussion of recent advances concerning the design of structure, the preparation, and properties of benzoxazines adopted for flame retardation.
