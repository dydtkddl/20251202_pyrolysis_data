You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transformation of biomass and waste plastic mixtures into hydrocarbon oils and gases by pyrolysis using different reactor temperatures and pressures In this work the laboratory scale pyrolysis and gasification of biomass and plastic waste mixtures were investigated at different temperatures (450°C and 750°C) and reactor pressures (0.1 bar and 1.0 bar). The main decomposition reactions and the effect of the process parameters were followed through the product yields and compositions of gases and pyrolysis oils. Less residue and significantly more gases had been found at higher temperature, which phenomena was more notable in case of higher proportion of plastic waste in the raw material mixtures. The concentration of hydrogen in gases changed by opposite trend at 450°C and 750°C as function of biomass ratios. The hydrogen and CO ratio can also increase by the increasing in plastic proportion of raw materials at both temperatures and pressures. Regarding the pressure, it can increase the pyrolysis and gasification reactions resulted higher yields of gases and lower oil/water ratios. More hydrogen and less C2-C6 compounds were found using 0.1 bar reactor pressure. Pyrolysis-oil contained aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons; n-paraffin, n-olefin, aldehyde, ketones, alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, etc. Due to deoxygenation reactions, hydrocarbons with less oxygen-containing compounds were found at 0.1 bar pressure.
