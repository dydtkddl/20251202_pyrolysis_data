You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the effect of alumina porous media on the polyethylene waste pyrolysis with continuous feed This study investigates the pyrolysis of polyethylene waste in a continuous-feed mode to provide novel insights into recycling waste plastics. Alumina (Al2O3) porous media has been introduced into the pyrolysis reactor to study its effect on continuous-feeding plastic waste pyrolysis. The pyrolysis product yields, oil fractions, and gas components have been determined under varying porous media structures, i.e., thickness and pore size, and operating parameters, i.e., temperature and gas-carrying velocity. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to investigate the influence of porous media pore size on the thermal decomposition of waste polyolefin in continuous feeding mode. The results reveal that higher thicknesses and smaller pore sizes of porous media can enhance the properties of pyrolysis oil with lower heavy fractions (>C20). The aromatization of light olefins is triggered when the temperature exceeds 520 °C, resulting in a rapid increase in light fraction (<C12) in pyrolysis oil. Moreover, the gas-carrying velocity determines the pyrolysis product distribution by regulating the volatiles' residence time.
