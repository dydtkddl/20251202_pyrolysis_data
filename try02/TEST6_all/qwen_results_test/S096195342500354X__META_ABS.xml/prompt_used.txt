You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass-to-biohydrogen conversion: Comprehensive analysis of processes, environmental, and economic implications Access to clean energy is essential for mitigating global warming and combating climate change, making the transition to renewable energy sources a critical global priority. This review presents a detailed and systematic analysis of biomass-to-biohydrogen conversion pathways, encompassing biological and thermochemical methods, with a focus on their environmental and economic implications. Dark fermentation, photofermentation, and thermochemical processes are thoroughly examined to provide insights into their mechanisms, efficiency, and potential for large-scale applications. The review also explores emerging hybrid technologies, such as combining dark and photofermentation or integrating thermochemical processes with bio-electrochemical systems, which optimize resource utilization and hydrogen yields. Additionally, innovative approaches like magnetic nanoparticles, artificial microbial consortia, and microwave-assisted pyrolysis demonstrate significant potential in overcoming current technological and economic barriers. Through life cycle assessments, this review compares the environmental impacts and sustainability of these pathways, revealing that renewable biomass feedstocks and process efficiencies are pivotal to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental burden. Thermochemical processes offer higher hydrogen yields but associated with greater carbon intensity and operational complexity. In contrast, biological routes present lower environmental impact but face constraints in scalability and conversion efficiency. Hybrid systems demonstrate promising balance, though their development remains at early technology readiness levels (TRLs). This review highlights the urgent need for standardized sustainability metrics and interdisciplinary strategies to address pre-treatment challenges, economic feasibility, and policy integration. Finally, this work provides a unified and comparative perspective across biomass-to-biohydrogen pathways, serve as foundation for future innovation and energy policy toward scalable, low-emission, and economically viable hydrogen solutions aligned with global decarbonization goals.
