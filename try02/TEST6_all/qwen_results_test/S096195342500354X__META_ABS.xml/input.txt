Biomass-to-biohydrogen conversion: Comprehensive analysis of processes, environmental, and economic implications Access to clean energy is essential for mitigating global warming and combating climate change, making the transition to renewable energy sources a critical global priority. This review presents a detailed and systematic analysis of biomass-to-biohydrogen conversion pathways, encompassing biological and thermochemical methods, with a focus on their environmental and economic implications. Dark fermentation, photofermentation, and thermochemical processes are thoroughly examined to provide insights into their mechanisms, efficiency, and potential for large-scale applications. The review also explores emerging hybrid technologies, such as combining dark and photofermentation or integrating thermochemical processes with bio-electrochemical systems, which optimize resource utilization and hydrogen yields. Additionally, innovative approaches like magnetic nanoparticles, artificial microbial consortia, and microwave-assisted pyrolysis demonstrate significant potential in overcoming current technological and economic barriers. Through life cycle assessments, this review compares the environmental impacts and sustainability of these pathways, revealing that renewable biomass feedstocks and process efficiencies are pivotal to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental burden. Thermochemical processes offer higher hydrogen yields but associated with greater carbon intensity and operational complexity. In contrast, biological routes present lower environmental impact but face constraints in scalability and conversion efficiency. Hybrid systems demonstrate promising balance, though their development remains at early technology readiness levels (TRLs). This review highlights the urgent need for standardized sustainability metrics and interdisciplinary strategies to address pre-treatment challenges, economic feasibility, and policy integration. Finally, this work provides a unified and comparative perspective across biomass-to-biohydrogen pathways, serve as foundation for future innovation and energy policy toward scalable, low-emission, and economically viable hydrogen solutions aligned with global decarbonization goals.
