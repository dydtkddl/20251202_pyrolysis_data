You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of Polymer Wastes as Transport Fuel Resources- a Recent Development Used plastic polymer is one of the major wastes in the developed countries like Australia. Australia is spending a lot of money each year to process solid wastes in land filling which are not biodegradable and can be a threat to the environment in the long run. About 19% of the overall plastic wastes are recycled every year in Australia. The incineration processes of plastic wastes lead to severe air pollution, too. Since the plastic polymers are originated from the petroleum resources, the possible technologies of converting them into fuel have drawn attention to meet the future fuel demand. Thus, converting the plastic polymers into transport fuel through a cleaner combustion process will contribute to saving environment. It has been observed that the thermal fuel conversion technology, known as thermolysis and the dissolution process of plastic polymers into an acceptable bio-solvent can lead to reduction of plastic wastes effectively. This paper presents a review on various thermolysis processes and the dissolution effect of various plastic polymers into bio-solvents. The technical features of converting polymers into fuel through appropriate and optimal technologies for the fuel production also have been analyzed. The authors have undertaken further studies on developing alternative fuel processing technologies to utilize polymer wastes as a resource, thus reducing environmental contaminant in an effective way.
