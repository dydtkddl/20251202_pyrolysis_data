You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Slurry co-hydroprocessing of Kraft lignin and pyrolysis oil over unsupported NiMoS catalyst: A strategy for char suppression Pyrolysis oil (PO) assisted Kraft lignin (KL) liquefaction over an unsupported NiMoS catalyst in a paraffin solvent was explored in this work. A paraffin solvent was used to represent hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) which is a biofuel. We have for the first time showed that when co-processing Kraft lignin with pyrolysis oil in a paraffin solvent the char formation could be completely suppressed. The complex composition of PO, containing various compounds with different functional groups, was able to aid the depolymerization pathways of lignin by obstructing the condensation path of reactive lignin derivatives. To further understand the role of different functional groups present in pyrolysis oil during lignin liquefaction, we investigate the co-hydroprocessing of Kraft lignin with various oxygenate monomers using unsupported NiMoS. 4-propylguaiacol (PG) was found to be the most efficient monomer for stabilizing the reactive lignin intermediates, resulting in a low char yield (3.7%), which was 4 times lower than the char production from Kraft lignin hydrotreatment alone. The suppressed rate of lignin fragment repolymerization can be attributed to the synergistic effect of functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), methoxy (-OCH3), and propyl (-C3H7) groups present in PG. These groups were found to be able to stabilize the lignin depolymerized fragments and blocked the repolymerization routes enabling efficient lignin depolymerization. It was found that the presence of a co-reactant like PG during the heating period of the reactor acted as a blocking agent facilitating further depolymerization routes. Finally, a reaction network is proposed describing multiple routes of lignin hydroconversion to solid char, lignin-derived monomers, dimers, and oligomers, explaining why the co-processing of pyrolysis oil and Kraft lignin completely suppressed the solid char formation.
