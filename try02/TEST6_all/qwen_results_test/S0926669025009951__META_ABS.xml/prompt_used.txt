You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermally conductive phase change composites featuring electrospun lignin nanofiber carbon aerogels for efficient solar-thermal energy conversion and storage Phase change materials (PCMs) have been recently introduced as key thermal energy storage medium in several thermal applications, specifically in solar thermal energy. However, the feasibility of their application in solar thermal storage has been limited by leakiness during solid-liquid phase conversion, low thermal conductivity, and low energy conversion rate. Herein, the poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based PCMs (LNCAs/PEG/E51) were constructed via vacuum impregnation technology, employing the electrospinning lignin nanofiber carbon aerogels (LNCAs) as the supporting materials, heat conduction path and photothermal agent. And the in situ cross-linking epoxy resin (E51) was used to further prevent leakage and enrich the thermal conductive network. The thermal conductivity of LNCAs/PEG/E51 was 0.67 W·m−1·K−1, which was about 3 times higher than that sample without the LNCAs. It also exhibited a high latent heat of fusion (87.95 J·g−1), favorable stability over 100 heating-cooling cycles, and thermal stability below 224.78 ℃. The solar-thermal energy conversion and storage efficiency of LNCAs/PEG/E51was higher to 81.72 % owning to efficient non-radiative transition of electrons. For the first time, we used LNCAs as support, thermal conductive and photothermal matrix for PCMs. The study established a channel for simultaneous high-value utilization of lignin and solar energy, which has reference value to some extent.
