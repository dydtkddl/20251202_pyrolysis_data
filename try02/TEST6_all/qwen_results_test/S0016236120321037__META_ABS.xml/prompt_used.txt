You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass ash characterization, fusion analysis and its application in catalytic decomposition of methane The biomass utilization for power generation is one of the efficient pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the high ash formation in biomass fed power plants raises several concerns, especially ash handling and its utilization. In this study, the biomass ash characterization, ash fusion analysis and its utilization as a catalyst in methane (CH4) decomposition were systematically investigated. The biomass bottom ash (BBA) and biomass fly ash (BFA) were modified using laboratory synthesized CeO2 nanoparticles to enhance the fusion temperature. The BBA, BFA and modified CeO2-BBA/BFA samples were characterized by ultimate analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis to investigate the physicochemical properties and its suitability for the catalysis applications. The detailed characterization inferred that BFA has significant potential in improving the ash fusion temperature as well as suitable for catalysis of fuel processing due to the presence of metal oxides such as Fe2O3, SiO2, CaO, Al2O3 and its porous structure. Furthermore, the most suitable BFA was impregnated with cobalt (Co). Co loaded BFA was employed for CH4 decomposition at 700 °C for H2 production in a fixed bed reactor. The Co/BFA demonstrated a stable catalytic activity of more than 330 min on stream with optimum H2 yield of 30%. The direct employment of BFA as catalyst support shows potential in further catalytic applications and material applications.
