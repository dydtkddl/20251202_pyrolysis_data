You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of softwood with waste mussel shells: Liquid analysis Fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) from lignocellulosic feedstocks can be limited to applications such as heating due in part to the high oxygen and resulting acid content of the oil which complicates storage, handling, and use in traditional petroleum-based systems. Research has been carried out to enhance the oil quality, both catalytically and non-catalytically. This work focuses on utilizing by-product from the fisheries industry as a co-pyrolysis additive to enhance oil quality. Mussel shells (MS) were co-pyrolyzed with softwood forestry residues in a lab-scale, tube furnace reactor. The pyrolysis temperature (400–525 °C), nitrogen flow rate (50–300 mL/min), wood-to-MS ratio (0–50 wt% MS), and operational mode (in-situ and ex-situ) were varied in a designed experiment. The produced pyrolysis oils were analyzed for water content (Karl-Fischer titration), high heating value (HHV), total acid number (TAN), pH, density, volatility and ash content via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and chemical composition via gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and C/H/N(O) elemental analysis. Co-pyrolysis with MS in-situ decreased the TAN of FPBO from 68 to 48mgNaOH/gOil), while the water content increased from 29 wt% to 39 wt%. However, the HHV of the water free oil increased from 22.4 to 23.6 MJ/kg indicating a reduction in oxygenated compounds, and therefore, an improvement in fuel quality of FPBO.
