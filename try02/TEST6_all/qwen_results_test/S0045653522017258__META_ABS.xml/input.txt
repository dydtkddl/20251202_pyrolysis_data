Elimination of microplastics from the aquatic milieu: A dream to achieve Microplastics (MPs) have become a significant source of concern as they have emerged as a widespread pollutant that harms the aquatic environment. It has become an enormous challenge, having the capacity to biomagnify and eventually affect human health, biodiversity, aquatic animals, and the environment. This review provides in-depth knowledge of how MPs interact with different toxic organic chemicals, antibiotics, and heavy metals in the aquatic environment and its consequences. Membrane technologies like ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), microfiltration (MF), and dynamic membranes can be highly effective techniques for the removal of MPs. Also, hybrid membrane techniques like advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), membrane fouling, electrochemical processes, and adsorption processes can be incorporated for superior efficiency. The review also focuses on the reactor design and performance of several membrane-based filters and bioreactors to develop practical, feasible, and sustainable membrane technologies. The main aim of this work is to throw light on the alarming scenario of microplastic pollution in the aquatic milieu and strategies that can be adopted to tackle it.
