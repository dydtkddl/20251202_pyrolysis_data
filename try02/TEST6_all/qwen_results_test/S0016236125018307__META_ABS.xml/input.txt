Co(salen)-based hyper-crosslinked porous ionic polymer as heterogeneous synergistic catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides The incorporation of various active sites with task-specific functions within porous organic polymer is crucial for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and catalysis. A bifunctional hyper-crosslinked porous ionic polymer [Co(salen)-HPiP)] bearing Co(salen) complexes and pyridinium ionic liquids was synthesized via a simple and low-cost synthetic method. Co(salen)-HPiP had an improved specific surface area, good CO2 adsorption capacity, high CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity, high density of nucleophilic/electrophilic sites (bromide/cobalt ions), and robust physiochemical stability. Co(salen)-HPiP was then employed as a synergistic heterogeneous catalyst for the solvent-additive-free synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides. Thanks to its unique porous structure, high CO2 affinity and easily accessible dual active sites, Co(salen)-HPiP demonstrated outstanding catalytic performance under mild conditions. To our delight, Co(salen)-HPiP also exhibited good substrate expansibility and robust reusability with retention of catalytic performance. Notably, the intrinsic CO2/N2 selective adsorption rendered this catalytic protocol still highly effective for the cycloaddition of the simulated flue gas (15% CO2 in 85% N2, v/v). This work offers a sustainable strategy for developing multifunctional heterogeneous PiP-based catalysts and presents a promising platform for the chemical fixation of real-world CO2.
