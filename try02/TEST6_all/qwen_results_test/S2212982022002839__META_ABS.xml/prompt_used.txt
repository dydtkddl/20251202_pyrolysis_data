You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of lactic acid from biodegradable straw waste through a CO2-assisted thermochemical process Although biodegradable straws are widely used, they are often unsuitable for disposal in open environments and cannot be recycled in the same manner as conventional plastic straws. Hence, an effective disposal method needs to be developed. Herein, the thermochemical conversion of biodegradable straws made mostly of polylactic acid (PLA) was considered, and the effects of CO2 on the characteristics of thermochemical products produced from biodegradable straws were explored. The thermochemical conversion of the biodegradable straw in CO2 atmosphere yielded more non-condensable gases than the thermochemical conversion in N2 owing to an enhanced thermal cracking of volatiles at 800 °C. At temperatures > 600 °C in CO2, the reverse water-gas shift reaction considerably increased the CO selectivity. Using CO2 in the thermochemical conversion decreased yields of char and wax, which was attributed to CO2 enhancing thermal cracking of volatiles evolved during the thermochemical conversion and C–H and O–H bonds present in the feedstock. The CO2 thermal agent promoted the cleavage of the polymeric bond of PLA to produce up to 14-fold more lactic acid (the monomer of PLA) than that produced with N2 agent, while it suppressed radical reactions to produce fewer phenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Thermochemical treatment in a CO2 environment has a significant feature of upcycling biodegradable plastic waste, such as biodegradable straws.
