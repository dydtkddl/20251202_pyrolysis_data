Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of solid waste for production of high-value liquid oil, syngas, and carbon solids: A review In recent years, microwave-assisted pyrolysis has gained prominence for solid waste treatment and energy recovery due to its unique heating methods. Compared to conventional pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis enhances control of reaction processes and product distribution, offering either improved product yields or qualities. This study is motivated by the necessity to gain a thorough understanding and harness the advantages of microwave-assisted pyrolysis. It aims to elucidate the underlying principles, operational concepts, and potential applications of the technology. The primary subject is on conversion of solid waste into valuable products such as syngas, bio-liquids, and carbon solids. Furthermore, the implications of reactor designs, material use, and operating conditions were examined for future improvements in pyrolytic efficiency and to address existing gaps in research. Kinetic studies were also summarized for presenting fundamental theory of microwave pyrolysis. The other main contribution of this review is that the final section listed the real-world applications of microwave pyrolysis on solid waste management, including cost and profitability considerations. This effectively connects theoretical laboratory investigations with real-world projects, offering valuable insights and paving the way for potential research directions.
