You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of solid waste for production of high-value liquid oil, syngas, and carbon solids: A review In recent years, microwave-assisted pyrolysis has gained prominence for solid waste treatment and energy recovery due to its unique heating methods. Compared to conventional pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis enhances control of reaction processes and product distribution, offering either improved product yields or qualities. This study is motivated by the necessity to gain a thorough understanding and harness the advantages of microwave-assisted pyrolysis. It aims to elucidate the underlying principles, operational concepts, and potential applications of the technology. The primary subject is on conversion of solid waste into valuable products such as syngas, bio-liquids, and carbon solids. Furthermore, the implications of reactor designs, material use, and operating conditions were examined for future improvements in pyrolytic efficiency and to address existing gaps in research. Kinetic studies were also summarized for presenting fundamental theory of microwave pyrolysis. The other main contribution of this review is that the final section listed the real-world applications of microwave pyrolysis on solid waste management, including cost and profitability considerations. This effectively connects theoretical laboratory investigations with real-world projects, offering valuable insights and paving the way for potential research directions.
