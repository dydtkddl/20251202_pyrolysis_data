You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combined hydrothermal pretreatment of agricultural and forestry wastes to enhance anaerobic digestion for methane production The dense structure and significant differences in the properties of agricultural and forestry wastes make it difficult to achieve anaerobic conversion. This study employed hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) and combined hydrothermal pretreatment (CHTP) to enhance the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of agricultural and forestry organic wastes. At a specific hydrothermal condition of 140℃ for 30 mins, the cumulative methane production of garden waste (GW), chicken manure (CM), duck manure (DM), and pig manure (PM) increased by 14.70%, 14.18%, 27.48%, and 21.81%, respectively. Under the same conditions, CHTP of garden waste with livestock and poultry manures showed noticeable synergistic effects, resulting in the methane production potential of garden waste mixed with chicken manure, duck manure, and pig manure increased by 28.82%, 36.59%, and 37.56%, respectively, compared with the untreated group. Metabolomic analysis showed that CHTP could significantly promote the decomposition of biomass carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, leading to increased levels of small molecular metabolites. Analysis of microbial community diversity showed that HTP and CHTP increase the abundance of specific functional microbial communities, such as hydrolysis bacteria and methanogens, thereby promoting the anaerobic production of methane from biomass waste. Energy balance analysis shows that HTP-AD and CHTP-AD have a positive net energy benefit. This study provides an efficient CHTP technology and theoretical support for the resource utilization and energy conversion of agricultural and forestry wastes.
