You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A conceptual investigation for a novel CO2-self-supplied integrated reactor containing ethane thermal cracking and CLC processes In recent years, numerous efforts have been made to enhance ethane thermal cracking performance, reduce environmental pollution, and save energy. In this study, the combination of the ethane thermal cracking and the chemical looping combustion (CLC) in a multi-tubular integrated reactor has been investigated. The suggested reactor consists of two concentric cylinders with some tubes embedded in the inner cylinder. The oxidation reaction of nickel as a suitable oxygen carrier is considered to be performed in the internal cylinder (air reactor). This reaction provides the essential thermal energy for reduction reaction in the external cylinder (fuel reactor) and the ethane thermal cracking process. Thus, this configuration leads to the elimination of thermal furnace in this process. Therefore, the environmental pollutants such as CO2 and NOx, as well as the operational costs, are significantly reduced. On the other hand, by this novel configuration, the ethylene and hydrogen production rates are improved in the ethane thermal cracking process. According to the results, the ethylene and hydrogen production yield increases by about 14% and 17%, respectively, compared to the conventional reactor of the ethane cracking process. The effects of design on the system performance have also been studied.
