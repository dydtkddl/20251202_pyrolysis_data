A conceptual investigation for a novel CO2-self-supplied integrated reactor containing ethane thermal cracking and CLC processes In recent years, numerous efforts have been made to enhance ethane thermal cracking performance, reduce environmental pollution, and save energy. In this study, the combination of the ethane thermal cracking and the chemical looping combustion (CLC) in a multi-tubular integrated reactor has been investigated. The suggested reactor consists of two concentric cylinders with some tubes embedded in the inner cylinder. The oxidation reaction of nickel as a suitable oxygen carrier is considered to be performed in the internal cylinder (air reactor). This reaction provides the essential thermal energy for reduction reaction in the external cylinder (fuel reactor) and the ethane thermal cracking process. Thus, this configuration leads to the elimination of thermal furnace in this process. Therefore, the environmental pollutants such as CO2 and NOx, as well as the operational costs, are significantly reduced. On the other hand, by this novel configuration, the ethylene and hydrogen production rates are improved in the ethane thermal cracking process. According to the results, the ethylene and hydrogen production yield increases by about 14% and 17%, respectively, compared to the conventional reactor of the ethane cracking process. The effects of design on the system performance have also been studied.
