You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review on enzymatic polymer degradation: A sustainable solution for plastics Synthetic plastics have been present in ecosystems for decades, and the increasing usage of plastic polymers has been a serious environmental challenge. The enzymatic polymer biodegradation, catalyzed by microbes, can address this issue by metabolizing the carbon from the polymer chain and decomposing it into simpler constituents. The key enzymes include hydrolase, lipase, cutinase, and peroxidase produced by diverse microorganisms and are responsible for the biodegradation of polymers. The present review has focused on several techniques of polymer biodegradation facilitated by enzymes through specific modes of action. The impact of enzymatic biodegradation of polymers on environmental sustainability has been thoroughly examined. This involves the microorganisms like fungi and bacteria, which utilize the substrate and depolymerize it. Microorganisms, such as bacterial species Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Ideonella, release various enzymes. Fungal species, specifically Pseudozyma, Candida, Fusarium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and the composite microorganisms involved in the biodegradation of polymers, have been studied extensively. Plastic deterioration occurs through aerobic and anaerobic processes, depending on the oxygen presence or oxygen absence conditions. The aerobic process operates efficiently and achieves total breakdown more rapidly than the anaerobic process. Aerobic degradation generates biogas, a renewable energy source, whereas anaerobic degradation creates methane-like gases, causing environmental issues. Oxidation and hydrolysis are the two reaction types involved in plastic biodegradation. The current investigation examines various plastics, including polyethene, polyurethane, polyethene terephthalate, polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride, and their biodegradation mechanisms facilitated by different enzymes.
