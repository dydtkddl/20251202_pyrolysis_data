You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignocellulosic bioplastics in sustainable packaging – Recent developments in materials design and processing: A comprehensive review Lignocellulosic materials, despite their abundance and attractiveness, have long been marred with challenges in optimising the cost-functionality-quality trade-off. This comprehensive authoritative review paper explores how various lignocellulosic feedstock have been utilised to prepare marketable and sustainable bioplastics, as potential substitutes to conventional petroleum-based packaging. Dependence on hydrocarbon-derived plastics is increasingly being supplanted by both consumer-driven and sustainability-oriented materials design. This comprehensive paper encompasses a broad review relating to recent research (2013−2023) on the innovations and heuristic approaches to modify lignocellulose for the production of packaging films. The review paper holds extensive focus across various lignocellulosic materials such as - but not limited to - cellulose nanomaterials, cellulose esters and grafted cellulose. Advances in processes reported to date such as mechanochemical, chemical, thermochemical, biochemical and other novel methods have been studied. The materials design and process implications in terms of its cost, energy input and sustainability in its true sense, for all known techniques have been extensively investigated in this review paper. The review paper has further provided an elaborate process-structure-property-performance framework that characterises how material properties could be fine-tuned via different process considerations. A techno-economic feasibility overview for said processes and materials' use is also described herein.
