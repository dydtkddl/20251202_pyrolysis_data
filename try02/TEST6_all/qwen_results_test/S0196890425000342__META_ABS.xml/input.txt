Pyrolysis of plastic waste for sustainable energy Recovery: Technological advancements and environmental impacts The global plastic waste crisis requires innovative solutions, and pyrolysis has emerged as a promising technology. This review critically examines pyrolysis technologies for plastic waste management, focusing on their efficiency, economic potential, and environmental impact. Pyrolysis can convert 60 %–80 % of plastic waste into liquid fuels, with yields of up to 85 % in fast pyrolysis processes conducted at temperatures between 450 °C and 600 °C. The process also reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 40 %, mitigating 3.5 tons of CO2-equivalent per ton of plastic waste processed. Economically, pyrolysis oil can be sold for $600–$900 per ton, while syngas, with a market value of $200–$300 per ton, can generate up to 800 kWh of electricity per ton of waste. Challenges include high energy requirements and the need for more efficient catalysts, which could improve liquid fuel yields by an additional 15 %. Future research should prioritize developing cost-effective and durable catalysts, improving energy efficiency in large-scale reactors, and integrating renewable energy sources to further enhance sustainability. Additionally, supportive policies and market strategies are crucial for enabling large-scale adoption of pyrolysis technologies.
