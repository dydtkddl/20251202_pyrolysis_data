Engineering of metal organic framework (MOF) membrane for waste water treatment: Synthesis, applications and future challenges This review paper emphasizes the significance of MOF materials (membranes) in addressing the global water crisis and the increasing need for sustainable water treatment technologies. MOF membrane has vast range of applications in waste water treatment due to their porous nature and ability of selective permeation and very high surface area. The increasing demand for clean and safe drinking water has led to significant advancements in the field of MOF material-based membranes, which have shown promising results in water filtration and purification. This review article provides extensive overview regarding various methods employed in the fabrication of the MOF membranes such as direct growth, secondary growth, interfacial polymerization, blending and also discusses post-synthetic defect modification. The review paper also summarizes the application of MOF membranes in water treatment, particularly in the removal of oily and micro-pollutants, pesticides, organic dye waste, heavy metals, and desalination of brackish water and seawater. Finally, the current challenges and opportunities are summarized in synthesis of MOF based membranes for wastewater treatment.
