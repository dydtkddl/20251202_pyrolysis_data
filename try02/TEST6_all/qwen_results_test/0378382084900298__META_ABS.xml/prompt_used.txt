You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading of wakefield browncoal from south Australia A sample of Wakefield browncoal, which is of very poor quality, was subjected to various treatments to improve the calorific value and remove contaminants. The best coal product, with a calorific value of 30 MJ/kg, was obtained by hydrothermal upgrading: 91% of the combustibles present in the feedstock were concentrated in 34% of the original weight. Moreover, an amount of liquid products was generated in a yield of up to 10 wt% on dry intake. Via a Fleissner treatment ca. 70% of the inherent moisture was removed as a liquid, leaving a product whose calorific value is expected to be almost 20 MJ/kg. Via carbonization smokeless fuels can be produced with a heating value of ca. 28 MJ/kg and yields of 50–60%, depending on the temperature. From this particular browncoal, most of the silica fraction of the mineral matter was extracted by rinsing with water, thus reducing the ash content by 50% and the ash fusion temperature by almost 200°C. By combined thermal upgrading and washing, most of the contaminants, i.e., sodium and chlorine, and half of the amount of oxygen and sulphur were removed. On the basis of experiments with micro-gasification test equipment, Wakefield browncoal and its upgraded product seem attractive feedstocks for gasification from a reactivity point of view. The lowering of the ash fusion temperature as observed in washed products is important for the reduction of the reactor outlet temperature when gasifying under slagging conditions, which has a favourable effect on the thermal efficiency.
