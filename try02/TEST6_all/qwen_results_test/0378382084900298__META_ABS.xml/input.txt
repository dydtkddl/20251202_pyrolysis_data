Upgrading of wakefield browncoal from south Australia A sample of Wakefield browncoal, which is of very poor quality, was subjected to various treatments to improve the calorific value and remove contaminants. The best coal product, with a calorific value of 30 MJ/kg, was obtained by hydrothermal upgrading: 91% of the combustibles present in the feedstock were concentrated in 34% of the original weight. Moreover, an amount of liquid products was generated in a yield of up to 10 wt% on dry intake. Via a Fleissner treatment ca. 70% of the inherent moisture was removed as a liquid, leaving a product whose calorific value is expected to be almost 20 MJ/kg. Via carbonization smokeless fuels can be produced with a heating value of ca. 28 MJ/kg and yields of 50–60%, depending on the temperature. From this particular browncoal, most of the silica fraction of the mineral matter was extracted by rinsing with water, thus reducing the ash content by 50% and the ash fusion temperature by almost 200°C. By combined thermal upgrading and washing, most of the contaminants, i.e., sodium and chlorine, and half of the amount of oxygen and sulphur were removed. On the basis of experiments with micro-gasification test equipment, Wakefield browncoal and its upgraded product seem attractive feedstocks for gasification from a reactivity point of view. The lowering of the ash fusion temperature as observed in washed products is important for the reduction of the reactor outlet temperature when gasifying under slagging conditions, which has a favourable effect on the thermal efficiency.
