You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nonlinear vibration analysis of composite and functionally graded material shell structures: A literature review from 2013 to 2023 Owing to the improved mechanical properties of composites and functionally graded materials (FGMs), their applications have been realised in various engineering domains, such as aerospace, marine, automobile, and defence. Materials’ property plays a crucial role in dictating the dynamics of shell structure. Although much research has been conducted in structural dynamics, researchers are still working to develop new theories for structure and materials for composite shell structures to investigate their dynamic behaviour with various computational approaches involving different shell theories and experimental techniques. Apart from the linear analysis, researchers have also focused on the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the shell structure with various shell theories. But still, this field of research remains vibrant for many researchers. This review encapsulates some critical articles in the field of the dynamics of both composite and FGM shell structures involving nanocomposite, viscoelastic and hyperelastic material systems. The motive of the study is also to highlight the analyses of the shear deformation theories employed for the development of formulations of shell structures, including geometrical and material nonlinearity, for the analysis of the dynamics involved in closed shells, panels, and such structures under fluid-structure interaction.
