Nonlinear vibration analysis of composite and functionally graded material shell structures: A literature review from 2013 to 2023 Owing to the improved mechanical properties of composites and functionally graded materials (FGMs), their applications have been realised in various engineering domains, such as aerospace, marine, automobile, and defence. Materials’ property plays a crucial role in dictating the dynamics of shell structure. Although much research has been conducted in structural dynamics, researchers are still working to develop new theories for structure and materials for composite shell structures to investigate their dynamic behaviour with various computational approaches involving different shell theories and experimental techniques. Apart from the linear analysis, researchers have also focused on the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the shell structure with various shell theories. But still, this field of research remains vibrant for many researchers. This review encapsulates some critical articles in the field of the dynamics of both composite and FGM shell structures involving nanocomposite, viscoelastic and hyperelastic material systems. The motive of the study is also to highlight the analyses of the shear deformation theories employed for the development of formulations of shell structures, including geometrical and material nonlinearity, for the analysis of the dynamics involved in closed shells, panels, and such structures under fluid-structure interaction.
