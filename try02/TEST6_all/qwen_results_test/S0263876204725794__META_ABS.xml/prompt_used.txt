You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gas Mixing in Circulating Fluidized Beds with Secondary Air Injection This paper presents the results of a gas mixing study carried out in a laboratory scale (I.D. = 0.23 m, height = 7.6 m) circulating fluidized bed with secondary air (SA) injection. Steady-state tracer gas experiments were performed to investigate the effects of SA injector design on radial gas dispersion under varying operating conditions (U o = 3, 5ms−1; 0<Gs<25 kgm−2 s−1) with silica sand particles (p s = 2650 kgm−3, d p = 250 μm). Three different types of SA injectors that could feed the SA to the riser at different orientations were tested in the experiments; tangential, radial and mixed. Axial pressure measurements show that the tangential SA injector considerably increases the solids hold-up in the riser compared with non-SA operation at the same superficial gas velocity and solids circulation rate. Tracer gas measurements and calculated dispersion coefficients indicate that SA injection significantly increases the radial gas dispersion regardless of the design of the injector. The most effective injector in improving gas mixing was found to be the radial injector. This is attributed to the large-scale fluctuations caused by impinging radial SA jets. Furthermore, the mixing pattern of SA with rising gas–solid flow shows considerable differences with different injector types.
