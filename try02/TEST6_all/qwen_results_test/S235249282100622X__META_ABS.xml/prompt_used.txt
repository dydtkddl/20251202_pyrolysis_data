You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal, dynamic-mechanical and electrical properties of UV-LED curable coatings containing porcupine-like carbon structures In this work, multi-functional coatings based on a UV-LED curable epoxy-acrylate resin and different loadings (namely, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 wt%) of carbonaceous structures having a peculiar porcupine (PuP)-like morphology were formulated and thoroughly characterized through thermal, dynamic-mechanical and electrical analyses. More specifically, biochar-based particles derived from cellulose nanocrystals were modified through the growth of carbon nanofibers onto their outer surface, aiming at combining the effects of globular and high aspect ratio structures in a single filler. The preliminary characterization of the carbonaceous structures documented the achievement of a highly carbonized material involving spherical biochar particles having an average diameter ranging from 15 to 20 µm, covered by fibers displaying length up to 100 µm. As assessed by dynamic-mechanical characterization, the UV-LED cured composite films showed a progressive increase of the storage modulus values as a function of the amount of embedded PuP structures, indicating a strong level of interfacial interactions between the polymer network and the particles. Furthermore, the introduction of increasing amounts of PuPs induced a progressive increase of the material thermal conductivity (from 0.109 W/mK for unfilled cured resin, up to 0.161 W/mK, for the composite film containing 10 wt% of filler) and a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity (up to (3.1 ± 0.2)*10−2 S/m, for the composite film containing 10 wt% of filler), thus pointing out the effectiveness of the proposed approach of surface modifying biochar particles in obtaining composite coating films with superior properties.
