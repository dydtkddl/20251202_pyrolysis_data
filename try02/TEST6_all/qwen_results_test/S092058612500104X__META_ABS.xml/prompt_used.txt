You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sn-silica catalyzes cheese whey to lactic acid in a fluidized bed reactor Worldwide, the dairy industry produces 200 million tons per year of whey. Among the most abundant components of cheese whey is lactose, a low-priced raw material for nutraceuticals, animal feed, and high value products such as lactic acid (LA)., a specialty chemical platform in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and in the food industry, and is the precursor to polylactic acid, a biodegradable polymer. Here, we propose a fluidized bed process that atomizes an aqueous lactose solution directly into a catalytic bed operating at 325∘C to produce LA. We synthesized silica supported Sn catalysts by varying the metal loading (from 0 to 0.1 g g−1 of Sn) and analyzed its physicochemical properties. This research highlights the critical role of Sn as an active site to hydrolyse/isomerize/retro-aldol/dehydrate/crack lactose to lactic acid in a gas phase environment. All catalysts achieved complete conversion. SiO2 impregnated with 0.1 g g−1 Sn catalyst achieved the maximum lactic acid yield of 23 % at 2 h of the reaction. Lactic acid yield declined thereafter due to coke blocking the active catalytic sites. XPS, Raman and CHN analysis highlighted changes in carbon distribution and evidence of coke accumulation in the spent catalyst. This article brings new findings related to significant challenges related to the continuous operation of a fluidized bed reactor in the conversion of lactose and strategies to mitigate agglomeration and coke formation.
