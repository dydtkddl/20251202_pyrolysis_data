Ultrahigh-surface-area phenothiazine-derived nanocarbon for adsorptive removal of iodine and pharmaceutical pollutants This study investigated the adsorption capacity of PTZ-C nanocarbon, synthesised from phenothiazine oligomers via conventional oxidative polymerization followed by direct pyrolysis. PTZ-C was thoroughly characterized to assess its structural, morphological, and surface properties. PTZ-C exhibited an average particle size of 128.4 nm, a remarkably high specific surface area of 3041 m2/g, and uniform pore sizes of 1.89 nm, making it well-suited for adsorbing environmental contaminants, including pharmaceutical drugs and iodine. The adsorption performance was evaluated using acidic and alkaline pharmaceutical compounds, specifically diclofenac (DIC) and caffeine (CFN) in wastewater. Kinetic analysis revealed that the adsorption of DIC and CFN onto PTZ-C followed a pseudo-second-order model. Equilibrium data obeyed Langmuir isotherm, with maximum adsorption capacities of 588.2 mg/g for DIC and 333.3 mg/g for CFN. Competing ions in tap water slightly decreased the adsorption efficiency by less than 3 %, simulating the improper disposal of pharmaceuticals. The regeneration potential of PTZ-C was evaluated over five cycles, with removal efficiencies decreasing to 76.5 % for DIC and 97.2 % for CFN. Additionally, PTZ-C exhibited exceptional iodine adsorption capacities of 6.322 g/g in the vapour phase at 75 °C, 5.930 g/g at 25 °C, and 2.473 g/g in aqueous media. It retained iodine vapour for up to seven days with minimal loss. PTZ-C also demonstrated stable adsorption performance over five regeneration cycles in both vapour and aqueous phases. Overall, PTZ-C derived from a phenothiazine-based polymer proved to be a highly effective sorbent for removing various pollutants, demonstrating high adsorption capacity, stability, and reusability.
