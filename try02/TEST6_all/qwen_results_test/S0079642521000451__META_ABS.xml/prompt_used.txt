You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nucleation and growth in solution synthesis of nanostructures – From fundamentals to advanced applications Nucleation and growth are two important and entwined processes in materials synthesis and engineering. While understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the processes remain challenging, there is a growing demand for much improved control over and modification of nanostructures with precise geometrical and chemical features, well-tailored surface properties and functional attributes. To this end, we first examine the key concepts of the classical and non-classical theories and then emphasise mechanistic studies of nucleation and growth. Particularly, the state-of-the-art imaging, signal and/or data acquisition techniques are discussed, including in-situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, microfluidic platforms and machine learning. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results with high temporal and spatial resolutions provide further insights into these nanofabrication processes for representative systems, such as Au nanoparticles and CaCO3, and subsequently guide the rational design and production of materials with desirable properties. Based on current knowledge, strategies of leveraging external fields to manipulate the nucleation and growth processes are presented. Several case studies in important technological scenarios are discussed to inspire further attempts for precisely engineered solutions. Finally, further understanding of the processes are highlighted along with potential applications and future perspectives of controlling solution-synthesized nanostructures.
