You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Artisanal and controlled pyrolysis-based biochars differ in biochemical composition, thermal recalcitrance, and biodegradability in soil Biochar composition and stability is under intense research. Yet the question remains to what extent the current state-of-the-art applies to artisanally charred biomass in tropical regions. We compared kiln and drum based biochars with their counterpart controlled (at 400 °C) slow pyrolysis biochars from coconut shells, rice husks and Palmyra nutshell for their biochemical composition, thermal stability and biodegradability in soil. Thermal behavior of individual organic constituents was quantified by pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS). Comparison of the mass spectra demonstrated higher abundances of either phenols, lignin and carbohydrate monomers or of lipids in the artisanally produced biochars. Hence, relatively more untransformed plant matter was preserved by artisanal charring and also the thermal stability of carbohydrates, alkylaromatics and N-containing compounds was lower for all three feedstocks. This indicates lower prevailing temperatures compared to controlled pyrolysis biochar, at least in parts of the biomass charring in the kilns or drum. Nine-weeks biochar derived C mineralization upon soil incorporation revealed a relatively lower biological stability of the controlled pyrolysis biochars. The proportion of detected ion intensity from thermolabile lower mass signals (<400 °C, m/z < 250) was negatively correlated to the net-biochar derived C mineralization. We hypothesize this fraction to be composite and act both as a C-substrate and at the same time to hold unidentified substances inhibiting microbial activity. Compared to controlled pyrolysis biochar, traditionally charred biomass, i.e. the ‘biochar’ most likely to be actually applied to soil in developing countries, has a heterogeneous thermal and biochemical composition and unpredictable biological stability.
