You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite wastes in concrete: A critical review and cost benefit analysis The application of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites has increased substantially in recent years as a result of need for lighter and stronger materials. Currently, the reuse and/or recycling of composite wastes is very limited while most of wastes are disposed of in landfill or incinerated. Recently, mechanical recycling, fluidised bed, and pyrolysis has been developed to recycle FRP composites, but yet to be fully commercialised. As an alternative recycling strategy, incorporating glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) into concrete has shown a great potential from both economic and environmental perspectives. This paper systematically reviews the performance of recycling of GFRP wastes into concrete with respect to fresh properties, mechanical properties, durability, environmental and financial aspects. Results show that the effect of recycled glass fibre reinforced polymer (rGFRP) on concrete mechanical strength is associated with the content of waste material (fibre or resin rich) and physical properties (shape, density, hydrophilicity) of GFRP recyclates, as well as the amount of recyclates. For rGFRP powder, the filler effect combined with the pozzolanic reaction can improve interfacial transition zone strength, increasing mechanical strength. Recycled glass fibre has reinforcing effect to restraint cracks and can provide extra slip resistance to strengthen the bond, resulting in improvement of flexural strength. Recycling of GFRP waste in concrete reduces water absorption of the concrete, improving durability properties. Furthermore, this research presents outcomes of cost-benefit analysis and benefit-cost ratio on five common GFRP recycling methods. The results show that repurposing rGFRP in concrete can reduce the total required investment and increase net profit. Recommendations and future perspectives are also provided to allow a wider adoption of rGFRP repurposing from industrial waste and the development of a more sustainable life cycle.
