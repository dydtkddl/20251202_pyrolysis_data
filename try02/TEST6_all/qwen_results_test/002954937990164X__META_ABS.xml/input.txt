Coal gasification with heat from high temperature reactors Objectives and status of the project “Prototype Plant for Nuclear Process Heat (PNP)” It is by now fairly widely known that the high temperature reactor (HTR) is a unique nuclear energy source which can supply heat at temperatures up to 1000°C for application in chemical processes, for which previously exclusively combustion heat sources have been used. With the HTR, it is possible to apply nuclear energy not only for electrical power production but also for the synthesis of liquid or gaseous energy carriers. Nuclear coal gasification appears most promising as the first step for the demonstration and industrial application of nuclear process heat technology in the Federal Republic of Germany. Reactor manufacturers and coal mining companies in co-operation with the Nuclear Research Center at Jülich established a joint project in 1975 for the development of an HTR with a coolant outlet temperature of 950°C, for the development and testing of nuclear coal gasification, for the detailed engineering of a prototype plant consisting of an HTR and gasification plant and finally for the construction and operation of this prototype plant for nuclear process heat (PNP). This contribution describes the status of the PNP-Project and the scope for future development.
