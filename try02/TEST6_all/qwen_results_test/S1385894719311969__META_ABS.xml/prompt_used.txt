You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-energy ball milling enhancing the reactivity of microscale zero-valent aluminum toward the activation of persulfate and the degradation of trichloroethylene Microscale zero-valent aluminum (mZVAl), an excellent electron donor, presents great potential in the field of water treatment. However, surface inherent oxide film impedes its development and application. High-energy ball milling is a promising approach to enhance the reactivity of mZVAl. In this study, taking nontoxic and biodegradable stearic acid (SA) as the process control agent (PCA), ball milled mZVAl (termed as mZVAlbm) was prepared and employed to activate persulfate (PS) for the degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE). Firstly, the role of ball milling on the surface morphology, structure and reactivity of mZVAl was revealed by SEM, BET, XRD, XPS characterizations and H2 evolution experiments. The results demonstrated that high-energy ball milling, as a severe plastic deformation method, can partially break the native oxide film on mZVAl surface and expose fresh surfaces, thereby appreciably increasing its reactivity. Secondly, the underlying mechanisms of mZVAlbm excelling pristine mZVAl in activating PS were evaluated through TCE degradation process. In mZVAlbm/PS system, complete degradation and dechlorination of TCE were achieved and corresponding rate (k obs,TCE) increased by 96 times, while traces of TCE were removed in pristine mZVAl/PS system due to the hindrance of surface oxide film. Additionally, sulfate radical (SO4 −) and hydroxyl radical (OH) were identified as the predominant active species. Finally, mZVAlbm surface corrosion mechanism in the presence of PS was also deeply clarified. After reaction, the corrosion products, namely Al-(hydr)oxide, precipitated on mZVAlbm surface, decreasing its reactivity, but ball milling again can easily regenerate mZVAlbm. In a word, high-energy ball milling as a pretreatment method can remarkably enhance the reactivity of mZVAl toward PS activation, achieving the rapid and efficient removal of contaminants from water.
