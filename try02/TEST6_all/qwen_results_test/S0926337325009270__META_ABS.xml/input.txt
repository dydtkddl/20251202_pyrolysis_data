Plasma catalytic hydrogenolysis of polyethylene to gasoline-range fuels over Sm/USY catalysts Plasma catalysis, as a highly promising technology for plastic upcycling, enables the efficient conversion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into oil fuels under mild conditions. For the plasma-catalytic LDPE hydrogenolysis process at an input power of ca. 56 W without external heating, the optimized 5Sm/USY catalyst exhibited the highest yield of oil fuels (83 %), with C4-C13 gasoline-range fractions accounting for up to 98 %. Compared to pure plasma condition, the incorporation of catalyst improved the discharge power and the discharge mode was transformed to surface discharge, which promoted the LDPE conversion. Notably, the plasma-catalytic system exhibited a 1.51-fold increase in C-C bond cleavage rate compared to thermal catalysis, with energy consumption being less than one-fifth of thermal catalytic processes, demonstrating its superior bond-breaking efficiency and energy-saving advantage. Mechanistic studies revealed that the plasma effectively activates LDPE molecular chains, synergizing with the shape-selective effect of porous USY zeolite. The addition of Sm2O3 species increased the content of Lewis acid sites and further promoted hydrogen ion abstraction to form carbocations. This method demonstrated excellent performance in converting other polyolefin wastes and real plastic wastes, particularly achieving 88 % liquid yield from real plastics, fully confirming the exceptional performance of the 5Sm/USY catalyst in plasma-assisted plastic waste conversion.
