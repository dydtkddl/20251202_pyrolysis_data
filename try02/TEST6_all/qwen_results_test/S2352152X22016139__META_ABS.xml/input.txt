Potential of potassium and sodium-ion batteries as the future of energy storage: Recent progress in anodic materials The escalating challenges of pollution and global warming have driven research towards the creation of more sustainable energy-generating methods. However, for the successful integration of renewable energy sources into the electrical grid, the replacement of fossil-based energy generation with renewable energy sources would necessitate large-scale energy storage devices to collect the intermittent power output from renewable energy sources. Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have gained a lot of attention as viable alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their availability, low cost, stability, and sharing the same electrochemical properties as LIBs. However, the fundamental issue with SIBs is the insufficiency of viable anode materials. As a result, the purpose of this comprehensive literature review is to give in-depth research on hard carbon anode material generated from diverse biomass precursors and waste materials (like plastics derived from e-waste, water bottles, cups, etc.). Furthermore, difficulties related to these materials will be discussed, and solutions to improve their electrochemical performance is explored.
