Updates on high value products from cellulosic biorefinery The ever rising problems associated with petroleum derived fuels and chemicals have contributed to establish an alternative platform for generation of bio-based fuels and value added materials. In this point of view, cellulosic biorefinery has attracted considerable and growing attention to develop a vast variety of platform chemicals, biofuels and other biomaterials. Biofuels are gifted products from biorefinery that can be implemented globally to reduce the gasoline consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. Because of their abundant availability, different types of lignocellulosic raw materials can effectively be utilized to generate a wide range of value-added products in a cost effective manner. Future challenges exist is optimising the cost of biorefinery processing. To overcome the limitations of biorefinery, novel technologies should be integrated to produce more high quality platform chemicals and other biomaterials. This article provides an insight to the production of different value added products from cellulosic biorefinery including its commercial challenges and economic feasibility.
