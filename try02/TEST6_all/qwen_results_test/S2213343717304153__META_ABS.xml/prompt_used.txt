You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding lignin depolymerization to phenols via microwave-assisted solvolysis process In this study, microwave assisted degradation of lignin, a paper industry and biorefinery waste product, is investigated in presence of different organic solvents such as ethylene glycol (EG), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethyl formamide (DMF) at different temperatures (100–140°C) and treatment periods (20–80min). Experiments performed in batch microwave reactor revealed that, in all the solvents, a major reduction in weight average molecular weight (Mw) of lignin was observed in the time period of 20–40min. In a polar protic solvent with high loss tangent (EG), maximum reduction in Mw was observed at 120°C, while in polar aprotic solvents (DMSO and DMF), Mw decreased with increase in temperature. Significant yield of phenolics (20wt.%) containing acetosyringone, guaiacol, syringaldehyde, anisole and lignin dimers (m/z 306, 322Da) was obtained at 100°C in DMF and DMSO, while at 140°C, 11wt.% phenolics were obtained in EG. Plausible reactions for the formation of phenolic monomers and dimers include etheric Cβ O and Cα Cβ bond cleavages induced by solvent interactions. The shift of molecular weight distribution to higher molecular weights suggested the involvement of recombination reactions at long treatment periods. This study shows that solvent-assisted microwave processing is a promising technique to convert lignin to phenols.
