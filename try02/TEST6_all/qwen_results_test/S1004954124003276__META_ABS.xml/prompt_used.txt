You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical investigation of turbulent mass transfer processes in turbulent fluidized bed by computational mass transfer Turbulent fluidized bed possesses a distinct advantage over bubbling fluidized bed in high solids contact efficiency and thus exerts great potential in applications to many industrial processes. Simulation for fluidization of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) particles and the catalytic reaction of ozone decomposition in turbulent fluidized bed is conducted using the Eulerian–Eulerian approach, where the recently developed two-equation turbulent (TET) model is introduced to describe the turbulent mass diffusion. The energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) drag model and the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) are adopted to describe gas–particles interaction and particle–particle interaction respectively. The TET model features the rigorous closure for the turbulent mass transfer equations and thus enables more reliable simulation. With this model, distributions of ozone concentration and gas–particles two-phase velocity as well as volume fraction are obtained and compared against experimental data. The average absolute relative deviation for the simulated ozone concentration is 9.67% which confirms the validity of the proposed model. Moreover, it is found that the transition velocity from bubbling fluidization to turbulent fluidization for FCC particles is about 0.5 m·s–1 which is consistent with experimental observation.
