Experimental studies on CO2-thermal plasma gasification of refused derived fuel feedstock for clean syngas production In the cycle of waste generation and management, the recovery of energy from solid wastes through highly efficient and low pollutant technology is a promising way. Hence, the current study focuses on clean syngas production via CO2-plasma gasification of a solid waste termed as refused derived fuel (RDF). The performance of feed rate, gas flow rate and plasma power on the syngas concentration, yield and cold gas efficiency (CGE) is studied. The high-quality syngas with H2 (42.6 vol%), CO (44.06 vol%) content possessing a lower heating value of 13.95 MJ/m3 is obtained with a cold gas efficiency (CGE) of 39.60 % by utilizing a maximal power of plasma torch (1.6 kW). However, with optimum process parameters, a higher CGE of 49.90 % is obtained. The obtained liquid oil with LHV of 30.59 MJ/kg could be used in boilers, diesel engines, etc., while the residue containing TiO2, CaAl4O7, MgCO3, etc. has healthcare, paints, cement industry, etc. applications upon further enrichment. The reaction mechanism of RDF to syngas and other products under plasma conditions is also proposed. Finally, an empirical correlation is developed to predict the composition of each component, calorific value and CGE of the syngas with the experimental results using SPSS software.
