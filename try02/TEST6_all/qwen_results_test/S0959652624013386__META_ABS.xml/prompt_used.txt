You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrating chemical and biological technologies in upcycling plastic waste to medium-chain α,ω-Diacid The growing accumulation of plastic waste poses a pressing environmental challenge. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, carry considerable health and ecological risks. In response, our study presents an innovative method to repurpose mixed plastic waste into valuable α,ω-diacids utilizing chemo-biological processes. We extracted pyrolysis oil, rich in hydrocarbons spanning a broad range of chain lengths (C7 to C32), from household plastic waste and employed a genetically engineered β-oxidation-blocked Candida tropicalis strain to convert this oil into α,ω-diacids of various chain lengths. Simple distillation at 200 °C enabled the extraction of medium-chain hydrocarbons from the pyrolysis oil. However, an increased ratio of medium-chain alkenes posed a toxicity challenge to the cells. Through hydrogenation, these medium-chain alkenes were fully converted to alkanes. Remarkably, cell growth was maintained even with an 8% concentration of hydrogenates. The subsequent biotransformation yielded medium-chain diacids, with 94.3% of the produced α,ω-diacids being of medium-chain length (C7 to C14). These results offer a novel and scalable solution for converting everyday plastic waste into valuable chemicals, thus significantly contributing to the circular economy and the advancement of sustainability goals.
