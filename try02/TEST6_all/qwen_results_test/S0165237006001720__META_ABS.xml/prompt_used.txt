You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of automobile shredder residues by means of pyrolysis Automobile shredder residues (ASR) are the rejection of the present processes of metal recovery of end-of-life vehicles. They are composed of several plastics, foams, glasses, rubbers, textiles, remaining metals, soils, etc., and have no clear recycling alternative. In the pyrolysis process (heating to moderate temperatures without oxygen), the organic volatile matter of the waste (plastics, rubber, etc.) is decomposed to gases and liquids, which can be useful as fuels and/or chemicals source. The inorganic components (fillers, metals, glasses, etc.) can be recovered and reused. Therefore, pyrolysis is especially appropriate for recycling complex wastes, such as ASR. In this paper an experimental study of pyrolysis of real ASR samples coming from an automotibile shredder plant (light and heavy ASR) have been studied. The pyrolysis experiments have been carried out in a non-stirred batch 3.5dm3 autoclave at 400, 500 and 700°C for 30min. The raw samples, as well as the solid, liquid and gaseous pyrolysis products have been thoroughly characterized. It is concluded that pyrolysis appears to be an appropriate technique for recycling the heavy ASR, since valuable solids (38–39%), liquids (20–29%) and gases (31–41%) are obtained, while this is not the case for the light ASR, which does not yield valuable products. Concerning temperature 500°C is enough to produce total decomposition of the ASR organic matter. Increasing temperature over 500°C increases gases to the detriment of liquids, but hardly varies the characteristics of the products.
