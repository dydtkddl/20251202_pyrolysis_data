You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent trends in hierarchical electrode materials in supercapacitor: Synthesis, electrochemical measurements, performance and their charge-storage mechanism Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that getting significant research interest among global researchers due to their features such as high specific capacitance, quick charge/discharge, high power density, prolonged cycle life, and safety that contribute to applications in portable electronic devices. Electrode materials are key constituents of supercapacitors and they control their electrochemical performances. There are various structures of electrode materials have been developed for supercapacitors such as core-shell structures, hetero-structures, and hierarchical structures. Among the structures, hierarchical electrode materials (HEMs) are low-cost, easy to synthesize, have high surface area, high active sites, and high electrochemical performances. Thus, this review focuses on the recent synthesis of hierarchical-type electrode materials, electrochemical setup, and characterization, analyses three- and two-electrode system performances in the use of supercapacitors, and charge-storage mechanisms, and summarizes critical viewpoints for future research. The performance of HEMs-based supercapacitors is shown to be high when compared to a single type of electrode. In supercapacitors, porous carbons, metal-organic frameworks, and transition metal sulfides-based HEMs have exceptional electrochemical capabilities across all parameters, including specific capacitance, cycle stability, energy density, and capacitance retention, as found in this review. This review may be helpful to the primary researchers who are working on the preparation and measurement of HEMs for supercapacitor applications. Further, the hierarchical structure-based electrode material is promising for future research in advanced supercapacitor research and could be of interest in technology transfer.
