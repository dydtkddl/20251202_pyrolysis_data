You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biocrude oil and hydrochar production and characterization obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae in methanol-water system Hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae under milder reaction conditions was studied for the production and characterization of high quality biocrude oil and hydrochar confirming its feasibility as sustainable biofuel source. The present study investigates the effects of solvents, temperature and time on the yield of biocrude oil. The comparatively higher yield of biocrude oil (47 wt%) obtained in methanol-water mass ratio of 0.75:0.25 also contained higher amount of ester components resulting in higher biocrude oil quality. Methanol-water co-solvent favored higher biocrude oil yield with lower nitrogen and oxygen contents as compared to pure water. Response surface methodology was applied to study the effects of temperature (222–322 °C), and reaction time (10–60min) at constant pressure of 11.5 MPa for methanol-water and biomass-solvent ratios of 0.75:0.25 and 1:5, respectively. The optimum yield of biocrude oil (57.8 wt%) and highest energy recovery (85.3%) was obtained with 75 wt% of methanol in water at 272 °C and reaction time of 35 min. Subcritical condition (temperature of 222 °C, pressure of 11.5 MPa) resulted in the highest hydrochar yield (19.5 wt%). Hydrochars were also characterized by CHNS, BET, FT-IR and TGA techniques to ascertain their prospective elemental composition, textural properties, functional groups as well as thermal stability.
