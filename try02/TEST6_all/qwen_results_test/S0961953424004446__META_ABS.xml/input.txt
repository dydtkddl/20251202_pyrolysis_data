Biorefinery approach for rhamnolipid production by metabolically engineered Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120 Most biorefinery processes based on lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) focus only on the utilization of sugars hydrolysate from the pre-treated biomass, thus underutilizing or not utilizing lignin. Although there is considerable focus on metabolic engineering for bioconversion of synthetic lignin-related aromatics, it has been far less on using depolymerized lignin as a substrate due to its complex nature. In this work, we demonstrate an integrated biorefinery approach to co-utilize all components of corncob biomass for bioconversion to rhamnolipids by using a metabolically engineered Pseudomonas taiwanensis VL120. Our results show that sequential processes of steam explosion, enzymatic hydrolysis, and base catalysis could result in sugar-rich and lignin-rich streams that can be used for rhamnolipid production. We first show that base-catalyzed depolymerization of lignin-rich fraction of corncob (leftover from the cellulose hydrolysis of pre-treated corncob LCB) results in 5.6 g/L of p-coumarate as the predominant monomer in the aromatic mixture. This was used as a substrate by P. taiwanensis VL120 to achieve 500 mg/L of rhamnolipid. In addition, the sugar-rich hydrolysate obtained from corncob with glucose and xylose as major sugars was used to produce 1.4 g/L rhamnolipids. Further, 650 mg/L rhamnolipid production was achieved from a substrate mixture containing the sugar-rich hydrolysate and p-coumarate-rich depolymerized lignin. This is the first report demonstrating rhamnolipid production in a single-pot fermentation by utilizing all three major monomers from hydrolyzed corncob biomass.
