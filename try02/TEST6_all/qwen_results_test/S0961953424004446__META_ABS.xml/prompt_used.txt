You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biorefinery approach for rhamnolipid production by metabolically engineered Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120 Most biorefinery processes based on lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) focus only on the utilization of sugars hydrolysate from the pre-treated biomass, thus underutilizing or not utilizing lignin. Although there is considerable focus on metabolic engineering for bioconversion of synthetic lignin-related aromatics, it has been far less on using depolymerized lignin as a substrate due to its complex nature. In this work, we demonstrate an integrated biorefinery approach to co-utilize all components of corncob biomass for bioconversion to rhamnolipids by using a metabolically engineered Pseudomonas taiwanensis VL120. Our results show that sequential processes of steam explosion, enzymatic hydrolysis, and base catalysis could result in sugar-rich and lignin-rich streams that can be used for rhamnolipid production. We first show that base-catalyzed depolymerization of lignin-rich fraction of corncob (leftover from the cellulose hydrolysis of pre-treated corncob LCB) results in 5.6 g/L of p-coumarate as the predominant monomer in the aromatic mixture. This was used as a substrate by P. taiwanensis VL120 to achieve 500 mg/L of rhamnolipid. In addition, the sugar-rich hydrolysate obtained from corncob with glucose and xylose as major sugars was used to produce 1.4 g/L rhamnolipids. Further, 650 mg/L rhamnolipid production was achieved from a substrate mixture containing the sugar-rich hydrolysate and p-coumarate-rich depolymerized lignin. This is the first report demonstrating rhamnolipid production in a single-pot fermentation by utilizing all three major monomers from hydrolyzed corncob biomass.
