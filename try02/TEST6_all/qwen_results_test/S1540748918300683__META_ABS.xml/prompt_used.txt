You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study of chlorobenzene pyrolysis The pyrolysis of chlorobenzene under dilute atmosphere and quasi-atmospheric pressure was studied at temperatures from 800 to 1150 K using a fused silica jet stirred reactor (JSR) and from 800 to 1250 K in an alumina tubular reactor. Chlorobenzene was chosen as a surrogate to model the thermal decomposition of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In the jet stirred reactor, a maximum chlorobenzene conversion of 48.5 % was observed at a residence time of 2 s, a temperature of 1150 K and an inlet mole fraction of chlorobenzene of 0.005. The following species were quantified: benzene (the major product), HCl, methane, ethylene, acetylene, biphenyl, 1-, 2- and 3-chlorobiphenyl, biphenylene and six isomers of dichlorobiphenyls. In the tubular reactor, a maximum chlorobenzene conversion of 95% was observed at a temperature of 1250 K under the same conditions as in the jet stirred reactor. The same reaction products were detected but with a larger formation of acetylene and methane and a smaller production of chlorinated and bicyclic compounds. The effect of two H-atom donors, methane and hydrogen, has been investigated in the JSR. Hydrogen addition has a strong inhibiting effect on the formation of chlorinated and bicyclic products. A new detailed kinetic model was developed and gave a good prediction of the global reactivity, the formation of most major products, and the effect of the addition of hydrogen and methane. Flow rate and sensitivity analyses have been made to explain the effect of H-atom donors.
