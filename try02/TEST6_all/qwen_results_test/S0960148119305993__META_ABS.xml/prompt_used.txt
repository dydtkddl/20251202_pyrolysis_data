You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic behavior and kinetic of wood sawdust at isothermal and non-isothermal conditions Pyrolytic behavior and kinetic of wood sawdust were studied at non-isothermal and isothermal conditions. The characteristic temperatures of ∼230 °C, ∼300 °C, ∼345 °C, ∼370 °C corresponded to degradation of pseudo hemicelluloses 1, hemicellulose 2, cellulose, lignin under non-isothermal condition, respectively. The release behaviors of gaseous products were closely related to the characteristic temperatures of weight loss. The tar generation could be characterized by CH3 group that was mainly dominated the by decompositions of hemicelluloses and cellulose. Under isothermal condition, the weight of derived biochar was described by a function of w char = 775.5–2.9T + 0.0037T 2-1.6 × 10−6 T 3. A novel nth-order discrete distributed activation energy model was developed to study the non-isothermal kinetic. The characteristic weight fractions of woody sawdust pyrolysis were found at conversions of 0.29, 0.30, 0.65, 0.84, 0.88 and 0.95. Parallel reaction model could explain the non-isothermal kinetic well with similar reaction orders to discrete distributed activation energy model. The isothermal kinetic of pyrolysis could be described by three or four components parallel reaction with nth-order Avrami-Erofeev model.
