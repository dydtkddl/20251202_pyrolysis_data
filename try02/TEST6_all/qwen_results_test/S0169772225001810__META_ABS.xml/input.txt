Electrochemical remediation of microplastics: Progress and prospects in water treatment Plastic pollution has emerged as a critical global concern, with microplastics (MPs)—defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm—posing serious threats to both environmental and human health. In 2019, global plastic production reached approximately 259 million tons, and is projected to rise to 500 million tons by 2025. By 2060, MPs are expected to account for a significant share of accumulated plastic waste, potentially reaching 1.2 billion tons. The pervasive occurrence of MPs has sparked growing concern over their potential adverse effects on both ecological systems and human well-being. MPs have been detected in a wide range of biological matrices, including placental blood and other bodily fluids of newborns. This alarming evidence raises urgent concerns regarding their potential impacts on total human health. This review article explores electrochemical treatment techniques—specifically electrocoagulation, electro-oxidation, and the electro-Fenton process—as promising strategies for the removal of MPs from water. Among these, electro-oxidation has demonstrated removal efficiencies as high as 90 %, with yields reaching 99.24 % under optimized operational conditions. The review concludes by highlighting key research gaps, advocating for further technological innovation, and underscoring the importance of raising public awareness to combat this growing environmental challenge effectively.
