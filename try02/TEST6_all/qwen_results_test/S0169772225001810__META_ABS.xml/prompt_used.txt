You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemical remediation of microplastics: Progress and prospects in water treatment Plastic pollution has emerged as a critical global concern, with microplastics (MPs)—defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm—posing serious threats to both environmental and human health. In 2019, global plastic production reached approximately 259 million tons, and is projected to rise to 500 million tons by 2025. By 2060, MPs are expected to account for a significant share of accumulated plastic waste, potentially reaching 1.2 billion tons. The pervasive occurrence of MPs has sparked growing concern over their potential adverse effects on both ecological systems and human well-being. MPs have been detected in a wide range of biological matrices, including placental blood and other bodily fluids of newborns. This alarming evidence raises urgent concerns regarding their potential impacts on total human health. This review article explores electrochemical treatment techniques—specifically electrocoagulation, electro-oxidation, and the electro-Fenton process—as promising strategies for the removal of MPs from water. Among these, electro-oxidation has demonstrated removal efficiencies as high as 90 %, with yields reaching 99.24 % under optimized operational conditions. The review concludes by highlighting key research gaps, advocating for further technological innovation, and underscoring the importance of raising public awareness to combat this growing environmental challenge effectively.
