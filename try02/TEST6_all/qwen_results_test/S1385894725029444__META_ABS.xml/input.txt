Initial products analysis and mechanistic insights into polystyrene pyrolysis via in-situ photoionization mass spectrometry Thermal pyrolysis offers a promising chemical recycling strategy for plastic waste, facilitating the transformation of polymers into valuable hydrocarbons with minimal pre-treatment and low operational costs. Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms and detailed characterization of initial pyrolysis products remain insufficiently explored. In this work, two advanced in-situ photoionization mass spectrometry techniques—Synchrotron Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoionization Mass Spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) and Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (APPI-HRMS)—were synergistically employed to comprehensively investigate the primary products and key intermediates of polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis under controlled conditions. Utilizing a SiC microreactor with short residence time of <1 ms, SVUV-PIMS identified 43 pyrolysis products, encompassing monomers, dimers, trimers, and some secondary aromatic hydrocarbons. Photoionization Efficiency (PIE) curve analysis further enabled the structural determination of 10 key intermediates. Concurrently, APPI-HRMS provided high-resolution mass spectrometric data over an extensive mass range (mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 50–600), uncovering additional secondary products such as naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and anthracene. Building upon these experimental findings, this study proposed detailed reaction mechanisms governing PS pyrolysis, delineating pathways for the formation of primary monomers, dimers, and secondary aromatic compounds. This integrated approach advances the understanding of PS pyrolysis, paving the way for the refinement of sustainable chemical recycling strategies.
