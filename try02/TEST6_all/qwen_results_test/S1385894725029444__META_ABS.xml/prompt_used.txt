You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Initial products analysis and mechanistic insights into polystyrene pyrolysis via in-situ photoionization mass spectrometry Thermal pyrolysis offers a promising chemical recycling strategy for plastic waste, facilitating the transformation of polymers into valuable hydrocarbons with minimal pre-treatment and low operational costs. Nevertheless, the intricate mechanisms and detailed characterization of initial pyrolysis products remain insufficiently explored. In this work, two advanced in-situ photoionization mass spectrometry techniques—Synchrotron Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoionization Mass Spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) and Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (APPI-HRMS)—were synergistically employed to comprehensively investigate the primary products and key intermediates of polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis under controlled conditions. Utilizing a SiC microreactor with short residence time of <1 ms, SVUV-PIMS identified 43 pyrolysis products, encompassing monomers, dimers, trimers, and some secondary aromatic hydrocarbons. Photoionization Efficiency (PIE) curve analysis further enabled the structural determination of 10 key intermediates. Concurrently, APPI-HRMS provided high-resolution mass spectrometric data over an extensive mass range (mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) = 50–600), uncovering additional secondary products such as naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and anthracene. Building upon these experimental findings, this study proposed detailed reaction mechanisms governing PS pyrolysis, delineating pathways for the formation of primary monomers, dimers, and secondary aromatic compounds. This integrated approach advances the understanding of PS pyrolysis, paving the way for the refinement of sustainable chemical recycling strategies.
