You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Value-added products from pyrolysis of hydrochar derived from polyvinyl chloride and alkali coal This work targets to produce multi value-added products by pyrolysis of hydrochars obtained from co-hydrothermal carbonization (co-HTC) of PVC and alkali coal. The hydrochars pyrolysis was carried out with a downdraft fixed bed reactor. The results indicate that HTC promoted the damage of oxygen functional groups, and the fixed carbon content and calorific value were considerably improved after co-HTC. The entire pyrolysis was delayed for coal hydrochar due to the increase of stable compositions in coal structure and improvement of coal rank. Besides, the PVC addition weakened this delay because of its instability, which could be verified by the activation energy. The H2 and CH4 yields increased in syngas, while the CO2 yield was concurrently reduced because of the removal of oxygen by decarboxylation. The obtained H2/CO ratio of syngas from hydrochar pyrolysis ranged from 1.34 to 4.33 depending on the pyrolysis parameters. The tar yield from hydrochar pyrolysis was lower than that of raw coal, which was ascribed to the lower degree of crosslinking in hydrochar facilitating the release of tar. The aromatic degree and rich pore structures of char indicated its great potential for contaminants adsorption which was further confirmed by the malachite green adsorption experiments. These findings could provide comprehensive knowledge on producing multi value-added products (hydrogen-rich syngas, poly-aromatic tar and adsorbent-char) from hydrochar pyrolysis, which would promote the economical utilization of high alkali coal and chlorinated wastes.
