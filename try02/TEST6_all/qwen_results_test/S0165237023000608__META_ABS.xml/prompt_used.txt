You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the pyrolysis of benzene via a novel ultra-high temperature pyrolysis photoionization mass spectrometry It is extremely challenging to explore pyrolysis reactions in-situ at high temperatures over 2000 K. Here we present a new method that integrates ultra-high temperature graphite tube pyrolysis (UT-GTP) chemical reactor with photoionization time of flight mass spectrometer (PI-TOFMS) along with pyrolysis chemistry. The ultra-high temperature pyrolysis photoionization time of flight mass spectrometer (UT-Py-PI-TOFMS) allows in-situ detection and identification of pyrolysis products at a maximum temperature of 2370 K with a mass resolving power of ∼ 4000 at m/z = 28, and a sensitivity of benzene is better than 64 ppb. This methodology is employed to reveal the pyrolysis mechanism of benzene at 5 kPa and temperature range between 1000 K and 2370 K. A series of pyrolysis products, including radicals, carbyne, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with high molecular weight are observed. Compared with previous work, we observed some unreported products such as carbyne (C8H2, C10H2), naphthalyne (C10H6), phenanthryne (C14H8) in the pyrolysis of benzene by UT-Py-PI-TOFMS. A plausible pyrolysis mechanism is presented based on the experimental data obtained by UT-Py-PI-TOFMS, and the results can be used for future research on accurately simulating the formation of PAHs. Furthermore, this results provide a practical analytical method for the study of ultra-high temperature pyrolysis reactions.
