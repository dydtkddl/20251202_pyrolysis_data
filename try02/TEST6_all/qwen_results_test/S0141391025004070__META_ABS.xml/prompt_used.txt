You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Revealing the pyrolysis mechanisms of cured epoxy resin in waste thermoset composites by using experiments and ReaxFF-MD simulation The disposal of waste epoxy resin-based composites is a significant global environmental challenge, with the decomposition of the epoxy resin matrix being the bottleneck. Pyrolysis is regarded as one of the most promising technologies for recycling these composites, while complex secondary reactions limit the yields of high-value pyrolysis products. In this study, the pyrolysis mechanisms of cured epoxy resin were investigated through the combination of thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR), rapid pyrolysis experiments, and reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations. The results revealed that the depolymerization of cured epoxy resin was initiated by the cleavage of CO bonds, leading to the formation of heavy pyrolysis oil. Secondary cleavage of CC bonds in heavy oil subsequently generated light oil, accompanied by the migration of oxygen atoms into the gas phase. Meanwhile, hydrogen radicals, methyl radicals, and hydroxyl groups were produced, promoting the formation of pyrolysis gas via intermolecular and intramolecular dehydrogenation, methyl hydrogenation, and the dissociation of CC-O or CC=O structures, respectively. Furthermore, aromatic-rich heavy pyrolysis oil containing crosslinked CN bonds underwent hydrogenation to generate cycloalkanes, initiating the formation of nascent carbon nuclei, which subsequently transformed into thermodynamically sTable 6-M rings through dehydrogenation and reorganization reactions, ultimately yielding pyrolysis char with an ordered and graphitized morphology. These findings provide theoretical insights for optimizing and advancing the pyrolysis recovery of waste thermoset composites.
