You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of Kraft lignin and corn cob agro-residue on the properties of injected-moulded biocomposites Lignocellulosic by-products are frequently disposed by means of combustion. This study investigates an alternative route for corn cob and Kraft lignin resources in order to support circular economy. The respective plant-based fibres and filler were compounded for the first time together with a poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix. Consecutively, seven different biocomposites were processed by injection-moulding and further characterized. The biocomposite containing a mixture of Kraft lignin and corn cob (12 wt% in total) exhibited the highest flexural strength (84 MPa). A proper wetting of PLA onto the corn cob particles demonstrated a good compatibility at matrix/fibre interface. PLA molecular structure changed in presence of 20 wt% lignin filler, with effect on the glass transition temperature and on the composite mechanical strength. The fibres moderately influenced composites surface tension, while Kraft lignin contributed to a slight increase of surface hydrophobicity. Surface energy (σsTotal) of composites have been estimated at 27.6, 28.7 and 27.8 mN/m for PLA/KL-20, PLA/CC-10 and PLA/KL-15/CC-5 respectively. While the polar component (σsPolar) have been estimated at 17.8, 20.0 and 18.7 mN/m for PLA/KL-20, PLA/CC-10 and PLA/KL-15/CC-5 respectively. Unlike the PLA/corn cob composite, those containing Kraft lignin were entirely biodegraded within 2 months in industrial composting conditions study. The materials could be utilized for end-use products thanks to their good mechanical and thermal properties. By adding wood-lignin and corn by-products, materials cost and carbon footprint shall decrease in comparison to pure PLA, while being a biodegradable and sustainable replacement of polyolefins.
