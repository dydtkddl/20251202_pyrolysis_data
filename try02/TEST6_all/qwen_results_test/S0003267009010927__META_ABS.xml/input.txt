Current technologies for analysis of biomass thermochemical processing: A review Pyrolysis and gasification are two of the more promising utilization methods for the conversion of biomass toward a clean fuel source. To truly understand and model these processes requires detailed knowledge ranging from structural information of raw biomass, elemental composition, gas-phase reaction kinetics and mechanisms, and product distributions (both desired and undesired). The various analytical methods of biomass pyrolysis/gasification processing are discussed, including reactor types, analytical tools, and recent examples in the areas of (a) compositional analysis, (b) structural analysis, (c) reaction mechanisms, and (d) kinetic studies on biomass thermochemical processing.
