You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of chlorinated heavy wax from pyrolysis of plastic wastes to low carbon-range fuels: Catalyst effect on properties of liquid products and dechlorination Catalytic conversion of useless chlorinated heavy wax (chlorine, 0.14 wt%) obtained from pyrolysis of refuse plastic fuel was studied using iron oxide impregnated HY zeolite to produce a useful liquid product. It was found that the largest liquid fraction (gasoline and kerosene/ diesel, 66.9 wt.%) with very low chlorine content was achieved when using Fe[3]/HY among impregnated HY catalysts. This demonstrated that the Fe impregnated HY catalyst had a dual function of catalytic cracking of HY zeolite and dechlorination of iron oxide. Excessive impregnation of Fe, i.e., Fe[20]/HY, showed the least cracking activity of heavy wax owing to the catalyst having lowest total acid sites, but yielded liquid product with the lowest chlorine content (60 ppm) among the tested catalysts. The spent catalysts were deposited by a significant amount of soft coke and chlorine, and they were totally restored by thermal treatment in air (700 ℃).
