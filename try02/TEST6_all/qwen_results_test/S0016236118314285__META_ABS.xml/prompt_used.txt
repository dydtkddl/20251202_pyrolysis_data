You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bitumen partial upgrading by mild hydroprocessing in a fixed-bed reactor Partial upgrading is an approach to processing Canadian oil sands bitumen with the objective to produce a synthetic crude oil that meets specifications for pipeline transportation (API Gravity of 19° and viscosity of 350 cSt at 7 °C). Most partial upgrading technologies under development rely predominantly on thermal conversion processes combined with additional steps such as solvent deasphalting. Owing to the chemistry of thermal conversion, the liquid product resulting from this route tends to be unstable and susceptible to potential operational issues in pipeline transportation and subsequent refining. Hydroprocessing represents another pathway for bitumen partial upgrading, with the advantage of being able to minimize product instability concerns and achieve the target product quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using mild hydroprocessing in a fixed-bed reactor for the partial upgrading of Canadian bitumen. Experiments were conducted in a pilot plant that underwent various modifications to handle raw bitumen. Systematic tests at different operating conditions were completed in a time period of 1394 catalyst hours without experiencing any plugging issues. It was demonstrated that stable and pipeline-ready product can be produced at residue conversions of 52.4 wt% or above and with a hydrogen consumption level of about 1005 scf/bbl. Future research must be directed at optimizing the process to reduce hydrogen consumption and investigating catalyst deactivation patterns.
