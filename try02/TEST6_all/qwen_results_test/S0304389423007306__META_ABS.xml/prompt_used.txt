You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The decomposition and emission factors of a wide range of PFAS in diverse, contaminated organic waste fractions undergoing dry pyrolysis Current treatment options for organic waste contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are generally limited to incineration, composting or landfilling, all resulting in emissions. Dry pyrolysis is a promising emerging alternative to these practices, but there is uncertainty related to the fate of PFAS during this process. The present work first developed a robust method for the determination of PFAS in complex matrices, such as sewage sludge and biochar. Then, a mass balance was established for 56 different PFAS during full-scale pyrolysis (2–10 kg biochar hr-1, 500–800 °C) of sewage sludges, food waste reject, garden waste and waste timber. PFAS were found in all wastes (56–3651 ng g-1), but pyrolysis resulted in a ≥ 96.9% removal. Residual PFAS (0.1–3.4 ng g-1) were detected in biochars obtained at temperatures up to 750 °C and were dominated by long chain PFAS. Emitted PFAS loads ranged from 0.01 to 3.1 mg tonne-1 of biochar produced and were dominated by short chain PFAS. Emissions made up < 3% of total PFAS-mass in the wastes. Remaining uncertainties are mainly related to the presence of thermal degradation products in flue gas and condensation oils.
