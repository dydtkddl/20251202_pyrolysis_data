You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hazardous waste dewatering and dry mass reduction through hydrophobic modification by a facile one-pot, alkali-assisted hydrothermal reaction Hazardous waste dewatering is important for volume reduction and further treatment. Hazardous organic wastes with low ratio of free to bound water, and low flash point are difficult to dewater and pose an explosion risk for conventional thermal drying. Here, we develop a facile one-pot, alkali-assisted hydrothermal treatment (AHT) method for cost-efficient hazardous waste dewatering, dry mass minimization and volume reduction. Wet paint sludge (WPS), a hazardous organic waste, was reduced (79% by total weight and 52% by dry mass) by dewatering through AHT hydrophobic modification, and the product was nonflammable. Conversion of bound water to free water enhanced WPS dissolution for further decomposition. Alkali was critical for boosting ether demethylation in the solid phase, and cleavage of ethers forming alcohols that facilitated transfer of solid mass into the liquid phase. Polar functional groups were eliminated through AHT, which increased the relative abundance of hydrophobic functional groups on the surface of solid residues and promoted dewatering. We also demonstrate that AHT can be widely adapted and scaled up to treat various hazardous organic waste streams, which is of significant industrial and environmental interest.
