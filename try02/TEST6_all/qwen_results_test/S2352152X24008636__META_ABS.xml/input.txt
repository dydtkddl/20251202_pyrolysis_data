A comprehensive assessment on bio-mass derived form-stabilized composite phase change materials for solar thermal energy storage systems Solar thermal energy systems (STES) with phase change materials (PCM) are preferable; nevertheless, PCMs' seepage effect and poor thermal conductivity limit their potential. Researchers examined the form stabilization and thermal characteristics of form stabilized PCM (FSPCM). Among the numerous supporting materials, biomass-derived 3D carbon structure is beneficial in the development of a novel FSPCM. To the best of our knowledge, a review on various bio-mass derived FSPCM (BFSPCM) and their impact on performance of STES has not been reported. This comprehensive study reviewed the related and recent literatures to assess the broad aspects of BFSPCM in sequence. This review emphasize that the carbonization temperature of 900 °C and the vacuum impregnation process are feasible in the synthesis of bio-mass based porous structured carbon and composite PCM, respectively. BFSPCM is not only advantageous in improving STES performance, but also for promoting better thermal regulation and comfort and waste heat recovery. Unlike former reviews, the limitations, consequences and comprehensive discussions are provided to outline their technical considerations. The summarized opportunities, challenges and future perspectives in this field would pave the way for them to be considered in developing a thermal efficient, eco-friendly, cost effective and more sustainable system.
