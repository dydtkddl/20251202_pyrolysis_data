You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive assessment on bio-mass derived form-stabilized composite phase change materials for solar thermal energy storage systems Solar thermal energy systems (STES) with phase change materials (PCM) are preferable; nevertheless, PCMs' seepage effect and poor thermal conductivity limit their potential. Researchers examined the form stabilization and thermal characteristics of form stabilized PCM (FSPCM). Among the numerous supporting materials, biomass-derived 3D carbon structure is beneficial in the development of a novel FSPCM. To the best of our knowledge, a review on various bio-mass derived FSPCM (BFSPCM) and their impact on performance of STES has not been reported. This comprehensive study reviewed the related and recent literatures to assess the broad aspects of BFSPCM in sequence. This review emphasize that the carbonization temperature of 900 °C and the vacuum impregnation process are feasible in the synthesis of bio-mass based porous structured carbon and composite PCM, respectively. BFSPCM is not only advantageous in improving STES performance, but also for promoting better thermal regulation and comfort and waste heat recovery. Unlike former reviews, the limitations, consequences and comprehensive discussions are provided to outline their technical considerations. The summarized opportunities, challenges and future perspectives in this field would pave the way for them to be considered in developing a thermal efficient, eco-friendly, cost effective and more sustainable system.
