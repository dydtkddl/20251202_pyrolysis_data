You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis methods, chemical structures and phase structures of linear polyurethanes. Properties and applications of linear polyurethanes in polyurethane elastomers, copolymers and ionomers Chemical and supermolecular structures occurring in linear polyurethanes were presented and they were referred to the analysis of the reactions connected with the step-growth polyaddition process of diisocyanates and polyols. Based on the general kinetic model of the step-growth polyaddition process, which is available in papers, inclusive of our own reports published on that subject, and based on experimental verification of that model by GPC chromatography and MALDI-ToF spectrometry, the influence was discussed of reactivity specifications of the diisocyanate and polyol monomers, and of intermediate products (urethane oligomers), on the size of molecules and on molecular weight distribution in linear polyurethane products. The applicability of such research methods as SAXS, SEM, AFM and DSC for the analysis of phase structures and micro-phase separation in the linear polyurethanes was presented. Also, the influence of phase separation on thermal and mechanical properties of the polyurethane products was addressed. Special attention was paid to the influence of polarity of polyurethane chemical structures, dispersion interactions, hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions on the value of free surface energy of polyurethane anionomers and cationomers. The effects on chemical and biological stability of those products were considered, too. Derived from the above analysis, the latest trends were provided for the applications of linear polyurethanes: as liquid crystalline materials, urethane–acrylic and polyurethane–siloxane copolymers in electronics, medicine and civil engineering, and as environmentally friendly elastomers in protective coatings produced from waterborne polyurethane dispersions.
