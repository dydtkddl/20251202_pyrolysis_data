Microplastic pollution in the Weser estuary and the German North Sea Microplastics (MP) are defined as synthetic organic pollutants sized 500 μm fraction was dominated by polyethylene. Estimated MP concentrations generally increased in the Turbidity Maximum Zone (TMZ) and decreased towards the open sea. This study contributes to the current research by providing novel insights into the MP pollution of the estuary and lower stretch of an important European river and provides implications for future MP monitoring measures.
