You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Probing the role of calcium carbonate on hydrothermal liquefaction of polyethylene in the presence of supercritical water This study investigated hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of polyethylene (PE) with different amounts (ranging from 1 wt% to 19 wt%) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The role and the fate of CaCO3 in HTL was elucidated under different reaction conditions (425–450 °C for 1–2 h). For PE, at 450 °C–2 h, the oil yield (76 % ± 0.9) obtained was higher than that from 425 °C–1.5 h (59 % ± 12). However, with higher reaction temperatures (450 °C) and longer reaction times (2 h), a higher gas yield (23 % ± 0.5) was also achieved. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis revealed that the oil product obtained with different amounts of CaCO3 exhibited a similar composition at 425 °C for 1.5 h and 2 h, mostly composed of paraffin and olefins with carbon numbers ranging from C7 to C17. At 450 °C–2 h, the oil product was predominantly aromatics for all PE samples with different amounts of CaCO3. Additionally, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis showed that over 90 % of Ca was distributed to the post-HTL aqueous products, indicating that HTL can simultaneously remove contaminants such as CaCO3 while chemically recycling PE waste into valuable products like fuels or aromatic chemicals. To understand the complex reactions during HTL of PE with varying amounts of CaCO3, the key reactions were investigated using quantum mechanical (QM) methods to elucidate possible reaction mechanisms involved.
