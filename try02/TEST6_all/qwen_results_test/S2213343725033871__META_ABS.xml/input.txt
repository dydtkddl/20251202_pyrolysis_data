NCM cathode recovery of spent lithium-ion batteries: A comprehensive review With the rapid advancement of electronics devices and electrical vehicles (EVs), Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become essential due to their high energy density, long life cycle and superior performance. However, their large-scale usage has led to substantial accumulation of spent batteries, posing serious environmental and resource-related concerns. These spent LIBs contain hazardous substances such as heavy metals and flammable electrolytes, and their improper disposal through landfill or incineration, can cause severe ecological harm. Efficient recycling is crucial not only to mitigate environmental risk but also to recover valuable metals like Li, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Al, helping to alleviate the pressure on critical raw material supply chains. This review presents a comprehensive summary of existing recycling technologies: pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, electrometallurgy and direct recycling, mainly focusing on NCM(LiNixCoyMnzO2) cathode type LIBs. Each technique has been evaluated in terms of metal recovery efficiency, energy consumption, scalability and environmental footprint. In addition, the status of current global and Indian recycling industries is discussed. Finally, the review outlines current challenges and highlights the need for advanced recycling technologies and innovative approaches such as green chemistry, direct generation and hybrid methods that are not only efficient and environmentally responsible but also economically practical to support the shift towards circular economy.
