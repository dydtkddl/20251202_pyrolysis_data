You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unlocking the Full Potential of Green Catalysis: a Novel Thermosensitive Catalytic System for Ultrasonic-microwave Liquefaction of Woody Biomass Efficient conversion of biomass into high value-added chemicals and fuels requires exploration of novel technologies of green catalysis. In this study, we have constructed a thermosensitive catalytic system using a dodecyl bispolyoxyethylene ammonium phosphotungstate ([AC1210]H2PW12O40) ionic liquid/1-octanol and applied it to the ultrasonic-microwave liquefaction of fir sawdust. To elucidate the liquefaction performance of the thermosensitive catalytic system, ultrasonic-microwave intensified effect and liquefaction mechanism, we have designed and conducted some experiments under various liquefaction conditions, and the resulting products were characterized by using advanced analytical instruments. Our results demonstrate that the quaternary ammonium phosphotungstate ionic liquid was found to have a high-temperature homogeneous and low-temperature phase separation properties in 1-octanol solvent. The thermosensitive catalytic system of [AC1210]H2PW12O40/1-octanol exhibited excellent liquefaction performance of woody biomass with ultrasonic-microwave assistance and good catalyst recyclability. At a liquid-solid ratio of 8:1, a catalyst concentration of 0.05 mol/L, and a mean sawdust particle size of 60–80 mesh, the liquefaction yield reached 64.79% and the recovery ratio of the ionic liquid is up to 98%. The ultrasonic-microwave assistance reduced liquefaction time from 60 min to 20 min and energy consumption from 0.507 kWh to 0.165 kWh, due to the heat and mass transfer intensified effect of ultrasonic-microwave assistance. Analysis of the liquefaction mechanism revealed that cellulose and hemicellulose in sawdust were transformed into carbohydrates, acids, and esters, while lignin converted into ester, ether, and other aromatic compounds. This thermosensitive catalytic system of [AC1210]H2PW12O40/1-octanol, as a green chemistry technology, exhibits a broad range of potential applications in biomass processing and conversion.
