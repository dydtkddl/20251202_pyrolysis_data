Unlocking the Full Potential of Green Catalysis: a Novel Thermosensitive Catalytic System for Ultrasonic-microwave Liquefaction of Woody Biomass Efficient conversion of biomass into high value-added chemicals and fuels requires exploration of novel technologies of green catalysis. In this study, we have constructed a thermosensitive catalytic system using a dodecyl bispolyoxyethylene ammonium phosphotungstate ([AC1210]H2PW12O40) ionic liquid/1-octanol and applied it to the ultrasonic-microwave liquefaction of fir sawdust. To elucidate the liquefaction performance of the thermosensitive catalytic system, ultrasonic-microwave intensified effect and liquefaction mechanism, we have designed and conducted some experiments under various liquefaction conditions, and the resulting products were characterized by using advanced analytical instruments. Our results demonstrate that the quaternary ammonium phosphotungstate ionic liquid was found to have a high-temperature homogeneous and low-temperature phase separation properties in 1-octanol solvent. The thermosensitive catalytic system of [AC1210]H2PW12O40/1-octanol exhibited excellent liquefaction performance of woody biomass with ultrasonic-microwave assistance and good catalyst recyclability. At a liquid-solid ratio of 8:1, a catalyst concentration of 0.05 mol/L, and a mean sawdust particle size of 60–80 mesh, the liquefaction yield reached 64.79% and the recovery ratio of the ionic liquid is up to 98%. The ultrasonic-microwave assistance reduced liquefaction time from 60 min to 20 min and energy consumption from 0.507 kWh to 0.165 kWh, due to the heat and mass transfer intensified effect of ultrasonic-microwave assistance. Analysis of the liquefaction mechanism revealed that cellulose and hemicellulose in sawdust were transformed into carbohydrates, acids, and esters, while lignin converted into ester, ether, and other aromatic compounds. This thermosensitive catalytic system of [AC1210]H2PW12O40/1-octanol, as a green chemistry technology, exhibits a broad range of potential applications in biomass processing and conversion.
