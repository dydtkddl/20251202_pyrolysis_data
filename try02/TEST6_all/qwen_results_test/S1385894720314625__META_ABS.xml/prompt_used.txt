You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultra-thin tubular graphitic carbon Nitride-Carbon Dot lateral heterostructures: One-Step synthesis and highly efficient catalytic hydrogen generation Lateral heterostructures (LHSs) consisting of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are generally nanosheets that are unfavourable to various applications, such as photocatalysis, because they are prone to agglomerate and against for multiple absorption and utilization of light. Herein, for the first time, we prepare ultra-thin tubular LHSs of graphitic carbon nitride and carbon dots (CN/C-Dots), with thickness of ~8.0 nm via a facile, one-step thermal polymerization of the supramolecular complexes composed of melamine, cyanuric acid and β-cyclodextrin (β-CyD) as starting monomers. Interestingly, the structural topology of the CN/C-Dots LHSs can be effectively modulated by the amount of β-CyD. The obtained tubular porous LHSs are nearly perfect nanotubes with wall thickness of about 8.0 nm, the smallest one reported so far, which not only greatly increases the accessibility of active sites and light harvesting via high light absorption and scattering, but also shortens the route of carriers migrating towards the surface and improves the mass transport. In comparison with CN, the optimized ultra-thin tubular porous CN/C-Dots100 LHSs exhibit significantly boosted visible light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (up to 113 times) of 24,760 μmol h−1 g−1 (λ > 420 nm), much higher than that over pure or nonmetal modified CN tubes reported to date. Moreover, the tubular porous CN/C-Dots100 LHSs are first demonstrated to be excellent electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxgen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials 415 and 340 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. These findings may provide insights into constructing highly efficient catalysts by tuning structural topology and heterojunction for different energy-related applications.
