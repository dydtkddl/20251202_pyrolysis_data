You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of waste plastics into fuels. LDPE conversion in FCC In order to study the tertiary recycling of waste polymers in standard FCC units low density polyethylene (LDPE) was dissolved into a commercial vacuum gas oil at 2 and 6wt.% and converted over two equilibrium FCC catalysts of the octane-barrel and resid types in a CREC Riser Simulator laboratory reactor. The reaction temperatures were 500, 525 and 550°C, the mass catalyst to oil relationship was 6.35 and the contact times were from 3 to 30s. The study included the effect of the concentration of LDPE over conversion, the various product (dry gas, LPG, gasoline, LCO and coke) yields and selectivities. Results were very similar for the two concentrations. At typical conversions of 70wt.%, dry gas and gasoline yields increased about 10wt.%, LPG yields between 9 and 13wt.%, LCO yields decreased more than 15wt.% and coke yields were lower than 7.7wt.% The RON index of gasoline was improved slightly (up to one point), mainly due to significant increases in olefin concentrations, while the fuel quality of the LCO cut was not affected. LDPE is easily converted and seems to be subjected to primary reactions of catalytic cracking, thus increasing the yields of olefins in the LPG and gasoline boiling ranges. It was concluded that recycling waste LDPE by co-processing it as part of conventional feeds to the FCC would not interfere with the standard operation.
