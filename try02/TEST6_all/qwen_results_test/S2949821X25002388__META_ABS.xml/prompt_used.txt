You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of biomass and plastics for next-generation fuel production and the effect of various operating parameters on it: A review The use of fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. At the same time, the finite reserves of crude oil, natural gas, and coal necessitate a shift to alternative energy sources. Apart from the typical non-conventional energy sources, waste-to-energy routes are gaining popularity. Non-biodegradable plastic waste, which possesses a high amount of energy, can be thermo-chemically treated (pyrolysis or gasification) to generate fuel. On the other hand, biomass (BM) thermochemical conversion has the potential to emerge as a green energy source with proper forest management. Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of plastic and BM show the potential for further improvement in fuel quality and quantity. The available research works involve a range of BM and plastic types, making it difficult to conclude a generalised trend of product generation. The current work systematically reviews the recent research data by categorising the results as per the type of feedstock used and the conversion processes. A general trend of fuel yield for various feedstock types and relative contents is summarised. The effects of various parameters – operating temperature, gasifying agent, blending ratio, reactor type, and use of catalysts are also discussed, along with an insight into the catalytic conversion mechanism. The review will be beneficial to get a broad picture of the recent progress in BM-plastic co-pyrolysis and co-gasification, associated challenges, and potential applications.
