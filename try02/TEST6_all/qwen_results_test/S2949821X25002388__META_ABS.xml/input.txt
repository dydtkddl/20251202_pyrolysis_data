Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of biomass and plastics for next-generation fuel production and the effect of various operating parameters on it: A review The use of fossil fuels leads to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. At the same time, the finite reserves of crude oil, natural gas, and coal necessitate a shift to alternative energy sources. Apart from the typical non-conventional energy sources, waste-to-energy routes are gaining popularity. Non-biodegradable plastic waste, which possesses a high amount of energy, can be thermo-chemically treated (pyrolysis or gasification) to generate fuel. On the other hand, biomass (BM) thermochemical conversion has the potential to emerge as a green energy source with proper forest management. Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification of plastic and BM show the potential for further improvement in fuel quality and quantity. The available research works involve a range of BM and plastic types, making it difficult to conclude a generalised trend of product generation. The current work systematically reviews the recent research data by categorising the results as per the type of feedstock used and the conversion processes. A general trend of fuel yield for various feedstock types and relative contents is summarised. The effects of various parameters – operating temperature, gasifying agent, blending ratio, reactor type, and use of catalysts are also discussed, along with an insight into the catalytic conversion mechanism. The review will be beneficial to get a broad picture of the recent progress in BM-plastic co-pyrolysis and co-gasification, associated challenges, and potential applications.
