Study on characteristics of co-pyrolysis of biomass and oil-based drill cuttings from shale gas development Co-pyrolysis of oil-based drill cuttings (ODCs) and biomass (palm fruits) were systematically investigated in this work. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was applied to study the pyrolysis characteristics of ODCs and biomass at different heating rates, different temperature ranges, and different mixing ratios. Differential thermogravimetry curves indicate that the co-pyrolysis produces a synergistic effect in 20°C–450°C and above 750°C. Fixed-bed pyrolysis was employed to determine the best pyrolysis parameters and analyze the co-pyrolysis mechanism: when the proportion of ODCs was 70%, the oil content of the pyrolysis residue was 21.71% lower than the calculated value; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis found that when the proportions of ODCs were 70% and 80%, co-pyrolysis could reduce harmful substances and increase favorable substances in liquid yields. Flynn–Wall–Ozawa method and Coats–Redfern integral method was employed to perform a dynamical analysis on TG curves over a temperature range of 20°C–350°C. Both results show that the co-pyrolysis of 5:5 mixtures can reduce pyrolysis activation energy.
