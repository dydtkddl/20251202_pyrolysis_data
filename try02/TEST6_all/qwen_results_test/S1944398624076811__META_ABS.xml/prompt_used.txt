You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on characteristics of co-pyrolysis of biomass and oil-based drill cuttings from shale gas development Co-pyrolysis of oil-based drill cuttings (ODCs) and biomass (palm fruits) were systematically investigated in this work. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was applied to study the pyrolysis characteristics of ODCs and biomass at different heating rates, different temperature ranges, and different mixing ratios. Differential thermogravimetry curves indicate that the co-pyrolysis produces a synergistic effect in 20°C–450°C and above 750°C. Fixed-bed pyrolysis was employed to determine the best pyrolysis parameters and analyze the co-pyrolysis mechanism: when the proportion of ODCs was 70%, the oil content of the pyrolysis residue was 21.71% lower than the calculated value; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis found that when the proportions of ODCs were 70% and 80%, co-pyrolysis could reduce harmful substances and increase favorable substances in liquid yields. Flynn–Wall–Ozawa method and Coats–Redfern integral method was employed to perform a dynamical analysis on TG curves over a temperature range of 20°C–350°C. Both results show that the co-pyrolysis of 5:5 mixtures can reduce pyrolysis activation energy.
