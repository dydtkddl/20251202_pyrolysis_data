Integrating life into material design for living materials 4.0: Navigating challenges and future trajectories from static to dynamic evolution With over two-thirds of research in the area of “Living materials” emerging in the past five years, it is essential to not only highlight the key insights and historical milestones but also to delve into long-term implications and future challenges. This review presents a visionary roadmap for unlocking the full potential of living materials by discussing the commercially available and historically existing living materials, as well as introducing a generational categorization akin to other technological advancements. Unique to this review is a comprehensive analysis of design, optimization, evaluation, and safety, covering biocompatibility, signaling dynamics, cell-matrix interactions, and adhesion across the spectrum of self-generated to artificially integrated matrices. Herein, the detailed status of recent developments in living materials in drug delivery, cell therapy, tissue scaffolding, biosensing, building materials, and environmental applications has been presented. Besides, this review highlights the need for advanced in-vitro/in-vivo models and regulatory considerations to mitigate the long-term consequences, ensuring reliable clinical translation, industrial adoption, and market acceptability. Finally, this review pioneers the introduction of living materials into five unexplored areas; optics, packaging, coatings, energy, and textiles, marking the systematic effort to expand the field beyond its current landscape through strategic identification of emerging opportunities.
