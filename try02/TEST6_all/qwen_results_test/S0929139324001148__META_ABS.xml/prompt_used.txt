You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Long-term restoration with organic amendments is clearer evidenced by soil organic matter composition than by changes in microbial taxonomy and functionality Here, a degraded soil, located in a semi-arid Mediterranean region, was characterized 17 years after organic amendment with sludge or compost (differing in their stabilization degree) for restoration purposes. To do this, (i) soil physicochemical properties and plant cover, (ii) soil organic matter (SOM) content and composition, (iii) soil basal respiration and enzymatic activities, and (iv) abundance, taxonomic composition, and functionality (shotgun metagenomics) of microbial communities were studied. Increased SOM and nutrient contents were found in soil from amended plots with respect to the control, with no differences between amendment types. This is explained by the lasting effects of organic amendments and the higher plant cover. Thermal and pyrolytic analyses showed that the restoration process enriched soil mainly with SOM of intermediate recalcitrance and of high chemical diversity. SOM composition did not differ between amendment types. Increased microbial abundances and activities were found in the amended plots, without differences between compost and sludge. Shotgun metagenomics showed that microbial communities changed in taxonomic and functional terms between amended and unamended plots, but these differences were rather limited. The taxonomic differences between treatments were mainly driven by increasing abundances of Actinobacteria and decreasing abundances of Proteobacteria in soil from amended plots. Soil microbial communities in amended plots showed some functional adaptation to the increased nutrient contents and predominant nutrients forms. This, together with the higher microbial abundances detected, explained the conspicuous soil enzymatic activities reported in amended plots. The effectiveness of the studied soil restoration process was confirmed here from an integrative perspective.
