You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Discernment of synergism in co-pyrolysis of HDPE and PP waste plastics for production of pyro-oil: Mechanistic investigation with economic analysis and health risk assessment Plastic waste is a major environmental challenge globally as it can hazard the soil, groundwater, marine, and land creatures. It also emits several toxic gases in open environment when heated up. The ceaseless demands for plastic materials due to wide applications generated a high volume of plastic waste which can impact sustainability development. The present study reports synergism in co-pyrolysis of mixed waste plastic for production of value-added products with economic analysis and health risk assessment. The characterization results of mass spectroscopy and NMR revealed that the product contains different types of hydrocarbons such as paraffins, aromatic, cyclic olefins, and lower hydrocarbons. The physicochemical characterization of pyro-oil showed similar fuel properties to that of commercial diesel (CD). Blending of pyro-oil obtained from HDPE:PP (20:80) improved the fuel quality that results in high brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and reduced brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). At the maximum load condition, ∼19.17% and 29.43% enhancement in BTE were observed with 10% and 20% PO blending, respectively. Also, ∼23.4% of fuel consumption was reduced when 20% PO blend was used with CD. The results showed that the maximum CO emission of 30.93% could be reduced by blending 10% PO. The engine performance and combustion characteristics revealed that PO blended fuels emit low percentage of CO, NOx, CO2, and HC – which essentially suggest a better life style by minimizing the health risks via reduction in greenhouse gas emission that may cause cardiovascular collapse, seizures, coma, and sometimes death. Thus, the present study will help in valorization and mitigation of generated waste plastics through energy conservation and boost the circular economy. The economic analysis based on the present investigation showed that ∼₹9.73 (0.12$) profit per litter can be achieved in the first year itself, while the profit in the 2nd and 5th year could be increased up to ₹54.43 (0.68$) and ₹67.73 (0.85$), respectively.
