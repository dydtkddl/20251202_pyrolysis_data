Recent development in ozone-based starch modification: From generation methods to film applications Starch holds significant potential in food industry applications; however, its practical utility is hindered by several limitations, including freeze-thaw instability, shear sensitivity, insolubility in organic solvents, high retrogradation, and the instability of its gels and pastes. Ozonation, an eco-friendly modification technique, effectively addresses these challenges by oxidizing starch molecules, introducing carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups, and partially cleaving glycosidic bonds. These structural modifications enhance the functional, mechanical, and barrier properties of starch, making it a promising material for biodegradable food packaging films. Additionally, ozone treatment improves key physicochemical properties such as gelatinization behavior, pasting characteristics, crystallinity, solubility, and viscosity. This review explores the application of gaseous and aqueous ozone in modifying various starch sources, including cassava, wheat, rice, corn, sago, and potato starches. Furthermore, it delineates different ozone generation methods, such as corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave ultraviolet (UV) systems. The impact of ozonation on starch structure, its functionalization for packaging films, and the challenges associated with scaling up industrial ozonation processes are critically discussed. Finally, this review provides recommendations for optimizing ozone-based starch modification and advancing innovative ozone generation technologies to enhance industrial feasibility and sustainable packaging solutions.
