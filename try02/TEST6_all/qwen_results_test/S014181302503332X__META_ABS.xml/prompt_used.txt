You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent development in ozone-based starch modification: From generation methods to film applications Starch holds significant potential in food industry applications; however, its practical utility is hindered by several limitations, including freeze-thaw instability, shear sensitivity, insolubility in organic solvents, high retrogradation, and the instability of its gels and pastes. Ozonation, an eco-friendly modification technique, effectively addresses these challenges by oxidizing starch molecules, introducing carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups, and partially cleaving glycosidic bonds. These structural modifications enhance the functional, mechanical, and barrier properties of starch, making it a promising material for biodegradable food packaging films. Additionally, ozone treatment improves key physicochemical properties such as gelatinization behavior, pasting characteristics, crystallinity, solubility, and viscosity. This review explores the application of gaseous and aqueous ozone in modifying various starch sources, including cassava, wheat, rice, corn, sago, and potato starches. Furthermore, it delineates different ozone generation methods, such as corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave ultraviolet (UV) systems. The impact of ozonation on starch structure, its functionalization for packaging films, and the challenges associated with scaling up industrial ozonation processes are critically discussed. Finally, this review provides recommendations for optimizing ozone-based starch modification and advancing innovative ozone generation technologies to enhance industrial feasibility and sustainable packaging solutions.
