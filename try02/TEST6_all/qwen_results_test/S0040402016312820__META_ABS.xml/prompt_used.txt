You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sonochemistry in non-conventional, green solvents or solvent-free reactions Few decades ago, the expertise gained from well-established extraction, processing and degradation techniques, paved the way for the use of ultrasounds as an alternative energy source in chemistry. Among other peculiar features, the locally extreme temperatures and pressures resulting from cavitation, proved to efficiently trigger reactions while maintaining mild average conditions, enhancing rates and yields and, hence, contributing to increase the popularity of sonochemistry up to the present level. The physical properties of the irradiated mixture are crucial for the effectiveness of cavitation, as well as for the proper transfer of acoustic energy to reactants. Therefore, the choice of a solvent that meets these requirements, while minimizing the environmental impact of the process is a fundamental one. Studies that combine sonochemistry with green, non-conventional solvents or with no solvents are surveyed in this review, evidencing how the most frequently investigated options are water phase, ionic liquids, followed by ethylene glycol and its oligomers, glycerol and few other biomass-based solvents. Numerous solvent-free, ultrasound-promoted procedures are also reported in the literature and are included in this contribution. The vast majority of the examples gathered here describe organic reactions, syntheses of nanosystems and polymerizations.
