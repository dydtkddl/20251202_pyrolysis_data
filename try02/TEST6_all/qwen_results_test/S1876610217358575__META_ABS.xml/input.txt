Catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse over cerium (rare earth) loaded HZSM-5 zeolite The main objective of the present work is to investigate the influence of catalyst to biomass ratio (C:B) on pyrolysis sugarcane bagasse over cerium loaded Hydrogen exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (HZSM-5, Si/Al = 23) catalyst via in-situ fixed bed reactor. HZSM-5 catalyst was used as a support with 1 wt.% of Ce as promoter loaded via incipient wetness impregnation method. The pyrolysis oil (PO) yield and coke yield were significantly affected by the use of Ce/HZSM-5 at various C:B ratio than the none catalytic pyrolysis, in which generating low PO yields (50.0 wt.%). The increasing Ce/HZSM-5 loading has an additional effect with respect to PO and coke yields. Among the tested C:B ratio, a catalyst to biomass ratio of 1:1 has demonstrated to be potential candidates in the catalytic pyrolysis of SB into a higher yield of condensable pyrolysis oil with lower coke contents.
