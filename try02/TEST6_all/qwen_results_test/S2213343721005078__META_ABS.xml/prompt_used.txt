You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Statistical modeling and mechanistic pathway for methylene blue dye removal by high surface area and mesoporous grass-based activated carbon using K2CO3 activator In this study, biomass of grass waste (GW) was utilized as sustainable precursor to produce highly porous activated carbon (GWAC) with mesoporosity using a K2CO3-assisted pyrolysis approach and tested for its methylene blue (MB) dye adsorption properties. The prepared GWAC was characterized using the various techniques of specific surface area (SSA), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer. The characterization results indicate the successful conversion of GW into mesoporous GWAC with high and desirable surface area of 1245.6 m2/g. The adsorptive performance of GWAC towards MB uptake was evaluated. To attain higher performance of the activated carbon for MB adsorption, the adsorption key parameters such as GWAC dosage (A: 0.04–0.06 g/L), pH (B: 4–10), temperature (C: 30–60 °C), and time (D: 5–15 min) were optimized using the Box–Behnken design (BBD) method. The adsorption equilibrium data were accurately described by the Langmuir model, where the adsorption capacity (q m; 364.2 mg/g) was recorded at the optimized process temperature of 45 °C. The present research also examined the mechanisms associated with the removal of MB using GWAC and observed the contribution of various MB-GWAC surface interactions (e.g., electrostatic, π-π, and H-bonding interactions). The present investigation shows the utility and effectiveness of GW biomass based activated carbon due to its favorable mesoporosity and cationic dye uptake in aqueous media.
