Experimental investigation of optimum bio-oil production parameters through co-pyrolysis of three organic wastes In Bangladesh, approximately 24,000 tonnes of general wastes are produced per day which creates environmental pollution due to lack of their proper disposal. Hence, a unique utilization of three types of wastes named rice husk (RH), scrap tire (ST) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been investigated using a fixed bed co-pyrolysis reactor for bio-oil extraction. Pyrolysis is selected because it produces more liquid (bio-oil) than other thermochemical treatments. The extracted bio-oil has been characterized by elemental analysis, calorific value, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography (GC-MS). During co-pyrolysis it is observed that higher process temperature produces more gaseous product and comparatively less char and liquid products (above 400 °C). In terms of a mixing ratio, higher percentage of LDPE produces more liquid and gaseous products on the contrary less amount of char product. The optimum operating conditions to produce maximum amount of bio-oil were 400 °C temperature for particle size of 1.18–2.36 mm, feed mixing ratio of 40:40:20 (ST/RH/LDPE), and running time of 120 min. The elemental analysis of the extracted bio-oil showed higher carbon and hydrogen content and lower oxygen content with a higher calorific value than that of the studied individual biomass-derived oil, leading to upgraded bio-oil. FTIR and GC-MS analysis clarifies the presence of mainly aliphatic compound in the co-pyrolytic oil. However, the number of aromatic compounds present in the co-pyrolytic oil is less than the individual biomass derived oil. The results indicated that the co-pyrolysis of ST, RH, and LDPE could be a promising way of organic waste material conversion into useful alternative fuel.
