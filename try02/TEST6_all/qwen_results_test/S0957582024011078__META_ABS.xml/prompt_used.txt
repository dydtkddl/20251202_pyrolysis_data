You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing the conversion of waste plastic into suitable engine fuel through response surface methodology The extensive utilization of plastic in daily life has significantly contributed to per-day waste generation. The conversion of waste plastic through pyrolysis into fossil fuel is a promising solution to waste management and energy crises. The precise control of the process parameters in the pyrolysis would be a sustainable business model. Since the optimization of process parameters for production yield and the physicochemical properties of waste plastic oil have been underexplored. So, the current research optimized input process parameters of pyrolysis through response surface methodology using a central composite design. The input parameters of the experimental design were reaction temperature (350°C-550°C), retention time (60–300 min), nitrogen flow rate (0–40 ml/s), and ZSM-5 catalyst concentration (1–5 wt%). Waste plastic is converted into the optimized yield of oil (85 %), solid (3 %), and syngas (12 %). Waste plastic oil (WPO) had optimal results of physicochemical properties like heating value (48 MJ/kg), flash point (60 °C), kinematic viscosity (2.1 mm2/s), and density (820 kg/m3). American Society for Testing and Materials Standards validated the produced WPO, which had better fuel properties than petroleum diesel. However, the application of other sustainable biocatalysts and uncondensed gas may be explored in future research.
