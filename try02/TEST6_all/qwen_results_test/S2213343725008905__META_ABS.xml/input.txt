Performance evaluation of existing and advanced processes for remediation of microplastics: A comprehensive review Microplastics (MPs) raise concerns due to their impacts on ecosystems and human health. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the nature, classification, sources, and distribution of MPs. It highlights the significant contribution of developed and developing countries to the release of MPs, influenced by plastic consumption patterns and waste management practices. Furthermore, the various sources of MPs, including industrial processes, synthetic fibers, personal care products, and agricultural activities, as well as their accumulation in wastewater treatment plants and the environment have been elaborated. The environmental fate and transport of MPs in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are discussed, emphasizing their potential to infiltrate the food chain and biological systems. The review also examines current and emerging remediation technologies for Microplastics, including advanced filtration, separation methods, and innovative approaches like advanced oxidation processes and biodegradation. The economic impact of MPs on healthcare, environmental clean-up, and tourism is also addressed. Finally, government policies and campaigns aimed at curbing microplastics/nanoplastics pollution are reviewed, alongside recommendations for preventing microplastic generation, improving treatment processes, and conducting life cycle assessments to mitigate their environmental footprint.
