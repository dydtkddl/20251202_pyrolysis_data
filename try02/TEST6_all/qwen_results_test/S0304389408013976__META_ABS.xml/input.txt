Pyrolysis conditions and ozone oxidation effects on ammonia adsorption in biomass generated chars Ammonia adsorbents were generated via pyrolysis of biomass (peanut hulls and palm oil shells) over a range of temperatures and compared to a commercially available activated carbon (AC) and solid biomass residuals (wood and poultry litter fly ash). Dynamic ammonia adsorption studies (i.e., breakthrough curves) were performed using these adsorbents at 23°C from 6 to 17ppmv NH3. Of the biomass chars, palm oil char generated at 500°C had the highest NH3 adsorption capacity (0.70mg/g, 6ppmv, 10% relative humidity (RH)), was similar to the AC, and contrasted to the other adsorbents (including the AC), the NH3 adsorption capacity significantly increased if the relative humidity was increased (4mg/g, 7ppmv, 73% RH). Room temperature ozone treatment of the chars and activated carbon significantly increased the NH3 adsorption capacity (10% RH); resultant adsorption capacity, q (mg/g) increased by ∼2, 6, and 10 times for palm oil char, peanut hull char (pyrolysis only), and activated carbon, respectively. However, water vapor (73% RH at 23°C) significantly reduced NH3 adsorption capacity in the steam and ozone treated biomass, yet had no effect on the palm shell char generated at 500°C. These results indicate the feasibility of using a low temperature (and thus low energy input) pyrolysis and activation process for the generation of NH3 adsorbents from biomass residuals.
