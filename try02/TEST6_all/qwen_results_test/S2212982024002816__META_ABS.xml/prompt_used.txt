You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Feedstock recycling of single-use garment simultaneously using CO2 and MSW incinerator bottom ash This study is aimed at proposing a feedstock recycling approach to make value-added monomer from single-use garment like stocking waste (SW) using incinerator bottom ash catalyst (IBAC). SW is made mainly of nylon 6 (>80 wt%) with minor components such as polyurethane. Thermochemical SW decomposition pathways are identified by evolved gas analysis and single-shot pyrolysis analysis, confirming that caprolactam (a value-added chemical re-used for manufacturing nylon 6) is the major product. IBAC is composed mainly of alkaline metal oxides (e.g., CaO). The use of IBAC in thermochemical SW conversion at 500 °C under CO2 atmosphere increases the yield of caprolactam reaching 70.8 wt% (20 % higher than non-catalytic SW conversion (59.2 wt%)). Moreover, the caprolactam yield corrected to the nylon 6 content of SW is 86.8 wt%. The enhancement of caprolactam production by IBAC in CO2 is most likely due to the synergistical effect of IBAC and CO2 on promoting the molecular interaction of amide groups present on SW. It is hoped that this study brings the idea of new applications of concurrently reusing textile waste (e.g., SW) and municipal solid waste-treatment byproduct (e.g., IBAC).
