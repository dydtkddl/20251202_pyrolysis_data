You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation, characterization, and selection of nano-assisted phase change materials for thermal management and storage applications The trend toward high-power-density, compact electronic devices demands effective heat control to preserve lifespan and performance. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) provide a lightweight, passive option because of their high latent heat, whereas active cooling techniques like fans can increase bulk and cost. High specific heat capacity, minimal volume change during phase transition, operating temperature, and melting point are all necessary when choosing a PCM. However, the restricted application scope of PCMs due to their low thermal conductivity is overcome by adding thermal conductivity enhancers, including nanomaterials. This paper studies the preparation, classification, and selection criteria of Nano-enhanced Phase Change Materials (NePCMs) utilizing methods such as the response surface approach and multi-criteria decision-making, based on two decades of research in this area. For an in-depth understanding of how nanoparticles impact PCMs' thermophysical properties, the paper discusses characterization methods like TEM, SEM, DSC, XRD, and IR spectroscopy. Integration of nanomaterials improves energy efficiency and minimizes environmental effects, integrating nano-enhanced PCM with sustainable development goals 13 (Climate Action) and 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). Nano-enhanced PCM provides an alternative to advanced thermal management solutions in electronics and thermal storage applications by addressing thermal performance issues.
