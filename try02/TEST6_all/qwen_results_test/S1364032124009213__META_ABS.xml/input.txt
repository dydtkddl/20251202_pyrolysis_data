Preparation, characterization, and selection of nano-assisted phase change materials for thermal management and storage applications The trend toward high-power-density, compact electronic devices demands effective heat control to preserve lifespan and performance. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) provide a lightweight, passive option because of their high latent heat, whereas active cooling techniques like fans can increase bulk and cost. High specific heat capacity, minimal volume change during phase transition, operating temperature, and melting point are all necessary when choosing a PCM. However, the restricted application scope of PCMs due to their low thermal conductivity is overcome by adding thermal conductivity enhancers, including nanomaterials. This paper studies the preparation, classification, and selection criteria of Nano-enhanced Phase Change Materials (NePCMs) utilizing methods such as the response surface approach and multi-criteria decision-making, based on two decades of research in this area. For an in-depth understanding of how nanoparticles impact PCMs' thermophysical properties, the paper discusses characterization methods like TEM, SEM, DSC, XRD, and IR spectroscopy. Integration of nanomaterials improves energy efficiency and minimizes environmental effects, integrating nano-enhanced PCM with sustainable development goals 13 (Climate Action) and 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). Nano-enhanced PCM provides an alternative to advanced thermal management solutions in electronics and thermal storage applications by addressing thermal performance issues.
