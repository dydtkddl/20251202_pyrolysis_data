You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coarse-grained CFD-DEM simulation and enhancement mechanism analysis of spouted fluidized bed biomass gasification reactor: effect of pulsed gas flow Spouted fluidized beds are widely used in biomass gasification process because of their high heat transfer efficiency, excellent mixing performance, and broad feedstock adaptability. However, the dead zone formed at the bottom of the reactor can significantly inhibit syngas yield. To mitigate these adverse effects, this study introduced pulsed gas flow to optimize the biomass gasification process through periodic disturbances, thereby improving the syngas yield. Firstly, this study employed CFD-DEM simulation method and innovatively incorporated a coarse-grained model to address the high computational resource demands of the traditional DEM, achieving a 176 % improvement in computational speed while ensuring its accuracy. Based on the proposed model, the frequency and amplitude parameters of pulsed gas flow on particle flux, heat transfer, and syngas molar fraction characteristics in the spouted fluidized bed biomass gasification reactor were analyzed and thus the optimal frequency and amplitude of pulsed gas flow were determined as 4 Hz and 0.8 m/s, respectively. Furthermore, this study investigated the effects of optimal pulsed gas flow on the gasification process at different biomass particle flow rates, sizes, and densities. Compared with continuous gas flow, pulsed gas flow increased syngas mass fraction by up to 15.6 % at different biomass densities. In contrast, the effects of the biomass particle flow rate and size on the syngas mass fraction were less significant. Finally, via the comparative analyses of the hydrodynamic characteristics, heat transfer, and reaction rates in the spouted fluidized bed reactor, an enhancement mechanism of pulsed gas flow on the biomass gasification process was proposed. This study offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the enhancement mechanism of pulsed gas flow on the biomass gasification process in spouted fluidized beds.
