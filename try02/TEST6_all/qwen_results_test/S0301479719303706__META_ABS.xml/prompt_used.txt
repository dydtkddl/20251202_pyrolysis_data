You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of waste plastics under non-sweeping atmosphere: Part 1: Effect of temperature, product optimization, and degradation mechanism Continuous generation of plastic waste has prompted substantial research efforts in its utilization as a feedstock for energy generation. Pyrolysis has emerged as one of the best waste management technique for energy extraction from the plastic waste. The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of operating temperature on the liquid product yields in the pyrolysis process by non-isothermal heating. Non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (PE) [high density polyethylene (HDPE)], waste polypropene (PP), waste polystyrene (PS), waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and mixed plastic waste (MPW) was carried out in a non-sweeping atmosphere in a semi-batch reactor at four different temperatures 450, 500, 550, and 600 °C. The minimum degradation temperature of the mixed and individual plastics was obtained using a thermogravimetric apparatus (TGA) at a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The TGA results show that all plastics degrade in a single step and the degradation temperatures of PS > PET > PP > HDPE, while mixed plastic degradation indicates two distinct degradation steps. Further, a waste polymer shows a lower degradation temperature than the virgin polymer. The degradation of HDPE is found to produce the maximum oil yield with minimum solid residue. The degradation of PET results in the highest amount of solid and benzoic acid as crystals and gas with no oil. Degradation of mixed plastic causes oil yield in the intermediate range of pyrolysis of individual plastic wastes. Overall, 500 °C is observed to be an optimum temperature for the recovery of low-density pyrolytic oil with the highest liquid yield. The degradation of PE and PP is found to be caused by random chain scission followed by inter and intramolecular hydrogen transfer. The degradation of PS occurs by side elimination or end chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The degradation of mix plastics results from random chain scission followed by β-scission mechanism. The effect of temperature on oil and gas recovery as well as recovery time was also assessed.
