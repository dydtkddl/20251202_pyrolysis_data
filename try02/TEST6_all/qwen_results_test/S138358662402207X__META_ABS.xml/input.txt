Adsorption efficiency and in-situ catalytic thermal degradation behaviour of microplastics from water over Fe-modified lignin-based magnetic biochar The efficient removal and degradation of microplastics are critical for protecting aquatic ecosystems. Herein, Fe-modified magnetic biochar (MBC) was synthesized as an adsorbent for removing microplastics in water. The effects of lignin/Fe salt mass ratios, adsorbent amount, adsorption time, adsorption temperature, solution pH, and presence of coexisting anions on adsorption efficiency were investigated. The thermal degradation behaviour and recycling characteristic of microplastics was also explored. Results showed that MBC has a developed pore structure, superparamagnetic property, and abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. The removal efficiency of polystyrene microplastics using MBC-11 was 99 %, with an adsorption capacity of 68.57 mg/g, which was 25 times higher than that of unmodified lignin biochar. The kinetics of the adsorption process followed the pseudo-first kinetic model, and the equilibrium data best fitted the Freundlich model. Thermodynamic results confirmed that adsorption over MBC was a spontaneous, heat-absorbing, and entropy-increasing process. The adsorption mechanism of PS by biochar was mainly via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and pore throttle. The thermal-degradation products of PS were mainly hydrocarbons, including styrene, benzene, and toluene, owing to the enhanced β-scission, H-shift, and methylation reactions at MBC catalytic sites. This study provides a scientific basis for the development of control technologies for microplastics removal in water.
