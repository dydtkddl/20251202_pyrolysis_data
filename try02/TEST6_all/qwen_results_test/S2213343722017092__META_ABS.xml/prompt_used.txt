You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regulation of Porosity in MOFs: A Review on Tunable Scaffolds and Related Effects and Advances in Different Applications Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a form of porous and crystalline material created by combining metal ions and organic linkers and received greater attention because of their distinctive structure and widespread uses in a variety of applications such as gas storage and separation, catalysis, enzyme immobilization, drug delivery, water capture, and sensing. Various well-designed MOF-based composites that combine MOFs with other feature materials such as nanoparticles, quantum dots, natural enzymes, or polymers with notably improved or unique capabilities have recently been described compared with single components. MOFs have been used as provision substrates for nanomaterials and sacrificial templates/precursors in the preparation of various functional nanostructures. The structural-functional relations and role of MOFs are crucial for understanding to synthesize high-performance MOF-based composites effectively and directionally for specific applications. The porosity of MOFs is regarded as one of their most promising properties, as it allows for space on the micro- and meso-scales, thus constraining and exposing their functionalities. MOF research has focused on designing MOFs with high porosity and increasing effective activation methods for conserving and gaining access to their pore space. The most recent advancement of MOFs as precursors for the synthesis of various nanostructures and their possible applications are investigated in this paper. The practical activities of MOFs are categorized and explored through several instances, which can help chemical users comprehend the structural/functional link in MOF-based composites from a new perception. Finally, a perspective on future problems and possible opportunities for high porosity MOFs in various applications is discussed.
