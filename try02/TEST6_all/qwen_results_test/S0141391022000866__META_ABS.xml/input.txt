Slow pyrolysis of waste polyethylene terephthalate yielding paraldehyde, ethylene glycol, benzoic acid and clean fuel The low-temperature slow pyrolysis of PET waste was studied. After intensive thermal activation, the waste PET could be completely pyrolyzed at 25 °C min−1 to the final temperature of 400 °C. The main components of the resulting oil were paraldehyde (54.7 wt.%) and ethylene glycol (23.7 wt.%); further, benzoic acid and benzoates were obtained. Such products represent valuable intermediates for industrial use or other applications. In addition, the pyrolysis produced a solid carbonaceous residue, particularly usable as a low-ash and low-sulfur smokeless fuel (HHV 31.3, LHV 30.4 MJ kg−1). Thus, the low-temperature pyrolysis of PET waste yields products that are easy to put to use with no demands on the purity of the feedstock.
