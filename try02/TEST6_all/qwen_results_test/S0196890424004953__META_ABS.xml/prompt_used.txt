You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of syngas through integrating carbon dioxide in the catalytic pyrolysis of plantation waste This study introduces the sustainable recovery of energy from plantation waste by converting rubber tree residue (RTR) into syngas through carbon dioxide (CO2)-assisted pyrolysis. The investigation centers on elucidating the specific impact of CO2 on the pyrolysis of rubber tree residue, emphasizing its significant influence on enhancing syngas production. At temperatures ≥ 500 °C, CO2 engages with volatile matters (VMs) released during the thermolysis of rubber tree residue, increasing carbon monoxide (CO) yields. To further optimize the process, catalytic pyrolysis setups incorporating additional heat (600 °C) and a nickel-based catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) were implemented. These experimental configurations substantially increased syngas production from 19.51 to 24.24 mmol g−1, particularly amplifying CO yields under CO2 conditions 2.58-fold compared to nitrogen (N2) conditions. This enhancement is attributed to the partial oxidation of volatile matters facilitated by CO2. Additionally, the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst played a pivotal role in expediting the gas-phase homogeneous reaction of CO2 with volatile matters, leading to further improved syngas production. Indeed, the syngas yield in the catalytic pyrolysis in the presence of CO2 was 24.24 mmol g−1, which increased by 1.24 times in reference to the result under the N2 environment. The identified functional role of CO2 presents an opportunity to enhance the sustainability of waste management by optimizing carbon utilization and generating value-added products.
