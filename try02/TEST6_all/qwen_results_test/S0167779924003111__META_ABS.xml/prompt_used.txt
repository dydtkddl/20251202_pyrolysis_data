You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Complex waste stream valorization through combined enzymatic hydrolysis and catabolic assimilation by Pseudomonas putida Biogenic waste-derived feedstocks for production of fuels, chemicals, and materials offer great potential supporting the transition to net-zero and greater circularity. However, such feedstocks are heterogeneous and subject to geographical and seasonal variability. Here, we show that, through careful strain selection and metabolic engineering, Pseudomonas putida can be employed to permit efficient co-utilization of highly heterogeneous substrate compositions derived from hydrolyzed mixed municipal-like waste fractions (food, plastic, organic, paper, cardboard, and textiles) for growth and synthesis of exemplar bioproducts. Design of experiments was employed to explore the combinatorial space of nine waste-derived monomers, displaying robust catabolic efficiency regardless of substrate composition. Prospective Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life-Cycle Costing (LCC) illustrated the climate change (CC) and economic advantages of biomanufacturing compared with conventional waste treatment options, demonstrating a 41–62% potential reduction in CC impact. This work demonstrates the potential for expanding treatment strategies for mixed waste to include engineered microbes.
