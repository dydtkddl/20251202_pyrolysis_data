You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimized process and modeling of waste Gmelina arborea seed pyrolytic oil production and its characterization as a sustainable biofuel Biofuels from bioresources are a viable renewable energy source, but high prices, the food versus fuel debate, and biodiversity loss limit the demands for bioenergy. Sourcing alternative bioresources from waste with a higher yield and energy value to produce bioenergy, as well as optimizing biofuel refining processes, are crucial for reducing production costs and increasing output to mitigate high prices and feedstock availability. The extracted bio-oil of non-edible seeds of Gmelina arborea is being investigated for transesterification into biofuels, a process that does not entirely maximize the bioenergy generated from the bioresources and generates further waste. However, pyrolysis can convert wholly the lignocellulose seed components into bioproducts with high-quality fuel properties without associated glycerol. Consequently, in this study, pyrolytic oil was produced from waste Gmelina arborea seed, the process parameters were optimized using the surface response methodology with experimental validations, the process model was established, and the pyrolytic oil was characterized. The optimum yield of 54 % at a temperature of 485 °C, a heating rate of 40 °C/min, and a particle size of 0.9 mm were established, and a corresponding regression model equation was developed. The Gmelina arborea seed biomass was revealed to have 81.95 % volatile matter with oil extractives of 44.80 %. The GC-MS analysis shows that the aliphatic hydrocarbon of a cyclic monoterpene occupies the highest concentration of 67.46 %. The fuel properties and the calorific value of 33.69 MJ/kg of the pyrolytic oil compared to ASTM standard specifications for pyrolytic liquid biofuel show suitability for commercial and industrial fuel. The absence of sulfur in the pyrolytic oil elemental analysis adds credence to its usefulness as a sustainable fuel.
