You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of second-stage bed materials on hydrogen production in the syngas of a two-stage gasification process This study investigated the effects of various bed materials (silica, biomass-based activated carbon, coal-based activated carbon, and zeolite) used in the second-stage reactor and different gasification conditions on the H2 fraction in the syngas. The equivalence ratio was fixed at 0.3, and the temperature in the first-stage reactor was held constant at 500 °C. Three temperatures were tested in the second-stage reactor, and the steam/biomass ratio was also tested. As shown in the experimental results, the combination of operating temperatures that gives the optimum percentage of H2 in the syngas is 500 °C/900 °C. The highest proportion of H2 formed at S/B = 0.6. As steam passes into the first-stage reactor, the operating temperature and, subsequently, the gasification efficiency can be lowered. The higher operating temperature of the second-stage reactor nevertheless reintroduced steam into the gasification reaction as it entered, raising the H2 content significantly. In addition, for the different bed materials used in the second stage, B-AC yielded the highest proportion of H2 in the syngas exiting the gasifier. The H2 fraction reached 50.96 mol% when S/B = 0.6 and the operation was carried out at 500 °C/900 °C. Among the four different bed materials, silica yielded the lowest H2 proportion of 36.66 mol%.
