High-performance chlorinated polyvinyl chloride/polyurea nanocomposite foam with excellent solvent resistance, flame-triggered shape memory effect and its upcycling Facing the global environmental pollution crisis related to waste plastics, the recyclable design of polymer materials and composites, especially large commodities, is the most effective and fundamental solution. Herein, an upcycling chlorinated polyvinyl chloride/polyurea (CPVC/PUA) nanocomposite foam was designed by means of the “plasticizing-foaming-reinforcing” (PFR) strategy combined with catalytic carbonization of CPVC/PUA foams. On one hand, the foam with ultra-high expansion ratio (62 times) can be facilely prepared in supercritical CO2 at lower temperature, benefited of the reactive plasticizing function of PUA monomer-polymeric methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (PMDI). On the other hand, the obtained foam is reinforced by PMDI crosslinking reaction to in situ form nano-PUA phase in the CPVC matrix and realizing robust and superior solvent resistance and flame-triggered shape memory effect. Moreover, the foam possesses remarkable ablation resistance, which is attributed to super carbonization capacity of CPVC catalyzed by PUA. This carbonization behavior endows the foam directly upcycle into functional carbon foam accompanied by the formation of HCl gas and functional aromatics. The obtained carbon foam shows attractive electromagnetic interference shielding performance, which also may be used as potential carbon source or catalyst of producing vinyl chloride monomer in the chlor-alkali industry, especially in China.
