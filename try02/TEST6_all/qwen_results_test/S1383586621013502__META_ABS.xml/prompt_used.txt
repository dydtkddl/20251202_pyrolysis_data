You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a three-dimensional photoelectrocatalytic reactor packed with granular sludge carbon photoelectrocatalyst for efficient wastewater treatment The application of photocatalysis/electrocatalysis in wastewater treatment is constrained by their inherent drawbacks, such as the low utilization efficiency of light for photocatalysis, and the diffusional limitations for electrocatalysis. In this work, a novel three-dimensional photoelectrocatalytic reactor (3D-PER) is developed to degrade Rhodamine B (RhB) simulated wastewater. The granular sewage sludge carbons (GSCs) are fabricated and filled into the 3D-PER as particle catalysts, which exert both photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The decolorization efficiency of RhB is over 95% in the 3D-PER with the synergy of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Especially, the hollow structure of GSC-15 improves the decolorization efficiency of RhB, and exhibits a stable treatment performance over 11 continuous cycles. GSC-15 has hierarchical pore structure with abundant active sites, showing a higher degradation rate to RhB than GSC. The contributions of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis to RhB degradation are identified, that photocatalysis primarily initializes decolorization, while electrocatalysis plays a critical role in mineralization. Meanwhile, the toxicity of 3D-PER effluent is largely reduced for the efficient decomposition of toxic intermediates. This study demonstrates the efficacy of 3D-PER in refractory wastewater treatment, benefitting to the promotion of 3D-PER in environmental applications.
