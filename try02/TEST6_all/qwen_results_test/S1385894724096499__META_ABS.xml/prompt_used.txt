You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-step conversion of waste plastic into light olefins and aromatics on metal-free carbon felt catalyst under radiofrequency heating Plastic waste represents the most serious global problem for ecosystem and environmental balance, which urges the development of new recycling process for the improvement of circular economy. Chemical recycling of waste plastic to produce back light olefins, ethylene and propylene, is of high interest to reduce the use of fossil sources and allows the direct re-use of waste plastic with a concomitant reduction of associated carbon footprint. In this present work, we report on the development of metal-free carbon catalyst, with high deactivation resistance, coupled with contactless induction heating with high heat efficiency and low energy for the direct conversion of waste plastics back to light olefins and aromatics. Such process is critical yet challenging in industrial applications. Relevant characterizations proved that exclusive surface heating, significantly improves the selective cracking of waste plastics, either model or industrial ones, to produce light olefins and aromatics during long-term operating process. The commercial carbon felt displays remarkable performance for the chemical recycling of waste plastics, surpassing the conventional metal and zeolite catalysts for such relevant environmental problem. The influence of an alternating magnetic field on the catalytic mechanism is advanced to explain such high performance.
