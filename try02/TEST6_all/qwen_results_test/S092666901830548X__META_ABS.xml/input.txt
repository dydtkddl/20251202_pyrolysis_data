Comparative study of the fast pyrolysis behavior of ginkgo, poplar, and wheat straw lignin at different temperatures Fast pyrolysis of milled wood lignin (MWL) isolated from ginkgo (soft wood), wheat straw (herbaceous biomass), and poplar (hardwood) were conducted at various temperatures (400/600/800 °C) and the liquid products were analyzed by GC–MS. Then all MWLs were fully characterized using GPC, TGA, FT-IR, 2D NMR, and elemental analyses. Ginkgo MWL showed higher selectivity toward guaiacols (92.38%) at low temperature (400 °C), especially a higher selectivity for five useful compounds (67.7%), namely creosol (10.24%), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (17.83%), vanillin (15.65%), isoeugenol (14.84%), and apocynin (9.14%), as compared to MWLs from wheat straw or poplar. Overall, ginkgo lignin exhibits vast potential for volatilization at low temperature-selective pyrolysis, because it retains highly concentrated guaiacol-type structures which are easy to deconstruct and a few β-5′ phenylcoumarans that are hard to crack.
