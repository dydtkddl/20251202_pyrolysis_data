You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sulphated zirconia catalysed conversion of high density polyethylene to value-added products using a fixed-bed reactor A sulphated zirconia catalyst (SZ) was investigated for catalytic conversion of high density polyethylene (HDPE) to liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons using a fixed-bed reactor. The SZ catalyst reduced the onset of degradation from 337°C for HDPE alone to 187°C with 10wt% SZ added. At 450°C a complete weight loss was obtained with the SZ addition against only 4wt% loss for HDPE only. Fixed-bed reactor experiments using 2g of HDPE with 10wt% SZ catalyst with a 30min residence time showed a 98.0wt% conversion at temperature as low as 380°C. The liquid yield obtained was 39.0wt% with a composition of 16wt% paraffins, 21wt% olefins, 5wt% naphthenes and 58wt% aromatics. The carbon number distribution of the liquid was C7–C12, which is within the gasoline range. Equally, gaseous products ranging from methane up to different isomers of pentane which contained more paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbon were obtained. The sulphated zirconia catalyst was found to have high ammonia desorption (337.0μmolNH3 g−1), BET surface area (116.0m2 g−1), external surface area (112.0m2 g−1) and mesoporous structure. The overall results indicate that sulphated zirconia had excellent properties for catalytic conversion at temperature as low as 380°C with significant liquid yield which could offer a solution to plastic waste problem by converting the waste back into value-added chemicals and fuel.
