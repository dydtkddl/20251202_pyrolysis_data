You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Switchable biomaterials for wastewater treatment: From material innovations to technological advancements Switchable biomaterials have emerged as promising solutions for sustainable and cost-effective wastewater treatment, leveraging stimuli-responsive functionalities for efficient pollutant removal and material recyclability. This review explores the applications and challenges of chitosan, polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose, biochar, rubber, resin, and crude fibers, emphasizing their adsorption capacities, stability, and scalability. Switchable cellulose materials, widely used in dye removal and oil–water separation, exhibit adsorption capacities of 10–52 g/g, yet require mechanical reinforcement for harsh wastewater environments. Heteroatom-doped biochar, with high surface areas (>500 m2/g) and porosities, achieves heavy metal adsorption efficiencies exceeding 90%, though feedstock variability affects consistency. Functionalized rubber, resin, and fibers demonstrate over 90% oil–water separation efficiency, benefiting from tunable surface properties and self-cleaning abilities. Despite these advantages, challenges remain in enhancing scalability, recyclability, and multi-contaminant adaptability. While mild regeneration methods, such as CO2 bubbling and pH adjustments, reduce energy demands, synthesis processes still require optimization for industrial viability. Future efforts should focus on hybrid biomaterials, low-energy synthesis techniques, and integration into existing treatment systems to maximize their long-term sustainability and real-world impact.
