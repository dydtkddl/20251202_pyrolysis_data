Additive manufacturing of three-dimensional graphene-based architectures and its application in environmental treatment: A review Graphene, as a new class of nanomaterials, demonstrates great potential in environmental treatment, while the shape of graphene powder state limits its use. Thus, the construction of large-volume three-dimensional graphene structures is of great significance for practical applications. In this paper, the commonly used methods for the preparation of three-dimensional structures nowadays are introduced, such as the template method and self-assembly method. Nonetheless, these methods have disadvantages such as tedious steps, more influencing factors, and required conditions, leading to structural defects during the process and thus affecting the mechanical properties of the fabricated three-dimensional structures. Additive manufacturing stands out in the preparation of three-dimensional graphene with the advantages of easy operation, precise structural design, and batch preparation. The preparation methods based on graphene macroscopic bodies and their applications in environmental treatment are reviewed, and the macro-microstructure modulation and applications in water treatment are described. Additionally, conclusions and outlooks are provided in the final part, involving the difficulties and future development of three-dimensional graphene architectures for applications.
