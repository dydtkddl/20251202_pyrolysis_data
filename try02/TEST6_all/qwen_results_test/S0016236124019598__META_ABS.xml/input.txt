Physical characteristics and combustion behavior of pellets from sawdust and refuse-derived fuel Experimental research findings are reported on the ignition and combustion behavior, as well as mechanical properties of pellets from wood biomass (pine sawdust) and additives of refuse-derived fuel (cardboard, plastic and their mixture). The addition of RDF was found to increase the vibration durability and moisture resistance of pellets by 3.7–45.6% % compared to samples without additives. Cardboard and its mixture with plastic contributed to 2.7–5.8% greater density of pellets % compared to wood pellets. The impact resistance coefficient of pellets with waste decreased by 0.3– 2.3% compared to samples without additives. An increase in the proportion of cardboard and plastic led to longer delay times of the gas-phase and heterogeneous ignition. The ignition delay times decreased by a factor of 1.3–2.2 as a result of mixing cardboard with plastic compared to pellets with only cardboard or plastic. On the environmental side, the use of cardboard in pellets reduced the concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide by 10–24 % and 5–46%, respectively, compared to samples without additives. By contrast, the addition of plastic waste increased CO2 and CO by 4–15% and 5–63%, respectively. The combustion of pellets with RDF was characterized by 22–78% lower concentrations of NOx. The results of a multi-criteria decision analysis revealed that the use of RDF in wood pellets increased the efficiency indicator by 1 to 12% compared to wood pellets.
