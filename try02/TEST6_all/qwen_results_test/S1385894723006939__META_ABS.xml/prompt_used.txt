You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling plastic waste to carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion Plastic pollution is triggering a global environmental crisis, prompting incremental efforts in recycling and upcycling to unlock the hidden value. Converting plastic waste into value-added carbon-based materials provides attractive options for electrochemical energy applications. This review initially summarizes the available plastic waste feedstock concerning the contained elements for carbon-based materials. Then, the transformation process of plastics into carbon-based electrode materials including carbon quantum dots, carbon nanospheres, carbon nanosheets, carbon nanotubes, 3D porous carbon, and carbon-based composites, and their electrochemical applications based on structural characteristics are comprehensively reviewed. In this part, the superiority and drawbacks of different plastics-to-carbon transformation systems, and the relationships between dimensional carbon structures and electrocatalytic performances for energy storage and conversion are discussed. Finally, existing challenges and outlook of controllable upcycling of plastic waste into carbonous materials for electrochemical applications are presented. This review provides inspiration on the exploration of advanced techniques for upgrading discarded plastics for energy applications, and forward-looking ideas for achieving sustainability and profitability in the plastics value chain management.
