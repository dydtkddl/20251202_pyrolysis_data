You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of biofuel via catalytic fast pyrolysis of wood-plastic composite over low-cost catalysts Thermogravimetric (TG) and pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analyses were performed to know the feasibility of low cost catalysts, γ-Al2O3, spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst, natural zeolite, to the pyrolysis of wood-plastic composite (WPC). Notably, the respective decomposition temperature of polyethylene and polypropylene in WPC was lowered with the use of low-cost catalysts during the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). Furthermore, the lowest activation energy (Ea) of the CFP, obtained by the Ozawa method, was with the use of natural zeolite (127.5 kJ/mol), followed by the ones with the use of spent FCC catalyst (133.3 kJ/mol) and γ-Al2O3 (145.0 kJ/mol), respectively. In addition, the CFP over natural zeolite was less effective in terms of decreasing the production of low-quality hydrocarbons, paraffins and olefins having a wide carbon number distribution, and oxygenates compared to that over spent FCC catalyst and γ-Al2O3, respectively, due to the small pore size of natural zeolite. However, the largest amount of value-added aromatic hydrocarbons was produced in the CFP over natural zeolite among all the catalysts due to the high and strong acidity of natural zeolite.
