  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on co-gasification of HDPE with biomass using a two-stage system involving oxidative pyrolysis and thermal plasma, but does not involve pyrolysis of plastic alone or as a primary focus, and the process is not classified as plastic pyrolysis due to the dominant role of biomass and gasification mechanisms."
