You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress in dynamic simulation of thermal power plants While the conventional design of thermal power plants is mainly focused on high process efficiency, market requirements increasingly target operating flexibility due to the continuing shift towards renewables. Dynamic simulation is a cost-efficient tool for improving the flexibility of dispatchable power generation in transient operation such as load changes and start-up procedures. Specific applications include the optimisation of control structures, stress assessment for critical components and plant safety analysis in malfunction cases. This work is a comprehensive review of dynamic simulation, its development and application to various thermal power plants. The required mathematical models and various components for description the basic process, automation and electrical systems of thermal power plants are explained with the support of practical example models. The underlying flow models and their fundamental assumptions are discussed, complemented by an overview of commonly used simulation codes. Relevant studies are summarised and placed in context for different thermal power plant technologies: combined-cycle power, coal-fired power, nuclear power, concentrated solar power, geothermal power, municipal waste incineration and thermal desalination. Particular attention is given to those studies that include measurement validation in order to analyse the influence of model simplifications on simulation results. In conclusion, the study highlights current research efforts and future development potential of dynamic simulation in the field of thermal power generation.
