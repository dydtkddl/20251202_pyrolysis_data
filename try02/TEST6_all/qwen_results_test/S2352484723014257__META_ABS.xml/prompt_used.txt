You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Standard diesel production from mixed waste plastics through thermal pyrolysis and vacuum distillation Plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) was produced in a pilot-scale batch pyrolysis reactor at 540 °C from mixed waste plastic (MWP) (high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS)). The produced PPO was then distilled in a vacuum distillation unit and diesel was obtained at temperatures between 170 and 380 °C along with light petrol (380 °C). This study found that MWP can produce over 80% liquid oils without operational problems or wax formation. Distilled PPO produces 49.5–53% diesel, 39 – 46.5% petrol and residue 1.5 – 8% by weight. Although PPO has calorific value ranging from 43.85 to 45.26 MJ/kg like commercial diesel however, PPO is not suitable for direct use in diesel engine for low kinematic viscosity (KV) and density values at 1.1–1.26 mm2/s and 0.78 – 0.83 gm/cm3 respectively. For the distilled diesel cut (DC), KV, density, higher heating value (HHV), cetane index (CI), aromatic hydrocarbon (AH) and poli-aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) were found 1.95–2.15 mm2/s, 0.81 – 0.85 gm/cm3, 44.92–46.36 MJ/kg, 46 – 58, 18.81 – 35.1% and 4.81 – 11.9% respectively indicating better option for direct use as automobile diesel with significant effect of HDPE amount present in feedstock.
