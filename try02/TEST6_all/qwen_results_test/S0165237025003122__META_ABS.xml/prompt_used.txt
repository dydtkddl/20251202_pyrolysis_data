You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing carbon negative potential in CO2-mediated pyrolysis of agricultural residue Wheat straw (WS), one of the most abundant agricultural residues, has garnered attention as a renewable alternative to petroleum-derived carbon resources. However, current biofuel production faces challenges in realizing efficient carbon use. To address this, pyrolysis offers a promising platform capable of converting all the carbon in WS into value-added pyrogenic products such as syngas, biocrude, and biochar. This study focused on enhancing carbon-negative potential of WS pyrolysis by incorporating carbon dioxide (CO₂) as partial oxidant and carbon resource. At temperatures ≥ 430˚C, CO₂ interacted homogeneously with volatiles pyrolyzed from WS and converted them into carbon monoxide (CO), contributing to carbon-negative character to the pyrolysis system. To accelerate the kinetics of CO₂-driven reactions, the pyrolysis setup was systematically modified by delivering an additional heat and introducing a nickel catalyst. Additionally, two process parameters (reaction temperature and CO₂ concentration) were tailored to optimize CO-rich syngas production. The energy requirements and net CO₂ emissions of CO₂-mediated catalytic pyrolysis were evaluated under optimal conditions. CO₂-mediated catalytic pyrolysis of WS demonstrated a carbon-negative potential of 1260 mg CO2 per gram of WS. Therefore, this finding offers opportunities to suppress 1235 million tons of CO₂ annually across the agricultural sector linked to wheat straw harvest.
