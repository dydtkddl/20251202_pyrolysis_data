Carbon nanofibers with nanoporosity and hollow channels from binary polyacrylonitrile systems Carbon nanofibers with new structural features, e.g. nanoporosity, hollow, U-shape cross-section, were generated by utilizing the phase separation behavior of polymer additive with polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The approach involved the formation of precursor fibers by electrospinning of binary mixtures of PAN with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), cellulose acetate (CA) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the removal of the polymer and the carbonization of the remaining PAN. The carbon nanofiber yield was ca 50% of PAN in all cases. Nanoporous carbon nanofibers with an average diameter of 100nm were generated from the water treated PAN/PEO precursors. Multi-channel hollow fibers (90–190nm diameters) were produced from the acetone treated PAN/CA precursors. Carbon fibers produced from the chloroform treated PAN/PMMA precursors were 250–400nm in diameters and consisted of varied hollow structures, i.e., hollow and U-shape cross-sections from those containing 30% and 50% PAN, respectively, and multi-channel hollow fibers from the 70/30 PAN/PMMA precursor. Carbonization of equal-mass PAN/PMMA as-spun fibers also produced similarly U-shape cross-sections as the chloroform treated ones, showing promise of direct carbonization. This simple and yet versatile approach to create new structural features in carbonized fibers has shown to depend on the distinct phase separation as well as the pyrolytic behaviors of the second polymer component.
