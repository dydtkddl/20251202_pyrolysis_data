You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanofibers with nanoporosity and hollow channels from binary polyacrylonitrile systems Carbon nanofibers with new structural features, e.g. nanoporosity, hollow, U-shape cross-section, were generated by utilizing the phase separation behavior of polymer additive with polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The approach involved the formation of precursor fibers by electrospinning of binary mixtures of PAN with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), cellulose acetate (CA) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), the removal of the polymer and the carbonization of the remaining PAN. The carbon nanofiber yield was ca 50% of PAN in all cases. Nanoporous carbon nanofibers with an average diameter of 100nm were generated from the water treated PAN/PEO precursors. Multi-channel hollow fibers (90–190nm diameters) were produced from the acetone treated PAN/CA precursors. Carbon fibers produced from the chloroform treated PAN/PMMA precursors were 250–400nm in diameters and consisted of varied hollow structures, i.e., hollow and U-shape cross-sections from those containing 30% and 50% PAN, respectively, and multi-channel hollow fibers from the 70/30 PAN/PMMA precursor. Carbonization of equal-mass PAN/PMMA as-spun fibers also produced similarly U-shape cross-sections as the chloroform treated ones, showing promise of direct carbonization. This simple and yet versatile approach to create new structural features in carbonized fibers has shown to depend on the distinct phase separation as well as the pyrolytic behaviors of the second polymer component.
