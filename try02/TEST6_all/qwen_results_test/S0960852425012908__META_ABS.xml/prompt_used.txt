You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Torrefaction coupled oxy-fuel co-combustion of Chinese medicine residue and pharmaceutical sludge: Combustion characteristics and synergistic effects Oxy-fuel combustion, a promising technology for CO2 capture, can significantly enhance combustion performance. This study investigates the synergistic co-disposal of Chinese medicine residue (CMR) and its associated pharmaceutical sludge (PS) via a coupled torrefaction and oxy-fuel combustion process. The properties of the torrefied feedstock, the co-combustion characteristics under oxy-fuel conditions, and the underlying synergistic mechanisms were investigated. The findings indicate that the co-combustion of raw CMR and PS demonstrated significant synergy, with a lower ignition temperature and a combustion index (CCI) more than seven times the theoretical value. Torrefaction pretreatment further upgraded the fuel, increasing its higher heating value (HHV) by 7.6 %, boosting its BET surface area by 111 %, and lowering its ignition temperature in air by 47.5 %. Increasing the O2 concentration from 21 % to 31 % intensified combustion, reducing the CO peak from 19.30 % to 3.80 %, halving the burnout time, and lowering the activation energy. The integrated strategy of torrefaction coupled with 31 % O2 oxy-fuel combustion was found to be optimal, compressing the incomplete combustion window and enhancing CO2 enrichment in the flue gas. This combined process provides a robust pathway for the clean valorization of these wastes, establishing a solid foundation for integration with Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technologies.
