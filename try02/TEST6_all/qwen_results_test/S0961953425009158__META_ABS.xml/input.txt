A thermodynamic model for co-gasification of Parthenium hysterophorus (weed biomass) and plastic wastes: Assessing syngas quality and energy potential Plastic waste accumulation and invasive weed overgrowth are two pressing issues in many developing nations. Co-gasification offers a flexible solution, converting diverse feedstocks into energy while mitigating waste. This study simulates the co-gasification of Parthenium hysterophorus with plastic wastes (polyethylene and polystyrene) to produce sustainable syngas. A validated MATLAB model examines the effects of plastic type on syngas composition, H 2/CO and CO/CO 2 ratios, syngas yield, and lower heating value, while also considering operating parameters such as steam to feedstock ratio, gasification temperature, pressure, and feedstock moisture content. It is found that adding polyethylene to the blend (PH-PE) enhances H 2 and CH 4 production (6.98 % and 47.40 %, respectively) more than polystyrene in the blend (PH-PS, 0.98 % and 33.03 %, respectively), while polystyrene favours higher CO formation (46.82 % vs 31.38 % for polyethylene). The H 2/CO ratio rises with increasing steam to feedstock ratio (PH–PE: 185.66 %, PH–PS: 203.10 %), pressure (PH–PE: 4.63 %, PH–PS: 2.12 %), and moisture content in biomass (PH–PE: 1.65 %, PH–PS: 1.73 %). Conversely, the CO/CO 2 ratio decreases with higher steam input, pressure, and moisture, but rises with increasing plastic content (PH–PE: 361.90 %, PH–PS: 408.74 %) and gasification temperature (PH–PE: 252.65 %, PH–PS: 240.66 %). The lower heating value of the syngas is positively influenced by plastic content in feedstock (PH–PE: 45.01 %, PH–PS: 34.83 %), temperature (PH–PE: 9.01 %, PH–PS: 10.31 %), and pressure (PH–PE: 0.43 % only). Changes in moisture content in the plastic have negligible effects on the performance parameters of both blends.
