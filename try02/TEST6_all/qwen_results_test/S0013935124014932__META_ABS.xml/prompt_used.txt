You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of novel glutathione-Fe3O4-loaded/activated carbon encapsulated sand bionanocomposites for enhanced removal of diethyl phthalate from aqueous environment in a vertical flow reactor The extensive use of plasticizers in various industries has made Diethyl phthalate (DEP), a serious threat to the environment and ecological water security, owing to its complex-structure and low-biodegradability. Thus, the present study aimed to design a sustainable sand-coated nano glutathione (GSH) -Fe3O4-loaded/activated carbon (AC) bionanocomposite (AC-GSH-Fe3O4@sand bionanocomposite) for effective removal of DEP from water. Characterization results suggested bionanocomposites' rough and irregular texture due to the uneven distribution of AC and Fe3O4 nanoparticles over the sand. The XRD spectra indicated high crystallinity of bionanocomposites, while the FTIR spectra confirmed the presence of all individual components, i.e., GSH, AC, Fe3O4, and sand. EDX-mapping, AFM, and TGA further verified its elemental composition, topographical changes and thermal stability. The inﬂuence of pH (3, 7, 9), bed height (2, 4, 6) cm, and flow rate (2.5, 3.5, 4.5) mL min−1 were studied in a dynamic system with an initial DEP concentration of 50 mg L−1 to investigate the removal behavior of the bionanocomposites. The best DEP removal efficiency (90.18 %) was achieved over 28-h at pH 9, bed-height-4 cm, and flow-rate-3.5 mL min−1, with an optimum qmax-200.25 mg g−1 as determined through Thomas-model. Breakthrough curves were predicted using various column models, and the corresponding parameters essential for column-reactor process design were calculated. The high reusability up to the 10th cycle (≥83.32%) and the effective treatment in complex matrices (tap-water: 90.11 %, river-water: 89.72 %, wastewater: 83.83%) demonstrated bionanocomposites’ prominent sustainability. Additionally, the production cost at 6.64 USD per Kg, underscores its potentiality for industrial application. Phytotoxicity assessment on mung-bean revealed better root (5.02 ± 0.27 cm) and shoot (17.64 ± 0.35 cm) growth in the bionanocomposite-treated DEP samples over the untreated samples. Thus, AC-GSH-Fe3O4@sand bionanocomposites could be considered a highly-sustainable, low-cost technique for the effective removal of DEP and other phthalate-esters from contaminated matrices.
