Waste tire rubber-based materials: Processing, performance properties and development strategies In the many countries the main strategy for waste tires utilization is still energy recovery, which use waste tires as low-cost and high-calorific alternative fuel. Although, energy recovery is step forward for suitable waste tires collection and management, it should not be considered as a green and environmentally-friendly method. Waste tires recycling and upcycling technologies are crucial for further realization of circular economy strategies. Therefore, improvement of already existed and searching for new methods of waste tires industrial applications are fully justified. In this work, recent advances in development of waste tire rubber-based materials characterized by high content of ground tire rubber (defined as minimum 70 wt%) are presented and discussed. A special attention was focused on the correlation between sustainable treatment or functionalization of waste tire rubber and the structure–property relationships of the prepared materials. Moreover, the main problems and challenges affecting the possible industrial application of materials highly modified by waste tire rubber are also highlighted.
