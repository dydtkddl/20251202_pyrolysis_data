You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Designing nitrogen-enriched heterogeneous NiS@CoNi2S4 embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon with hierarchical 2D/3D nanocage structure for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution and triiodide reduction Fabrication of efficient non-precious electrocatalysts with hierarchical nanostructures and the desired compositions is highly desirable to enhance the catalytic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and triiodide reduction reaction (IRR). This work proposes a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) template-based strategy to generate sulfide embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon with a hierarchical 2D/3D nanocage structure. ZIF-67, as a sacrificial template, is first etched to form 2D/3D NiCo layered double hydroxide/2-Methylimidazole (NiCo LDH/MeIm) and then converted to CoNi2S4 nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (CoNi2S4/NC) through one-step sulfurization and pyrolysis. When a core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 is designed as a template for the generation of Ni@NiCo LDH/MeIm, the obtained NiS@CoNi2S4/NC not only retains the unique 2D/3D nanostructure but also has a high N content, abundant active sites, larger specific surface area, and hierarchical pore distribution. NiS@CoNi2S4/NC mediates an overpotential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 47.2 mV dec-1 in the alkaline HER. The solar cell equipped with NiS@CoNi2S4/NC as the IRR catalyst achieves a high cell efficiency of 7.96 %. NiS@CoNi2S4/NC shows durably high HER and IRR activity. This controllable synthetic strategy provides a valuable support for developing efficient catalysts in electrocatalytic energy conversion systems.
