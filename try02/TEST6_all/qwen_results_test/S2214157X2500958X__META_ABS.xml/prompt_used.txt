You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of textile sludge pyrolysis behaviour through advance predictive models for bioenergy production Managing the textile sludge has become a significant global challenge because it is often disposed of in landfills without recovering its energy potential. Pyrolysis has emerged as a promising technology to extract energy and valuable chemicals from textile sludge. This study investigates the pyrolysis of textile sludge through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) conducted from ambient temperature to 1000 °C at three different heating rates of 2.5, 5 and 7.5 °C/min in an inert environment. The kinetic study complemented was isoconversional method which includes both differential and integral (Friedman, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall & Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose) method. Moreover, five pseudo-components (pc1, pc2, pc3, pc4, pc5) were obtained by multi distributed activation energy model (M-DAEM). Additionally, combined kinetics retrieves the Ea of 98.3(±3.6) kJ/mol with R2 value of 0.9924. Furthermore, pyrolysis of textile sludge was performed in fixed bed reactor (FBR) at 500 °C that results in a pyro-oil, non-condensable gases and the biochar yields 17.5(±1.7) %, 13.7 (±3) % and 68.8 (±1.3) % respectively. To optimize the pyrolysis of textile sludge, it is essential to comprehend the complex kinetics involved in its degradation. Machine learning models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Classification and Regression Trees (C&RT), Boosted regression trees (BRT), and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) employed to predict the activation energy (Ea) with ANN emerging as superior predicting capabilities (R2 = 0.999) over other models. This study demonstrates the remarkable ability of ANN, C&RT, BRT and KNN to accurately analyze complex relationships, predicts the textile sludge pyrolysis kinetics and confirms the potential of textile sludge pyrolysis as a sustainable and efficient energy source.
