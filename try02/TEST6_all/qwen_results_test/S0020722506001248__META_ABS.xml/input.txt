Heat treatment of chlorinated waste in a rotating kiln: Problems with intermediate reaction products and solutions applied At the CEA, the incineration of radioactive wastes is carried out thanks to the IRIS process involving a oxidizing pyrolysis step performed with a rotary kiln. If the running of the process is very satisfactory for processing waste of a given composition, it appears that the behavior of the kiln may diverge when the composition of the waste change. Through the example of wastes containing a large amount of PVC and thanks to a very simple modelling of the heating of the kiln, it has been demonstrated that the deposits are involved in overheating of the pyrolysis kiln. Fundamental investigation carried out about the thermal degradation of PVC and cellulose have shown that the formation of intermediate PVC decomposition compounds together with the residues coming from the decomposition of the cellulose could be responsible of the large amount of deposits. In order to avoid the malfunctions it has been proposed to revise the furnace operating parameters by specifying a waste feed sequence that ensure a relaxation period to the furnace. By this way, the running of the facility shows a very good stability with a very thin temperature oscillation that can easily be explained by a thermal modelling of the kiln.
