Findings and perspectives of β-Ti alloys with biomedical applications: Exploring beyond biomechanical and biofunctional behaviour Early implant failure and bone resorption may occur in load-bearing conditions as a result of stress shielding brought on by a mismatch in the bone-Ti-implant modulus. A review with a novel multidisciplinary perspective is proposed in this work, which considers recent developments of β-Titanium alloys and new trends in novel microstructures, processing techniques, properties of dense and porous substrates, as well as the relationship between all these aspects and performance in service, in terms of improved its biomechanical and bio-functional balance. In addition to highlighting several modern and historical uses for Ti alloys, this review covers many cutting-edge novel β-Ti alloys and uses that promise to exceed historical standards. Also, it deepens through several important properties of these alloys, including toxicity of alloying elements, phase stability, thermo-mechanical processing, heat treatment, surface, and stress-induced modifications. The stiffness, hardness, fatigue and wear resistance, corrosion behaviour, biocompatibility, and manufacturing and surface modification effects on these parameters are also emphasized. In-vitro and in-vivo assays have been added to highlight important aspects of bioactivity and antibacterial behaviour, and future significant research areas are suggested along with new techniques to ensure the successful clinical application of β-Ti alloys.
