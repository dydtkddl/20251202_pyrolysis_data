You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Findings and perspectives of β-Ti alloys with biomedical applications: Exploring beyond biomechanical and biofunctional behaviour Early implant failure and bone resorption may occur in load-bearing conditions as a result of stress shielding brought on by a mismatch in the bone-Ti-implant modulus. A review with a novel multidisciplinary perspective is proposed in this work, which considers recent developments of β-Titanium alloys and new trends in novel microstructures, processing techniques, properties of dense and porous substrates, as well as the relationship between all these aspects and performance in service, in terms of improved its biomechanical and bio-functional balance. In addition to highlighting several modern and historical uses for Ti alloys, this review covers many cutting-edge novel β-Ti alloys and uses that promise to exceed historical standards. Also, it deepens through several important properties of these alloys, including toxicity of alloying elements, phase stability, thermo-mechanical processing, heat treatment, surface, and stress-induced modifications. The stiffness, hardness, fatigue and wear resistance, corrosion behaviour, biocompatibility, and manufacturing and surface modification effects on these parameters are also emphasized. In-vitro and in-vivo assays have been added to highlight important aspects of bioactivity and antibacterial behaviour, and future significant research areas are suggested along with new techniques to ensure the successful clinical application of β-Ti alloys.
