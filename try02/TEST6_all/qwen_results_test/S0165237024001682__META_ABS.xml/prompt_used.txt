You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced production of naphtha-range compounds from arundo donax via catalytic fast pyrolysis using SAPO-11 Arundo donax, acknowledged for its elevated energy content, substantial biomass yield and rapid growth, stands as an alluring candidate for biofuel production. In this investigation, a molecular sieve-based catalyst was utilized to scrutinize the catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of Arundo donax, aiming for the production of naphtha-range compounds. The study also encompassed the evaluation of pyrolysis product yields within a fixed-bed reactor. The systematic exploration included an assessment of the impacts arising from catalyst type, temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), and N2 flow rate. The results demonstrated that at 500 °C, WHSV of 1 h−1 and N2 flow rate of 300 ml/min, SAPO-11 exhibited a selectivity of 64.55% to naphtha-range compounds and 64.55% to isomerous naphtha-range compounds. This was in stark contrast to the control group, which contained no catalyst (with a selectivity of 41.40% and 3.19%, respectively), SAPO-41 (with a selectivity of 11.02% and 9.55%, respectively) and HZSM-5 (with a selectivity of 59.89% and 53.51%, respectively). Additionally, SAPO-11 yielded the highest bio-oil compared to other catalysts (SAPO-11 of 28.52 wt% > none of 19.48 wt% > HZSM-5 of 18.90 wt% > SAPO-41 of 13.11 wt%). The conclusions drawn from these findings imply that the synthesized SAPO-11 catalyst exhibited superior catalytic activity and isomerization proficiency in contrast to other catalysts (SAPO-41 and HZSM-5). Remarkably, under the specified conditions of SAPO-11 catalyst, temperature = 500 °C, WHSV = 1 h−1 and N2 flow rate = 200 ml/min, the CFP process yielded a remarkable maximum absolute yield of the naphtha-range compound at 25.82 wt%, with an isomerized naphtha-range compound absolute yield of 25.35 wt%.
