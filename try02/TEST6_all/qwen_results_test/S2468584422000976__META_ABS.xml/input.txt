Microplastic contamination around the landfills: Distribution, characterization and threats: A review Microplastics (MPs) around the landfill site have been few studies thus far. The most recent studies have focussed on MP pollution in freshwater, marine, and sediment environments. Conversely, soil, a significant sink of MPs, it has had less scientific attention until now. On the other hand, atmospheric MPs are growing pollutants that have recently been a cause for worry on worldwide. Consequently, the review is focused on the following goals: 1) to study about how microplastic is distributed in aquatic, terrestrial, and atmospheric environments; 2) to give specifics on the many techniques used to characterise and identify microplastic; and 3) to discuss about challenges to the ecosystem, animals, and humans. This review will advance our knowledge of dissemination, characterisation, and threats of microplastics around landfill systems. In order to find areas where the study of microplastic can be improved, it is required to review the current literature on the subject.
