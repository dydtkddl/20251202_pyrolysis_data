You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the contribution of unknown precursors and short-chain (C2–C3) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids at solid waste disposal facilities The emission of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from municipal solid wastes (MSW) disposal raises concerns for their potential of long-term release and risks. In this study, the occurrence of PFASs was investigated in ambient air and leachate from seven MSW disposal facilities including three landfills, two incineration plants, and two MSW transfer stations in Tianjin, China. Mass loads of PFASs (≥C4) released to the atmosphere were estimated at 0.007–0.97 kg/y/site, which were much lower than those to leachate (0.04–1.3 kg/y/site), while emission to the atmosphere at landfills was more considerable. With total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay, unknown C4–C12 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs)-precursors were found contributing 10–97 mol% in leachate and accounting for additional 15%–43% mass loads. Using IC-Ba/Ag/H cartridges, trifluoroacetic acid (C2) and perfluoropropionic acid (C3) were recovered in leachate for TOP assay (62%–78%) and determined at dominant levels of 19–81 μg/L, which accounted for mass loads of 0.08–2.6 kg/y/site. Unknown C2–C3 PFAA-precursors contributed 12–93 mol% with mass loads of 0.10–3.0 kg/y/site. Overall, unknown C2–C12 PFAA-precursors remained contributing 0.35–68 mol% in biochemically treated leachate. This study emphasizes that the profiles of unknown PFAA-precursors released during MSW disposal are to be identified, which is essential for their environmental risk assessment.
