Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and the contribution of unknown precursors and short-chain (C2–C3) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids at solid waste disposal facilities The emission of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from municipal solid wastes (MSW) disposal raises concerns for their potential of long-term release and risks. In this study, the occurrence of PFASs was investigated in ambient air and leachate from seven MSW disposal facilities including three landfills, two incineration plants, and two MSW transfer stations in Tianjin, China. Mass loads of PFASs (≥C4) released to the atmosphere were estimated at 0.007–0.97 kg/y/site, which were much lower than those to leachate (0.04–1.3 kg/y/site), while emission to the atmosphere at landfills was more considerable. With total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay, unknown C4–C12 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs)-precursors were found contributing 10–97 mol% in leachate and accounting for additional 15%–43% mass loads. Using IC-Ba/Ag/H cartridges, trifluoroacetic acid (C2) and perfluoropropionic acid (C3) were recovered in leachate for TOP assay (62%–78%) and determined at dominant levels of 19–81 μg/L, which accounted for mass loads of 0.08–2.6 kg/y/site. Unknown C2–C3 PFAA-precursors contributed 12–93 mol% with mass loads of 0.10–3.0 kg/y/site. Overall, unknown C2–C12 PFAA-precursors remained contributing 0.35–68 mol% in biochemically treated leachate. This study emphasizes that the profiles of unknown PFAA-precursors released during MSW disposal are to be identified, which is essential for their environmental risk assessment.
