You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of reduction temperatures of Ni-modified zeolites on the product distribution, catalyst deactivation, and reaction mechanism during polypropylene pyrolysis Introducing Ni into ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts stands as an efficacious strategy for augmenting catalytic activity in the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP). Thermal reduction using H2 serves as a customary approach to convert Ni2+ species to Ni0, bolstering the catalytic efficacy in aromatics conversion. However, thermal treatment is prone to precipitating the agglomeration of Ni metal, leading to a diminution in the active sites of the catalyst. Therefore, this work focused on the effect that arose from different reduction temperatures on the PP catalytic thermal degradation process. According to the analysis of the reduced Ni-modified ZSM-5 catalysts, the size of Ni particles loaded onto the ZSM-5 support progressively increased with escalating reduction temperatures, ranging from 21.7 to 30.5 nm. Excessive size hindered the conversion of Ni0 which played a key role in the acid properties. Moreover, it was discovered that the H2 yield and aromatics proportions increased linearly with the strong acid amount and total B/L ratio, respectively. By contrast, the modified catalyst treated at 500 °C displayed superior catalytic performance. Additionally, coke generation was favored by the enlarged size of Ni particles. These findings were instrumental in advancing the development of reduced metal catalysts utilized in the thermal conversion treatment of plastic waste.
