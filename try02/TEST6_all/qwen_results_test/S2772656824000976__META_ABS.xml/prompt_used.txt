You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The application of spent catalysts from catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste as solid functional materials Plastic consumption has surged due to population growth and shifts in consumer behavior. Upcycling aims to address plastic waste by finding innovative reuse strategies. By integrating waste plastic into new products and materials, upcycling supports a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economic model. This reduces the overall environmental footprint, including CO2 emissions, associated with plastic consumption. Moreover, converting plastic waste into carbon nanotubes, can effectively sequester carbon. This means that carbon is captured and stored in a stable form, preventing its release into the atmosphere as CO2. This contributes directly to reducing net emissions. Recent interest in upcycling strategies includes producing target-oriented catalysts to reform plastic waste into carbon nanotubes embedded spent catalysts, offering potential for various applications. However, research in this area is scattered and lacks comprehensive conclusions. This review critically examines the use of spent catalysts from plastic waste pyrolysis and identifies their suitability for practical applications. It suggests focusing on the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste for target-oriented catalysts, as they offer good hydrogen yield and post-pyrolysis use in targeted applications. The unique structure of these catalysts enhances performance compared to commercial alternatives, but post-treatment is crucial to remove impurities for optimal performance. The upcycling of plastic waste into CNTs-metal composites substantially contributes to Sustainable Development Goals 7, 9, 12 and 13, by taking action to combat climate change and by guaranteeing access to affordable, clean, and sustainable energy. This review aims to be helpful for researchers who are currently new to the topic and want to continue research in this domain.
