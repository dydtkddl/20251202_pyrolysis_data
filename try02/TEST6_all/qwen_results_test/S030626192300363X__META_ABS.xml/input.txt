A solar-biomass system associated with CO2 capture, power generation and waste heat recovery for syngas production from rice straw and microalgae: Technological, energy, exergy, exergoeconomic and environmental assessments Biomass, as a renewable energy, is a promising feedstock for energy production. In this study, sorption enhanced biomass chemical looping gasification integrated with solar, waste heat recovery and power generation subsystems for syngas production and power generation is assessed via technological, energy, exergy, exergoeconomic and environmental evaluations. Rice straw (system 1) and microalgae (system 2) are considered as feedstock for the proposed solar-biomass system. The obtained results confirm that system 1 can produced more H2 at lower amounts of oxygen carriers. In addition, the energy analysis reveals that whereas system 2 can generate more power, the energy efficiency of system 1 is 4.29 % more than system 2. Based on the exergy analysis, it is proved that system 1 is more sustainable than system 2 due to its lower exergy destruction. According to the exergoeconomic analysis, the fuel cost rate of system 1 is 67.66 $·h−1, which is increased to 116.90 $·h−1 and the fuel cost rate of system 2 is 221.9 $·h−1, which is increased to 271.69 90 $·h−1. Therefore, as the specific and exergetic product cost of system 1 is lower than system 2, it is more economic. Furthermore, analysis of the relative difference in cost units shows that system 2 has more potential for cost reduction, as compared to system 1. Finally, it is proved that system 1 is more environmentally friendly than system 2.
