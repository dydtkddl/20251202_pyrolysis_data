You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A solar-biomass system associated with CO2 capture, power generation and waste heat recovery for syngas production from rice straw and microalgae: Technological, energy, exergy, exergoeconomic and environmental assessments Biomass, as a renewable energy, is a promising feedstock for energy production. In this study, sorption enhanced biomass chemical looping gasification integrated with solar, waste heat recovery and power generation subsystems for syngas production and power generation is assessed via technological, energy, exergy, exergoeconomic and environmental evaluations. Rice straw (system 1) and microalgae (system 2) are considered as feedstock for the proposed solar-biomass system. The obtained results confirm that system 1 can produced more H2 at lower amounts of oxygen carriers. In addition, the energy analysis reveals that whereas system 2 can generate more power, the energy efficiency of system 1 is 4.29 % more than system 2. Based on the exergy analysis, it is proved that system 1 is more sustainable than system 2 due to its lower exergy destruction. According to the exergoeconomic analysis, the fuel cost rate of system 1 is 67.66 $·h−1, which is increased to 116.90 $·h−1 and the fuel cost rate of system 2 is 221.9 $·h−1, which is increased to 271.69 90 $·h−1. Therefore, as the specific and exergetic product cost of system 1 is lower than system 2, it is more economic. Furthermore, analysis of the relative difference in cost units shows that system 2 has more potential for cost reduction, as compared to system 1. Finally, it is proved that system 1 is more environmentally friendly than system 2.
