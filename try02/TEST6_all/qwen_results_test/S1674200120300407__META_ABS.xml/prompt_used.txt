You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a nanostructured filter for pyrolysis wax purification: Effects of particulate filter aids Wax obtained from the pyrolysis of polyethylene waste can contain inorganic contaminants and must be purified before application. We evaluated different filter aids (perlite, sand, and rice husk ash) for the filtration of a crude wax and a pyrolysis wax through a filter medium that was coated with nylon 6 nanofibers to improve filtration efficiency. We first examined the performance of the filter aids in improving crude wax filtration, with the filtration time, temperature, and pressure held constant at 1h, 170°C, and 2.5bar, respectively. Oily wax was then produced by pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) waste in the temperature range 425⿿475°C. The best filter aid was perlite, which had a filtrate production rate of 5.47ÿ10⿿5 m3/h. The highest oily wax yield (87.8%) was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature of 425°C. The assembly comprising the filter medium coated with nylon 6 nanofibers plus perlite as a filter aid was most suitable for removing impurities from the oily wax generated by the HDPE pyrolysis as it achieved a purification efficiency of 99.9%.
