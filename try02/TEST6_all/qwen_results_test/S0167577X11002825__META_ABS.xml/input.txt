Chirality-enriched semiconducting carbon nanotubes synthesized on high surface area MgO-supported catalyst Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a narrow diameter distribution were synthesized by radio frequency-Catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition (RF-CCVD) through the pyrolysis of CH4. Fe–Co bimetallic catalytic nanoclusters were supported on high-surface area MgO nanopowders and used in the nanotube synthesis process. Nanolog absorption fluorescence analysis was used to characterize the chiralities of the as-produced SWCNTs over this nanostructural catalyst. In the final SWCNT sample, the (7,5) semiconducting carbon nanotube species were found to be dominant, with a low chirality variation.
