You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Disposable wet-wipes as potential source of pollution: Multi-analytical investigation of the composition of fibres and additives Wet wipes are used as disposable products for personal hygiene care, domestic cleaning, and sanitary use. Increased use of wet wipes as a consequence of the global COVID-19 pandemic, along with the introduction of labelling to indicate that some wipes can be disposed of by flushing or are biodegradable, raise concerns about the risks associated to the release of microfibres and chemicals when wet wipes enter the sewage system and the environment. A key step in the study of the behaviour and fate of the impact of the disposal of single use wet wipes is their physical-chemical characterisation in terms of fibres and additives. We designed and applied a multi-analytical protocol based on evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) and multi-shot pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), to identify the chemical composition of the constituent materials of commercial wet wipes. Four different classes of wet wipes - certified and non-certified flushable, biodegradable, conventional - comprising a total of 12 types of samples were analysed in terms of fibre composition and organic additives. EGA-MS and Py-GC-MS analysis confirmed that all flushable and biodegradable wipe samples were only composed of cellulose-based fibres, whereas poly(propylene) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) were detected, along with cellulose, in the conventional wipes. The two techniques proved also effective in the detection of additives like benzoic acid/sodium benzoate, 2-phenoxyethanol, glycerine etc. SEM analysis allowed the discrimination between natural and regenerated cellulose fibres. The analytical protocol could be further developed to examine wet wipe degradation, the potential environmental effects of additives, and assess their impact in environmental samples.
