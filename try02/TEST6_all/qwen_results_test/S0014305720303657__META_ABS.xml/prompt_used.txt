You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Poly(ester amide)s from poly(alkylene succinate)s and rapid crystallizing amido diols: Synthesis, thermal properties and crystallization behavior Random poly(ester amide)s are synthesized from succinic acid, ethylene glycol or 1,4-butanediol and different aliphatic amido diols – symmetric α,ω-diols containing two amide moieties. The formation of chain-terminating N-succinimide end groups, which limit the molecular weight attainable by common synthetic strategies, is effectively suppressed. Poly(ester amide)s crystallize in a suprastructure similar to that of even-even polyamides. The thermal properties of both types of poly(ester amide)s synthesized are considerably improved and transition temperatures are tunable by changing the ratio of aliphatic diol to rapidly crystallizing amido diol in the feed. Using ethylene glycol as diol component, Tg and Tm of the material could be enhanced from −12 to −2 °C and 97 to 157 °C, respectively, while an increase from −33 to −8 °C and 115–153 °C was observed for their 1,4-butanediol derived counterparts. Furthermore, the slow crystallization rate of poly(ethylene succinate) from molten state could be significantly accelerated by the introduction of amide moieties into the polymer backbone.
