You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of hydrogen production and storage methods: fundamentals, advances, and SWOT analysis Hydrogen, as a versatile and clean energy carrier, holds immense potential to address the global challenges of climate change and energy security. It is estimated that hydrogen will be the main alternative to fossil fuels in the next 30 years. While hydrogen presents a promising solution for decarbonizing sectors such as transportation, industry, and power generation, realizing its full potential requires overcoming economic and environmental challenges. This review paper comprehensively examines various hydrogen production techniques, encompassing both conventional and emerging technologies, including renewable and non-renewable ones, ranging from conventional steam methane reforming to advanced electrolysis and renewable energy-driven pathways. In the other part, all of the hydrogen storage methods have been provided and compared to each other. The fundamentals, advantages, disadvantages, costs, and efficiencies of each production and storage method are scrutinized. The challenges are discussed, and solutions are evaluated. The SWOT analysis for hydrogen production and storage methods is provided, and the recent studies and published papers are summarized to make insights for more studies. Finally, based on the provided content, key challenges and future perspectives are drawn. This review serves as an invaluable reference for researchers, engineers, policymakers, and industry participants aiming to grasp the latest advancements in hydrogen production and storage technologies and how these innovations can hasten the journey towards a sustainable energy landscape.
