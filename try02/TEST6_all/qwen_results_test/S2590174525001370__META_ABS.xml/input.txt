A comprehensive review of hydrogen production and storage methods: fundamentals, advances, and SWOT analysis Hydrogen, as a versatile and clean energy carrier, holds immense potential to address the global challenges of climate change and energy security. It is estimated that hydrogen will be the main alternative to fossil fuels in the next 30 years. While hydrogen presents a promising solution for decarbonizing sectors such as transportation, industry, and power generation, realizing its full potential requires overcoming economic and environmental challenges. This review paper comprehensively examines various hydrogen production techniques, encompassing both conventional and emerging technologies, including renewable and non-renewable ones, ranging from conventional steam methane reforming to advanced electrolysis and renewable energy-driven pathways. In the other part, all of the hydrogen storage methods have been provided and compared to each other. The fundamentals, advantages, disadvantages, costs, and efficiencies of each production and storage method are scrutinized. The challenges are discussed, and solutions are evaluated. The SWOT analysis for hydrogen production and storage methods is provided, and the recent studies and published papers are summarized to make insights for more studies. Finally, based on the provided content, key challenges and future perspectives are drawn. This review serves as an invaluable reference for researchers, engineers, policymakers, and industry participants aiming to grasp the latest advancements in hydrogen production and storage technologies and how these innovations can hasten the journey towards a sustainable energy landscape.
