You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal activation of persulfates for organic wastewater purification: Heating modes, mechanism and influencing factors Thermal activation of persulfates (TAP) is a facile and easy-to-operate advanced oxidation technology for on-site decontamination of organic pollutants. Sulfate (SO4 •−) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) are the typical reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the processes of TAP. To date, numerous TAP systems have been developed to degrade recalcitrant contaminants in water. However, a comprehensive analysis of different thermal activation modes, particularly mechanisms and controlled generation of ROS, has not yet been reported. In this work, we present an overall review on different TAP systems. Specifically, diverse heating approaches such as thermal heating, microwave-induced heating and photothermal heating have different features in TAP and generate varying performances. Microwave heating for persulfate activation usually performs better than thermal heating at the same temperature, due to the intensified generation of radicals and boosted oxidation kinetics. Photothermal heating is cost-effective and eco-friendly via using sustainable solar energy. Moreover, the most appealing aspect of TAP is the promise of leveraging industrial waste heat to establish upscale integrated systems. Solution pH and background factors (e.g., anions and dissolved organic matters) have complicated impacts because of radical scavenging and the production of less reactive or reductive species. In addition, the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts can enhance the activity of TAP systems at low temperature, while the synergistic contribution of catalytic oxidation will be less significant at high reaction temperature. Finally, conclusions and challenges of TAP systems in actual water remediation are presented.
