You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent study of transition bimetallic catalyst in biomass tar steam reforming for hydrogen-rich syngas: A comprehensive bibliometric analysis An increase in the human population and the energy crisis have gained global attention in the search for alternative energy resources. Biomass energy has garnered significant attention as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate carbon footprints. The usage of biomass energy shows certain challenges and problems, such as tar formation. In order to understand this issue, a catalytic steam reforming of biomass tar has been carefully investigated. However, this process still faces several complications, such as catalyst deactivation, coke deposition, and other operational challenges, which require further research and improvement. This study employs a bibliometric analysis conducted from 1997 to 2024, pointing out keywords, nations, journals, inter-country co-authorship networks, and co-occurrence visualisations. The judgement was carried-out by utilising the Scopus database® and further demonstrated through R-Studio and VOSviewer. This inclusive literature review provides a thorough and up-to-date overview of the research on catalytic steam reforming of biomass tar. This question brings out the critical role of bimetallic catalysts and the need for continued invention in this field to address the global energy and environmental challenges.
