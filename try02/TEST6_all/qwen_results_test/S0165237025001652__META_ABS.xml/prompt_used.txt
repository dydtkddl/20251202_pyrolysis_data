You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of plastic waste via hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal gasification: Review and bibliometric analysis Plastic waste remains a pressing environmental issue, with conventional recycling methods falling short in efficiency. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) emerge as innovative approaches, transforming plastics like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and mixed municipal waste into valuable outputs such as bio-crude oil and syngas. These processes operate under subcritical water conditions (300–350°C) or supercritical water conditions (400–450°C), offering versatile solutions for waste management. This review synthesizes findings from 250 Scopus-indexed articles spanning 1998–2024, tracing the evolution of research from single-polymer studies to investigations of complex, real-world waste streams. Despite progress, challenges remain, including gaps in understanding reaction kinetics and barriers to industrial scalability. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for embedding hydrothermal technologies within the circular economy, enabling efficient resource recovery and pollution reduction. This article delivers a detailed bibliometric analysis and literature review, underscoring the promise of hydrothermal methods for sustainable plastic waste management.
