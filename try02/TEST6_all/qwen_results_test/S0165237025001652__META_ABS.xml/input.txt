Valorization of plastic waste via hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal gasification: Review and bibliometric analysis Plastic waste remains a pressing environmental issue, with conventional recycling methods falling short in efficiency. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) emerge as innovative approaches, transforming plastics like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and mixed municipal waste into valuable outputs such as bio-crude oil and syngas. These processes operate under subcritical water conditions (300–350°C) or supercritical water conditions (400–450°C), offering versatile solutions for waste management. This review synthesizes findings from 250 Scopus-indexed articles spanning 1998–2024, tracing the evolution of research from single-polymer studies to investigations of complex, real-world waste streams. Despite progress, challenges remain, including gaps in understanding reaction kinetics and barriers to industrial scalability. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for embedding hydrothermal technologies within the circular economy, enabling efficient resource recovery and pollution reduction. This article delivers a detailed bibliometric analysis and literature review, underscoring the promise of hydrothermal methods for sustainable plastic waste management.
