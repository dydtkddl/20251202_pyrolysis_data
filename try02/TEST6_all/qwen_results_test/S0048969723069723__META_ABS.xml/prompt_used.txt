You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic stepwise pyrolysis for dechlorination and chemical recycling of PVC-containing mixed plastic wastes: Influence of temperature, heating rate, and catalyst The viability of pyrolysis technology for chemical recycling of plastics is challenged by the presence of PVC in real-world mixed plastic wastes. This study aims to investigate catalytic stepwise pyrolysis as a pretreatment step to remove chlorine from PVC-containing plastic wastes prior to further processing. TG-FTIR and Py-GCMS analysis as well as experiments on a lab-scale pyrolysis system were conducted to study the influence of key processing parameters on the pretreatment including temperature, heating rate, and catalysts. Py-GCMS results indicated 300 °C to be the best pretreatment temperature in terms of balancing Cl removal and avoidance of organochloride formation. Metal oxides, i.e., CaO and Fe2O3, mainly acted as adsorbents of HCl gases with little cracking effect, and their adsorption effects are positively correlated with alkalinity. ZSM-5 catalysts promoted the release of HCl, and the dechlorination effect was more pronounced with ZSM-5 of higher acidity. In contrast, in the lab-scale pyrolysis system, 350 °C pretreatment achieved the highest HCl generation ratio, i.e., 43.60 %. The addition of zeolite catalyst significantly reduced the content of organochloride in the pyrolysis oil in contrast to the performance of metal oxides, but also absorbed most HCl instead of promoting HCl release as in Py-GCMS tests. Mass balance analyses revealed that the majority of chlorine was retained in the solid residues following the catalytic stepwise pyrolysis process, with the notable exception of Fe2O3. ZSM-5(25) catalyst combined with 350 °C pretreatment temperature and 550 °C final pyrolysis achieved the lowest chlorine content in the pyrolysis oil, i.e., 20 ppm, among different process conditions.
