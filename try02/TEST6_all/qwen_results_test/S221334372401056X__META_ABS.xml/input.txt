Plastic wastes (PWs) and microplastics (MPs) formation: Management, migration, and environmental impact Plastics are one of the essential human needs and their production expanded from 2.00 million tons (Mt) in 1950 to 459.75 Mt in 2019. However, its manufacture inevitably generates large amounts of plastic wastes (PWs), which are harmful to the environment and human health. In this review, the history of plastic development since the 1860s along with its production globally is summarized. Classification of plastics based on polymer types, production process, shape, sizes, and applications are reported. Strategies (including mechanical recycling, incineration, landfill, biodegradation, and pyrolysis) to manage PWs are stated. Environmental factors that break down PWs into microplastics (MPs) (10 years), which could contribute to MPs abundance. Physical, chemical, and biological actions are the main environmental factors that converted PWs to secondary MPs. MPs not only directly affect the growth and reproduction of aquatic and terrestrial animals, but also cause harm to the human lungs, kidneys, liver, blood, and cardiovascular systems. Hence, more researches are still required to fill the knowledge gaps on the influence of MPs in the ecosystem and develop potential approaches for the removal of MPs from all environments.
