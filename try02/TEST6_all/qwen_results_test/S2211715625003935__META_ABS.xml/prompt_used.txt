You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted 1-decene oligomerization: In-depth analysis, kinetic insights, and thermodynamic perspectives with HY zeolite catalyst Oligomerization of 1-olefins is a promising method for creating high-quality synthetic fuels and base oils. The optimization of 1-decene oligomerization was conducted in a micro-wave-assisted batch reactor using HY-zeolite as a catalyst. The Box-Behnken design, a response surface methodology, was employed to optimize the reaction by varying catalyst dose (0.02–0.15 g), reaction time (5–60 min), and temperature (100–250 °C). A quadratic regression model with an R2 value above 91 % indicated a strong correlation between experimental and predicted data. The study revealed that higher temperatures and catalyst doses enhanced conversion, while extended reaction time initially boosted conversion but later caused a decline. Temperature and catalyst dose were identified as the most significant factors, while time had a statistically insignificant effect. The maximum conversion was obtained at optimal conditions of 175 °C, 30 min, and 0.11 g of catalyst. Product analysis using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) confirmed the formation of oligomers, with FTIR showing the disappearance of monomeric double bonds and GPC confirming oligomers with a molecular weight of approximately 700 g/mol. The kinetic study revealed an activation energy of 13.4 kJ/mol, and a reaction order of 1. The oligomerization process was determined to be endothermic, with positive adsorption enthalpy values for both dimerization and trimerization reactions.
