You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ionothermal synthesis and electrochemical analysis of Fe doped LiMnPO4/C composites as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries Shuttle shaped and Fe doped LiMnPO4 particles are successfully synthesized via an ionothermal routine in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [EMIM]OTf and 1-buty-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [BMIM]OTf at 260°C, respectively. And then, the carbon coated product of cathode materials can be efficiently prepared by a subsequent short calcination process. Scanning electron microscopy and field emission transmission electron microscopy shows that these as-prepared particles with the mean width of about 200nm and length of 800nm were coated by uniform carbon layers, which could improve the electronic conductivity of the final product effectively. The D Li values of samples that prepared in two ionic liquids above were calculated to be 1.36×10−13 and 4.61×10−14 cm2 s−1, respectively. It can be attributed to the LiMn0.95Fe0.05PO4/C particles prepared in [BMIM]OTf present more uniform distribution and smaller size. Thus, it deliver high discharge capacities of 159.2, 146.0, 135.1, 125.3, 115.5 and 84.4mAhg−1 in the voltage range of 2.5–4.5V at charge–discharge rate of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C, respectively.
