Co-pyrolysis of petroleum based waste HDPE, poly-lactic-acid biopolymer and organic waste Waste pyrolysis is widely investigated, but less information is available about their co-pyrolysis. The present paper discloses the waste pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis in batch reactor at 400°C, 450°C and 500°C. The effect of the raw materials and temperature to the product was investigated. Product yield was increased and the quality (composition, contaminants, etc.) improved by co-pyrolysis. Gas and pyrolysis oil yields increased as function of temperature. Higher ratio of organic waste/petroleum based plastic waste resulted in lower yields of volatile hydrocarbons. Concentrations of oxygen containing products and contaminants are significantly changed with temperature or adding of HDPE into raw materials.
