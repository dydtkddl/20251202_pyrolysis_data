Kinetics of isocyanuric acid pyrolysis The kinetics of isocyanuric acid pyrolysis are determined in a tubular continuous flow reactor under atmospheric pressure, for temperatures ranging from 698 to 798 K and with residence times from 1 to 73 s. The main product of the pyrolysis is isocyanic acid (HNCO), a monomer of isocyanuric acid. Isocyanic acid itself decomposes into different products. With correct choice of temperature and residence times, the yield of isocyanic acid reaches 85%. The Arrhenius parameters derived are compared with literature data.
