You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric and kinetic study of thermal degradation of various types of municipal solid waste (MSW) under N2, CO2 and oxy-fuel conditions Oxy-fuel combustion is one carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technique that uses both O2 and recirculated flue gas as an oxidiser. As a result, the produced gas is composed mainly of CO2 and H2O, which makes its sequestration more cost-effective. Changing the atmosphere from N2 to CO2 affects combustion behaviour. To study the impact of the atmosphere on the combustion process, the thermal degradation of representative types of municipal solid waste (MSW) under N2, CO2, and O2/CO2 atmospheres was analysed using a thermogravimetric (TG) instrument. Nonisothermal degradation experiments were conducted, and three heating rates were examined. Isoconversional methods were employed to determine kinetic data. Comparing N2 and CO2 atmospheres, it was found that below 600 °C, the shape of TG curves was not affected significantly. However, above 600 °C under CO2 atmosphere, a second peak appeared, which indicated gasification reactions of the char with carbon dioxide. In the presence of oxygen, the second peak was shifted to lower temperatures, indicating that thermal decomposition with O2 was more rapid. The reported kinetic parameters provide fundamental information on the conversion of solid waste. Thus, they are essential for designing chambers dedicated to the oxy-combustion of waste.
