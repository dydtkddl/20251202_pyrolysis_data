You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Torrefaction of combustible construction and demolition waste: Evolution of fuel performance, heavy metal migration and combustion characteristics Combustible construction solid wastes (CSW) derived from construction and demolition (C&D) wastes is an important part for waste-to-energy system. Torrefaction experiment of five CSW components involving plastic (PL), wood (WD), textile (TX), paper and board (PB), and rubber (RB) were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at torrefaction temperature of 200–400 °C and holding time of 30 min. Fuel properties and heavy metal migration of CSW components via torrefaction are characterized by proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, caloric value determination, and the determination of heavy metal contents in solid, liquid and gas products. Combustion characteristics of CSW components and their torrefied solid products were evaluated by TG-FTIR method. The obtained results indicated that torrefaction has a significant influence on volatile matter, fixed carbon, calorific value, and H/C and O/C molar ratios of CSW components. The ash content in high ash CSW components increases and energy yield decreases significantly when torrefaction temperature is larger than 250 °C. Heavy metals of Zn, Pb, Cu and Mn in CSW components is partly migrated into the liquid products, but Hg and As are almost entirely present in the liquid products at different torrefaction temperatures. The combustible index and burnout index of PL, WD, PB and RB decrease gradually when torrefaction temperature is more than 250 °C, and the lower yields of SO2, NO, HCl, CH4 and CO of torrefied CSW are achieved at torrefaction temperature of 250 °C. The optimum torrefaction temperature of 250 °C is proposed for improving fuel properties, heavy metal migration and combustion characteristics of CSW components.
