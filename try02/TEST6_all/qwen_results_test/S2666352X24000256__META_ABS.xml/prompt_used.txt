You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enabling plastic waste gasification by autothermal chemical looping with > 90 % syngas purity for versatile feedstock handling The chemical looping gasification of plastics (CLGP) is a process that offers an innovative solution for transforming post-consumer waste plastics into high-value products. The process utilizes a co-current moving bed reducer reactor with iron-titanium-based oxygen carriers to gasify plastic feed and generate syngas autothermally. Its distinguishing feature is its ability to operate over a wide range of feed loadings and co-injection of mixed plastic species without any performance losses. Isothermal bench-scale experiments reveal a syngas purity of ∼95 %, aligning with the thermodynamic simulations. The moving bed reactor facilitates a deeper reduction of the oxygen carriers to the Fe+FeTiO3 phase, leading to the high syngas purity, which is then verified with additional TGA, XRD, and SEM analysis. For an autothermal operation of CLGP process, an active material content of 20 % is found to be sufficient to satisfy the kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. Further integration with downstream production of H2 is presented and compared to a steam gasification process. The process integration simulations show that the CLGP process outperforms the steam gasification system in terms of Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE), Effective Thermal Efficiency (ETE), and H2 yield. CO2 emissions are impressively reduced by ∼30 % in the CLGP system over that in the steam gasification system due to its ability to autothermally operate the process, unlike the highly endothermic steam gasification process.
