Enabling plastic waste gasification by autothermal chemical looping with > 90 % syngas purity for versatile feedstock handling The chemical looping gasification of plastics (CLGP) is a process that offers an innovative solution for transforming post-consumer waste plastics into high-value products. The process utilizes a co-current moving bed reducer reactor with iron-titanium-based oxygen carriers to gasify plastic feed and generate syngas autothermally. Its distinguishing feature is its ability to operate over a wide range of feed loadings and co-injection of mixed plastic species without any performance losses. Isothermal bench-scale experiments reveal a syngas purity of ∼95 %, aligning with the thermodynamic simulations. The moving bed reactor facilitates a deeper reduction of the oxygen carriers to the Fe+FeTiO3 phase, leading to the high syngas purity, which is then verified with additional TGA, XRD, and SEM analysis. For an autothermal operation of CLGP process, an active material content of 20 % is found to be sufficient to satisfy the kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. Further integration with downstream production of H2 is presented and compared to a steam gasification process. The process integration simulations show that the CLGP process outperforms the steam gasification system in terms of Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE), Effective Thermal Efficiency (ETE), and H2 yield. CO2 emissions are impressively reduced by ∼30 % in the CLGP system over that in the steam gasification system due to its ability to autothermally operate the process, unlike the highly endothermic steam gasification process.
