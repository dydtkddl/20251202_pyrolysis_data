You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing hydrocarbon yield from co-pyrolysis of Agave sisalana bagasse and multilayer plastic film wastes for sustainable fuel production using simplex-centroid mixture design and principal component analysis The production of alternative fuels to replace fossil-derived products constitutes a significant research topic, given the need for sustainable solutions that support energy transition and decarbonization of the transport sector. In this context, this pioneering study investigates the co-pyrolysis of Agave sisalana (sisal) bagasse with two types of multilayer plastic waste: polyethylene film with an aluminum barrier (PFA) and polyethylene film with an ethylene-vinyl alcohol barrier (PFE). The experiments were conducted in a micro-pyrolyzer coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), using a simplex centroid mixture design to optimize compositions and principal component analysis (PCA) to interpret the data. While the isolated pyrolysis of sisal bagasse resulted in 58.78 % oxygenated compounds, co-pyrolysis with 50 % PFA provided a maximum yield of 91.39 % aliphatic hydrocarbons, representing a 2.97-fold increase compared to the pyrolysis of the isolated residue. PFA demonstrated a superior synergistic effect to PFE when combined with sisal bagasse. The results indicate that this combination can produce hydrocarbon-rich pyrolytic oil, significantly contributing to sustainable waste management and advancing the “waste-to-energy” concept by converting residual materials into alternative transportation fuels.
