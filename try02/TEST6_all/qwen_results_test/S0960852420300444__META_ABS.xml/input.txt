Effective deoxygenation for the production of liquid biofuels via microwave assisted co-pyrolysis of agro residues and waste plastics combined with catalytic upgradation Rice straw and sugarcane bagasse were co-pyrolyzed with polypropylene and polystyrene using microwaves, and the pyrolysis vapors were catalytically upgraded using HZSM-5 catalyst. The product yields, composition and properties of bio-oil from pyrolysis of individual feedstocks and equal composition mixtures before and after catalytic upgradation were thoroughly investigated. The pyrolysis oil yields from polypropylene (82 wt%) and polystyrene (98 wt%) were high compared to that from rice straw (26 wt%) and bagasse (29 wt%). Catalytic upgradation at weight hourly space velocity of 11 h−1 resulted in higher selectivity to unsaturated aliphatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Properties of upgraded bio-oil from biomass-polypropylene mixtures were similar to that of light fuel oil with high calorific value (43 MJ/kg), low viscosity (1 cP), optimum density (0.850 g/cm3) and flash point (70 °C). Oxygen content in catalytically upgraded co-pyrolysis bio-oil was low (<5%) as compared to upgraded pyrolysis bio-oil (14–18%), and pyrolysis bio-oil without upgradation (20–24%).
