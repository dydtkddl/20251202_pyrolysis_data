You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective deoxygenation for the production of liquid biofuels via microwave assisted co-pyrolysis of agro residues and waste plastics combined with catalytic upgradation Rice straw and sugarcane bagasse were co-pyrolyzed with polypropylene and polystyrene using microwaves, and the pyrolysis vapors were catalytically upgraded using HZSM-5 catalyst. The product yields, composition and properties of bio-oil from pyrolysis of individual feedstocks and equal composition mixtures before and after catalytic upgradation were thoroughly investigated. The pyrolysis oil yields from polypropylene (82 wt%) and polystyrene (98 wt%) were high compared to that from rice straw (26 wt%) and bagasse (29 wt%). Catalytic upgradation at weight hourly space velocity of 11 h−1 resulted in higher selectivity to unsaturated aliphatics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Properties of upgraded bio-oil from biomass-polypropylene mixtures were similar to that of light fuel oil with high calorific value (43 MJ/kg), low viscosity (1 cP), optimum density (0.850 g/cm3) and flash point (70 °C). Oxygen content in catalytically upgraded co-pyrolysis bio-oil was low (<5%) as compared to upgraded pyrolysis bio-oil (14–18%), and pyrolysis bio-oil without upgradation (20–24%).
