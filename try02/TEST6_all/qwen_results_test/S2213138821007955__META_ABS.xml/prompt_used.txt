You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave co-pyrolysis of PET bottle waste and rice husk: effect of plastic waste loading on product formation This research work is focused to understand the role of microwave susceptor-assisted pyrolysis on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle waste with rice husk (RH) valorization. Microwave pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted at 450 W microwave power using a graphite susceptor. Effects of PET: RH ratio and total mass of co-pyrolysis feed mixture were thoroughly investigated. Mass and energy yields of bio-crude, char, and gas were evaluated. Microwave energy consumption and energy efficiency of pyrolysis were also evaluated. Pyrolysis energy efficiency is higher at 40 g (73–76%) compared to 20 g (53–75%) of co-pyrolysis feed mixture. The heating value of bio-crude was high (34–36 MJ/kg) due to carbon (79–83 wt%) and hydrogen (5–6 wt%) rich compounds. Bio-crude composition significantly varied with PET: RH ratios. Co-pyrolysis promoted the formation of aromatic oxygenates and biphenyl hydrocarbons. The selectivity of biphenyl hydrocarbons (29.2%) is high at an equal PET: RH ratio. The selectivity of hydrocarbons obtained at the 20:20 (PET: RH) ratio is found to be 47.5%. The selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons obtained in microwave pyrolysis (47.9%) of PET is higher compared to conventional pyrolysis (8%). In microwave pyrolysis of RH, the high selectivity of aromatic oxygenates (73%) was obtained. Whereas, in conventional pyrolysis, the formation of aliphatic oxygenates (36.5%) was observed. This research would provide an understanding of waste valorization using the co-pyrolysis platform.
