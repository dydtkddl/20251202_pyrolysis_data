You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing sustainable hybrid bitumen systems: A compatibilization solution by functionalized polyolefins for enhanced crumb rubber content in bitumen Polymer waste pollution has a profound effect on the environment and, consequently, on the lifestyle of humankind. The massive production and disposal of cross-linked polymers clearly exemplify the challenges of recycling. Increasing efforts are being undertaken to introduce recycled polymers, especially crumb rubber (CR), into asphalt formulations. Due to the rather poor processability and phase separation associated with CR-modified bitumen (CRMB) compositions, a broader implementation of such concept is challenging unless an efficient compatibilizer is applied. Results from the study on usage of In-Reactor-Functionalized Polyolefins viz. poly(propylene-co-hex-1-ene-co-hex-5-en-1-ol) (FPP), demonstrated excellent compatibilizing ability in CRMB, allowing incorporation of up to 10 wt% of CR. This represents a significant improvement when compared to the best-in-class solutions. The FPP-containing products exhibit superior bulk, nanomechanical and rheological properties, as well as stability during binder annealing. Furthermore, the bitumen surface morphology is significantly improved. The polar groups present in the FPP create a thermo-reversible interpenetrating cross-linked network that provides mechanical integrity and contributes to the adhesion to different components of the modified bitumen at service temperatures, enhancing its processability. The exceptional compatibility of FPP in CRMB resulted in a significant increase in the Performance Grade of the hybrid system by 5 classes (88) compared to neat bitumen (58). Moreover, the best-performing composition fulfilled the low-temperature ductility specifications, withstanding deformation without fracturing or breaking up to a 400 mm elongation.
