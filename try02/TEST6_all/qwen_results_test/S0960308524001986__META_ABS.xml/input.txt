Technical-economic assessment of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural production via catalytic hydrothermal synthesis from lignocellulosic forest residues The 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is a high-value chemical that can be used as a raw material for the synthesis of biofuels and bioplastics. The use of forest woody residues as a source of biomass reduces the costs and environmental impacts associated with the process. The objective of this study was to optimize the conditions of catalytic hydrothermal synthesis of 5-HMF from the residue of three biomasses, and to carry out a technical-economic assessment of the feasibility of the process on an industrial scale. The materials used were forest woody residues, distilled water, acetic acid (CH3COOH), and niobium oxide (Nb2O5) as a reaction catalyst.The identification and quantification of the 5-HMF yield was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For the technical-economic assessment, the CAPCOST Estimation Software® was used, which allows estimating the capital and operation costs, as well as the financial indicators of the project. Under optimized conditions, the maximum yield of 5-HMF was 32.6 %, based on dry mass (bdm). The technical-economic assessment (TEA) indicated that the project is economically viable, considering a selling price of 5-HMF of 2.16 dollars/kg. The main financial indicators were CAPEX of 197.83 million dollars, OPEX of 99.78 million dollars, net present value (NPV) of 197.83 million dollars, internal rate of return (IRR) of 44 %, and the payback time of 2.25 years.
