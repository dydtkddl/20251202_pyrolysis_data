You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Technical-economic assessment of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural production via catalytic hydrothermal synthesis from lignocellulosic forest residues The 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is a high-value chemical that can be used as a raw material for the synthesis of biofuels and bioplastics. The use of forest woody residues as a source of biomass reduces the costs and environmental impacts associated with the process. The objective of this study was to optimize the conditions of catalytic hydrothermal synthesis of 5-HMF from the residue of three biomasses, and to carry out a technical-economic assessment of the feasibility of the process on an industrial scale. The materials used were forest woody residues, distilled water, acetic acid (CH3COOH), and niobium oxide (Nb2O5) as a reaction catalyst.The identification and quantification of the 5-HMF yield was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). For the technical-economic assessment, the CAPCOST Estimation Software® was used, which allows estimating the capital and operation costs, as well as the financial indicators of the project. Under optimized conditions, the maximum yield of 5-HMF was 32.6 %, based on dry mass (bdm). The technical-economic assessment (TEA) indicated that the project is economically viable, considering a selling price of 5-HMF of 2.16 dollars/kg. The main financial indicators were CAPEX of 197.83 million dollars, OPEX of 99.78 million dollars, net present value (NPV) of 197.83 million dollars, internal rate of return (IRR) of 44 %, and the payback time of 2.25 years.
