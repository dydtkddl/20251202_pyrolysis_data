You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metabolic engineering of Yarrowia lipolytica for poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most widely used plastic, whose global production scale causes serious problems due to it being highly non-biodegradable. The present work provides a novel approach to plastic degradation studies, which involves direct degradation of PET in the culture of a modified Y. lipolytica yeast strain extracellularly producing cutinase from Fusarium solani. In this study, we successfully accomplished a scale-up of the degradation process in culture, which is promising from the perspective of wider application of the developed method in the future. Additionally, we tested the effect of various supplements, which may increase the PET degradation efficiency in the culture of the Y. lipolytica pAD CUT_FS strain. The ability of PET decomposition was verified by the amount of the released degradation products, such as terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalic acid (MHET), during cultivation. We observed that the quantities of TPA and MHET released during the PET degradation process were increasing daily, and were 1.51 gL−1 and 0.45 gL−1, respectively after 240 h of the bioreactor fermentation. Analysis of the PET film by electron microscopy indicated that there was abundant damage on the surface of the material. This study also demonstrated that the engineered Y. lipolytica strain is able to degrade PET at 28 °C during fermentation. The results obtained in this study using amorphous PET powder provide a wide range of possibilities for application of the cutinase-secreting strain of Y. lipolytica on the more difficult to degrade highly crystalline PET films, PET bottles and PET melts.
