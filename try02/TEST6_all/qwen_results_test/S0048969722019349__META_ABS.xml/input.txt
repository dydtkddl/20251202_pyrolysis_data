Metabolic engineering of Yarrowia lipolytica for poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most widely used plastic, whose global production scale causes serious problems due to it being highly non-biodegradable. The present work provides a novel approach to plastic degradation studies, which involves direct degradation of PET in the culture of a modified Y. lipolytica yeast strain extracellularly producing cutinase from Fusarium solani. In this study, we successfully accomplished a scale-up of the degradation process in culture, which is promising from the perspective of wider application of the developed method in the future. Additionally, we tested the effect of various supplements, which may increase the PET degradation efficiency in the culture of the Y. lipolytica pAD CUT_FS strain. The ability of PET decomposition was verified by the amount of the released degradation products, such as terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalic acid (MHET), during cultivation. We observed that the quantities of TPA and MHET released during the PET degradation process were increasing daily, and were 1.51 gL−1 and 0.45 gL−1, respectively after 240 h of the bioreactor fermentation. Analysis of the PET film by electron microscopy indicated that there was abundant damage on the surface of the material. This study also demonstrated that the engineered Y. lipolytica strain is able to degrade PET at 28 °C during fermentation. The results obtained in this study using amorphous PET powder provide a wide range of possibilities for application of the cutinase-secreting strain of Y. lipolytica on the more difficult to degrade highly crystalline PET films, PET bottles and PET melts.
