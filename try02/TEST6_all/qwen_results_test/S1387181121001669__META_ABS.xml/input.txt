Current approaches and methodologies to explore the perceptive adsorption mechanism of dyes on low-cost agricultural waste: A review Discharging of dyes containing effluents into water bodies has severely affected various forms of life because of their carcinogenic nature. Many conventional methods have been failed to treat the dyes contaminated water due to their less effectivity or economically not feasible. Among different techniques, adsorption is gaining importance in pollutant management due to its low operating cost, universal nature, and ease of operation. This review article highlights the feasibility of agricultural waste material in its natural and modified form as a low-cost adsorbent for the treatment of dyes and the preparation of the activated carbon (AC) and their dye adsorption characteristics. This review paper also illustrates the effectiveness of operational parameters, kinetics, and isotherm models to understand the adsorbent behavior and adsorption mechanism. The importance of response surface methodology (RSM) programmed in optimizing the adsorption process to remove dyes was also discussed. Moreover, the discussion on challenges and prospects about adsorption technology for future research such as exploitation of agricultural wastes on a commercial scale, building economy incentive standards, designing the methodologies, and eco-friendly ways to recycle the wastes were proposed.
