You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modification of Eucalyptus and Spruce organosolv lignins with fatty acids to use as filler in PLA Spruce (softwood) and Eucalyptus (hardwood) woods were used as raw material for lignin extraction by organosolv process. Chemical, structural and thermal characterizations of the extracted lignin samples have been performed using HPLC, GPC, FT-IR, 31P NMR, 13C NMR, DSC and TGA. Both lignins showed high purity, being Spruce lignin (OS) which presented the highest Klason lignin content (93%) and lowest sugar (0.5%) and sulphur (0.04%) content. Extracted lignin samples were chemically modified with dodecanoyl chloride fatty acid, in order to modify its thermal properties as glass transition temperature (Tg). The noticeable increase in the molecular weight and sharp decrease of Tg can be appreciated. Esterified lignins were used as filler in poly(lactic acid) (PLA) films elaborated by solvent casting in different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50%). Mechanical, thermal and water barrier properties of prepared films were investigated. The results showed that the addition of both modified lignins contributed to greater ductility and lower stiffness, providing plasticity to PLA.
