Synthetic routes to nanoscale B x C y N z architectures B x C y N z nanoscale materials, hybrids of h-BN and graphite, have been recently synthesised using various techniques. Here, we present the latest advances in the synthesis and characterisation of B–C–N nanotubes and nanofibres. In particular, we focus on layered BC2N, BN, BC and CN x systems, reviewing their production methods as well as their structural and electronic properties. These materials may find important applications in the fabrication of nanotransistors, robust nanocomposites, conducting polymers, storage components and field emission sources.
