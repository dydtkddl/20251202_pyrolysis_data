You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State and future implementation perspectives of porous carbon-based hybridized matrices for lithium sulfur battery Recent notable progress in the lithium sulfur batteries (LiSBs) indicates the development of a futuristic mature energy storage system which has the potential of replacing the existing commercial batteries. Backed with the advantages of exceptional theoretical energy density, comparatively lower production cost, cheaper and environmentally benign abundant raw materials, the LiSBs have shown the utmost potential to defeat counterpart battery systems currently in the race of rechargeable energy devices. Despite of displaying extraordinary features, the LiSBs suffers from the non-conductivity of sulfur, shuttle effect caused by dissolution of polysulfides, volumetric changes in sulfur during charging/discharging, and dendrites formation at anode, which altogether causes capacity decay and poor battery lifespans. During the last decade, rigorous and innovative engineering designs in developing sulfur host materials have been considered to effectively overcome the drawbacks with LiSBs and utilize their full potential. This review specifically focuses on the porous carbon-based matrix materials which have been used for hosting sulfur cathodes. A detailed overview of structural merits of host materials and their detailed mechanism of interaction with sulfur along with key strategies of designing high performance cathodes for LiSBs is conferred in detail. Lastly, the major challenges and prospects for developing LiSBs technologies with superior energy density in combination with long cycle life for next generation electric vehicles are presented.
