You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Product distribution modelling in the thermal pyrolysis of high density polyethylene The thermal fast pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor in the 450–715°C range, and individual products have been monitored with the aim of obtaining kinetic data for the design and simulation of this process at large scale. Kinetic schemes have been proposed in order to explain both the results obtained in the laboratory plant and those obtained in the literature by other authors operating at laboratory and larger scale. Discrimination has been carried out based on the contribution of the variance of model parameters (stepwise regression) to the total variance explained by the model. The models based on that of Westerhout et al. [R.W.J. Westerhout, J. Waanders, W.P.M. Van Swaaij, Recycling of polyethene and polypropene in a novel bench-scale rotating cone reactor by high-temperature pyrolysis. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 37 (6) (1998) 2293–2300] do not adequately predict the experimental results, especially those corresponding to aromatics and char, which is probably due to the very short residence times attained in the conical spouted bed and, consequently, to the lower yields of aromatics and char. The model of best fit is the one where polyethylene degrades to give gas, liquid (oil) and wax fractions. Furthermore, the latter undergoes secondary reactions to give liquid and aromatics, which in turn produce more char.
