You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interfacial engineering of 0D–2D hierarchical MXene@PEI@AgNC nanohybrids to achieve flame retardant, mechanical and antibacterial properties of ABS nanocomposites It is an intractable challenge that the hierarchical MXene-based nanohybrid fillers are intended to modify the inherent flammability and easily breeding bacteria property of ABS polymeric materials, thereby facilitating wide applicability of ABS composites. Here, an interface engineering strategy was proposed, wherein polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified silver nanocubes (AgNCs) was firmly assembled on MXenes via electrostatic interaction to construct 0D–2D hierarchical MXene-based nanohybrids (MXene@PEI@AgNC). The MXene was protected and the interface compatibility between MXene-based nanohybrid and ABS matrix was enhanced. Results revealed that the unique hierarchical structure of the composite promoted enhanced dispersion of MXene@PEI@AgNC in the ABS matrix. Combustion tests showed that 1.0 wt%MXene@PEI@AgNC provided the ABS with effective fire safety. Moreover, ABS-1.0 wt%MXene@PEI@AgNC exhibited a 31.88 % decrease in peak heat release rate, a 39.60 % decrease in peak smoke release rate, a 41.50 % decrease in peak CO2 production rate, and a 50.04 % reduction in the smoke factor. Meanwhile, 1.0 wt%MXene@PEI@AgNC improved the tensile strength of ABS-1.0 %MXene@PEI@AgNC (+18.1 %) without reducing the elongation at break. They also enhanced the antibacterial properties of ABS-1.0 %MXene@PEI@AgNC. This study proposed a novel and feasible approach to address the interfacial stability of MXene and to construct MXene-based hierarchical nanoblends, thereby facilitating the wide practical applications of polymeric nanomaterials in industry.
