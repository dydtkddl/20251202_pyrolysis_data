You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and organic acids generation by ball milling and batch incubation of sedimentary rocks Pulverized rock samples are widely used in laboratory experiments, e.g., to assess microbial or abiotic processes in batch incubation tests. However, it is unclear if ball-milled samples accurately reflect in-situ conditions and if observed processes are affected by by-products artificially generated during the sample preparation procedure. As such, this study examined the effects of dry ball milling on the release of gases, which include C1–C4 hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) from different sedimentary rocks. The experiments involved pulverization using a gas-tight zirconium oxide planetary ball mill followed by wet and dry batch incubation and thermal desorption up to 200 °C. During milling, all sedimentary rocks, except a low organic carbon sandstone, yielded methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), H2, CO2, and unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g., ethene (C2H4). Sandstones only yielded H2, CH4, and CO2. Stable carbon isotope signatures of these products are similar to thermogenic gases. The gases were also detected in subsequent wet incubation experiments (after gases from milling had been removed). Additionally, formate, acetate, and citrate, were detected in all samples except for sandstone. Pyruvate, malate, and succinate were also detected in some samples. Thermal desorption products of powdered limestone, shale, and pyrite concretion samples included organic acids, such as acetate and formate, which were found at higher levels in milled samples than in crushed particles (1 mm). The original geological thermal maturity of the studied sedimentary rock samples was low (below “oil window”) and, thus, considerably below “gas window,” suggesting that most of the detected gases were generated during ball milling. H2 generated during ball milling may be derived from the reduction of water from fluid inclusion or phyllosilicates, involving the formation of reactive mineral surfaces or radicals. Notably, the concentrations of gaseous hydrocarbons derived from milling are relatively high and comparable to “wet” gases. At the same time, these data indicate that substantial amounts of gases and LWMOAs might be artificially generated during laboratory batch experiments with milled samples. Hence, ball milled rock samples must be used with caution if assessing (bio-)geochemical processes for natural environments.
