You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal activated-acid/alkali modified kaolin for enhanced heavy metals capture during high-organic solid waste pyrolysis: Experimental and theoretical comparative study The mandated waste classification poses challenges for the eco-friendly disposal of combustible high-organic solid waste (HSW), characterized by elevated heavy metal content and a low ash proportion. Fortunately, pyrolysis technology for HSW is emerging as a promising direction for achieving waste-to-resource conversion. To further mitigate secondary pollution, thermal activated-acid modified kaolin (H-kaolin) and thermal activated-alkali modified kaolin (OH-kaolin) were separately prepared, and their enhanced effects of immobilization and stabilization on heavy metals during pyrolysis were contrastively explored. Characterization results demonstrated that dehydroxy-dealuminization and zeolite NaA formation were intrinsic reasons for improvements in physical properties (specific surface area, pore volume) of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively. Experimental results revealed that H-kaolin outperformed OH-kaolin, showcasing its potential as a high-performance in-furnace adsorbent. Compared with other natural mineral-based sorbents reported in the literature, H-kaolin exhibited leading levels of immobilization, stabilization, and adsorption efficiency for heavy metals. Theoretical calculations illustrated that AlIII-O generated via dealuminization and SiIII-O in zeolite NaA were the main adsorption sites of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively, correspondingly binding with heavy metals to form oxides and silicates. The differences in active sites, electron transfer directions and bonding types during adsorption of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin were the intrinsic reasons for their distinct adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, derived chars with H-kaolin were deemed safe for application in pollutant adsorption in industrial field and soil improvement in gardens or parks. This research presented new ideas for developing high-performance in-furnace sorbents during pyrolysis, and explored the feasible safety application fields for pyrolytic derived-char.
