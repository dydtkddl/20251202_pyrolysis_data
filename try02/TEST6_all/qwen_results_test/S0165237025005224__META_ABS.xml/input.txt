Comparative study of thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene at moderate temperatures. Effects of vacuum and the molecular weight of polystyrene on the selectivities of styrene and other aromatic products This work evaluates the effect of the molecular weight of the polystyrene (PS) feedstock on the styrene selectivity of a thermal PS pyrolysis process at moderate temperatures (≤450 °C) developed at our lab. Also, acid and basic thermal catalytic pyrolysis were compared with the mentioned thermal process. These experiments were carried out under positive pressure using commercial PS as feedstock; but a thermal pyrolysis process under vacuum conditions was also tested, exhibiting increases in monomer yield from 19 % to 48 % (area-based). The polystyrene molar mass strongly influenced the monomer yield in thermal pyrolysis experiments. Catalytic experiments were carried out using commercial zeolites like ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony Mobil – 5) and zeolites-HY (hydrogen form of zeolite type Y) as acid catalysts. For basic catalytic experiments, calcium oxide (CaO) was used in pure (in-situ) and supported in fumed silica (CaO/SiO2) (ex-situ) forms. The styrene yields (area-based) for the zeolite-catalyzed pyrolysis were in the range of 12–13.4 %, while for the CaO in-situ was 25 % and for the CaO/SiO2, 18 %. The selectivity of styrene and other aromatic byproducts as isomers of monoaromatics, dimers and trimers among the different pyrolysis processes is also compared. All the obtained pyrolysis products in the liquid fraction were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and the main compounds were identified. The pyrolysis type (catalytic/thermal) had a profound effect on the product selectivity. The vacuum process led to a significant increase in monomer yield at a moderate temperature (400 °C), that allows for a pyrolysis process with relatively low energy consumption.
