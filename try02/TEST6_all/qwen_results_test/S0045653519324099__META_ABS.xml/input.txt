An overview of microplastics characterization by thermal analysis Microplastics may be present in the environment as primary microplastics (manufactured) or secondary microplastics (result of the continuous degradation of larger plastic pieces into smaller fragments due to environmental, physicochemical and biotic factors). To fully understand the dynamics of microplastic particles and their environmental effects, harmonized, automated, cheap, rapid and reliable methodologies for sampling, extraction and characterization of microplastic need to be developed. This review focuses on the potential of thermal analytical techniques for microplastics characterization and highlights some of the new trends in this area.
