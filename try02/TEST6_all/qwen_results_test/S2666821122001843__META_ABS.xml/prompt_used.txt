You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanomaterial production using waste plastic pyrolysis over a new catalyst made from mining residues: Effect of plastic type Pyrolysis and in-line catalytic decomposition of plastic waste were performed for the production of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) and hydrogen. A new catalyst, Ni-UGSO (Nickel-UpGraded Slug Oxide), was used in a continuous mode, and its activity was compared to that of a typical Fe/Al2O3 catalytic formulation. Moreover, the pyrolysis-catalysis of different plastics (virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE), used HDPE, and mixed plastics) was studied to investigate the effect of the plastic type on the quantity and quality of the produced CNMs. Ni-UGSO exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the production of CNMs and H2 of the two formulations tested, with yields of 56.6 kg/100 kgplastic and 13.2 kmol/100 kgplastic, respectively. The high activity and performance of Ni-UGSO were attributed to the synergistic effect of the Ni and Fe in Ni-UGSO. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results revealed that most of the produced carbon was in the form of carbon nanofilaments (CNFs) of different diameters, ranging from 8 to 90 nm. The use of mixed plastics as a feedstock decreased the yield of CNMs by 10 wt%, and a layer of amorphous carbon covered the CNFs. This layer is due to the presence of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and other contaminants in the feedstock. Raman spectroscopy showed that the CNFs produced from used HDPE had the highest intensity ratio G/D (1.13).
