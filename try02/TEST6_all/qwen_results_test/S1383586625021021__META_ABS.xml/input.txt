Preparation of ultra-microporous oxygen-enriched carbon from activating waste sawdust with potassium formate for selective adsorption of CO2/CH4 Rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are primarily triggered by global warming, and the creation of efficient and sustainable methods for capturing carbon is essential to mitigating and combating global climate change. In this study, wood-based ultra-microporous oxygen-enriched carbon materials were prepared by pyrolysis using sawdust from agroforestry biowaste as a carbon source and the green activator HCOOK. The results showed that sample ACK1-800 exhibited substantial adsorption capacity (6.56 mmol/g, 3.06 mmol/g at 273 K and 100 kPa, respectively) and favorable selectivity towards (186 for CO2/N2 and 26 for CH4/N2) for CO2 and CH4. Meanwhile, the material exhibited a modes energy of adsorption (36.6 kJ/ mol for CO2 and 29.3 kJ/ mol for CH4) and stable cycling properties, indicating that the adsorption process involves typical physisorption. In addition, linear correlations of CO2 and CH4 adsorption behaviors were constructed, emphasizing that the volume of ultra-micropores and oxygen functional groups is closely linked to how well the material can absorb things. In conclusion, this study proposes a method of preparing high-performance ACKX-T materials, which realizes the high-value utilization of waste sawdust and provides a new idea for developing new green activators.
