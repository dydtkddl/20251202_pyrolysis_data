You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of ultra-microporous oxygen-enriched carbon from activating waste sawdust with potassium formate for selective adsorption of CO2/CH4 Rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are primarily triggered by global warming, and the creation of efficient and sustainable methods for capturing carbon is essential to mitigating and combating global climate change. In this study, wood-based ultra-microporous oxygen-enriched carbon materials were prepared by pyrolysis using sawdust from agroforestry biowaste as a carbon source and the green activator HCOOK. The results showed that sample ACK1-800 exhibited substantial adsorption capacity (6.56 mmol/g, 3.06 mmol/g at 273 K and 100 kPa, respectively) and favorable selectivity towards (186 for CO2/N2 and 26 for CH4/N2) for CO2 and CH4. Meanwhile, the material exhibited a modes energy of adsorption (36.6 kJ/ mol for CO2 and 29.3 kJ/ mol for CH4) and stable cycling properties, indicating that the adsorption process involves typical physisorption. In addition, linear correlations of CO2 and CH4 adsorption behaviors were constructed, emphasizing that the volume of ultra-micropores and oxygen functional groups is closely linked to how well the material can absorb things. In conclusion, this study proposes a method of preparing high-performance ACKX-T materials, which realizes the high-value utilization of waste sawdust and provides a new idea for developing new green activators.
