Microchip gas chromatography columns, interfacing and performance Almost four decades of investigations have opened up many avenues to explore the production and utilization of planar (i.e., microchip) gas chromatographic columns. However, there remain many practical constraints that limit their widespread commercialization and use. The main challenges arise from non-ideal column geometries, dead volume issues and inadequate interfacing technologies, which all affect both column performance and range of applications. This review reflects back over the years on the extensive developments in the field, with the goal to stimulate future creative approaches and increased efforts to accelerate microchip gas chromatography development toward reaching its full potential.
