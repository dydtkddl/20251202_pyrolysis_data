You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Glowing to flaming transition in Douglas fir with varied moisture content In wildfires, vegetation can ignite through convective and radiative heating, influenced by factors like wind and fire size. Understanding ignition from these modes is crucial for computational fire models. This study investigates the ignition behavior of Douglas fir branches under convective heating using a custom apparatus, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and computational simulations in Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Ignition delay times were determined from color camera recordings. In all experiments resulting in flaming ignition, glowing combustion preceded it. Fuel moisture content (FMC) significantly impacted ignition, with higher FMC delaying ignition and reducing ignition probability, while lower FMC increased the likelihood of ignition. In tests with flaming ignition, gas-phase ignition occurred near the fuel sample in most cases, though in some, it occurred farther away. High-speed imaging was used to track ignition location and flame propagation when gas-phase ignition occurred at a distance from the sample. TGA revealed how thermal decomposition influenced ignition dynamics. Computational modeling aligned with experimental findings and clarified the role of heat transfer, fuel properties, and FMC on combustion. These results enhance the understanding of vegetation ignition and fire dynamics under convective heating conditions.
