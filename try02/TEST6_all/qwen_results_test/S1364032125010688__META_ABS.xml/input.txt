Critical review of heat transfer advancements using bubbles injection in heat exchangers This review analyzes the role of bubble injection on the enhancement of heat transfer processes across various heat exchanger configurations. Bubble injection disrupts the formation of the thermal boundary layer, induces turbulence, and enhances convective mixing, particularly in the bubbly flow regime, which demonstrates superior thermal performance. Key mechanisms include bubble-induced turbulence, breakup, and coalescence significantly influence fluid mixing and heat transfer enhancement. Its application extends beyond traditional systems, but includes solar collectors and thermal energy storage units, offering improved thermal uniformity and efficiency. Despite these advantages, several challenges and limitations persist. Therefore, high-resolution experimental studies are required to understand small-scale turbulence and bubble dynamics more accurately. Sparger design optimization and precise control of injection parameters also demand further investigation. Empirical data are limited for plate and double pipe heat exchangers, and the effects of surfactants and non-Newtonian fluids remain underexplored. Moreover, advanced CFD models for multiphase bubbly flows, particularly in complex geometries such as shell and coil heat exchangers, are still developing. Future work should prioritize enhancing interface-capturing techniques, integrating high-fidelity turbulence and multiphysics models, and developing efficient computational algorithms. Machine learning can further support the prediction of bubble behavior and the optimization of system performance. Additionally, techno-economic analyses are crucial to assessing the cost-effectiveness of this approach. A multidisciplinary strategy is critical to fully unlock the potential of bubble injection in industrial heat transfer applications. A bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer identified Applied Thermal Engineering as the leading journal in this field.
