You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Organometallic-inspired green catalysts: Biogenic synthesis of metal-decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes for efficient dye remediation The persistent presence of synthetic dyes in wastewater poses significant environmental challenges, necessitating innovative and sustainable approaches for their effective removal. This review article explores the green synthesis of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) and their promising applications in dye degradation. Traditional synthesis methods of MWCNTs often involve hazardous chemicals and energy-intensive processes, prompting a shift towards greener alternatives. The green synthesis of MWCNTs employs eco-friendly routes, such as plant extracts, microbial synthesis, and biomolecule-assisted methods, aligning with the principles of green chemistry. This review systematically examines the various methodologies of green synthesis, highlighting the chemical and biological mechanisms that underpin these processes. Additionally, the characterization techniques used to evaluate the structural and functional attributes of green-synthesized MWCNTs are discussed in detail. The application section focuses on the adsorption mechanisms of dyes on MWCNTs, factors influencing degradation efficiency, and the comparative performance of green-synthesized MWCNTs against conventionally produced counterparts. Emphasis is placed on case studies that demonstrate the practical efficacy of these nanomaterials in removing dyes from aqueous solutions. Despite the potential benefits, challenges such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impacts of large-scale production remain. This review underscores the necessity for ongoing research and development to overcome these barriers, thereby advancing the field of sustainable nanotechnology for environmental applications. The article concludes by proposing future directions and research opportunities to enhance the synthesis and application of green-synthesized MWCNTs in dye degradation, paving the way for sustainable wastewater treatment solutions.
