Organometallic-inspired green catalysts: Biogenic synthesis of metal-decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes for efficient dye remediation The persistent presence of synthetic dyes in wastewater poses significant environmental challenges, necessitating innovative and sustainable approaches for their effective removal. This review article explores the green synthesis of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) and their promising applications in dye degradation. Traditional synthesis methods of MWCNTs often involve hazardous chemicals and energy-intensive processes, prompting a shift towards greener alternatives. The green synthesis of MWCNTs employs eco-friendly routes, such as plant extracts, microbial synthesis, and biomolecule-assisted methods, aligning with the principles of green chemistry. This review systematically examines the various methodologies of green synthesis, highlighting the chemical and biological mechanisms that underpin these processes. Additionally, the characterization techniques used to evaluate the structural and functional attributes of green-synthesized MWCNTs are discussed in detail. The application section focuses on the adsorption mechanisms of dyes on MWCNTs, factors influencing degradation efficiency, and the comparative performance of green-synthesized MWCNTs against conventionally produced counterparts. Emphasis is placed on case studies that demonstrate the practical efficacy of these nanomaterials in removing dyes from aqueous solutions. Despite the potential benefits, challenges such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impacts of large-scale production remain. This review underscores the necessity for ongoing research and development to overcome these barriers, thereby advancing the field of sustainable nanotechnology for environmental applications. The article concludes by proposing future directions and research opportunities to enhance the synthesis and application of green-synthesized MWCNTs in dye degradation, paving the way for sustainable wastewater treatment solutions.
