SSM-FEP/CNTs Composite membranes with CNT-bridged network for durable oil-water separation in high-temperature and corrosive environments The improper disposal of waste oil and industrial oil-water emulsions presents critical ecological and energy challenges, driving the development of robust separation technologies. This study introduces a stainless steel mesh-supported polyperfluorinated ethylene-propylene/carbon nanotube (SSM-FEP/CNTs) composite membrane fabricated via a one-step thermoplastic sintering method. The innovative design leverages CNTs to create a three-dimensional bridging network within the FEP matrix, enhancing mechanical stability, optimizing pore architecture (average pore size: 0.15–0.30 μm), and establishing tubular nanostructured channels for efficient oil transport. The membrane exhibits exceptional stability in harsh environments, with < 5 % performance degradation in pH 2–14, and high temperatures (up to 100°C) during the continuous filtration tests, validated by SEM, FTIR, and TGA analyses. The one-step sintering process ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, with a maximum flux of 52 L·m⁻²·h⁻¹ for kerosene, surpassing conventional polymer membranes. By integrating mechanical robustness, chemical inertness, and structural and transport properties, this composite membrane addresses limitations of low flux, poor durability, and complex fabrication in traditional systems, offering a sustainable solution for industrial wastewater treatment, waste oil recovery (e.g., refineries, marine applications), and closed-loop resource management. Its ability to maintain ultrahigh efficiency and durability under challenging conditions positions it as a transformative technology for environmental remediation and sustainable manufacturing.
