You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

SSM-FEP/CNTs Composite membranes with CNT-bridged network for durable oil-water separation in high-temperature and corrosive environments The improper disposal of waste oil and industrial oil-water emulsions presents critical ecological and energy challenges, driving the development of robust separation technologies. This study introduces a stainless steel mesh-supported polyperfluorinated ethylene-propylene/carbon nanotube (SSM-FEP/CNTs) composite membrane fabricated via a one-step thermoplastic sintering method. The innovative design leverages CNTs to create a three-dimensional bridging network within the FEP matrix, enhancing mechanical stability, optimizing pore architecture (average pore size: 0.15–0.30 μm), and establishing tubular nanostructured channels for efficient oil transport. The membrane exhibits exceptional stability in harsh environments, with < 5 % performance degradation in pH 2–14, and high temperatures (up to 100°C) during the continuous filtration tests, validated by SEM, FTIR, and TGA analyses. The one-step sintering process ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, with a maximum flux of 52 L·m⁻²·h⁻¹ for kerosene, surpassing conventional polymer membranes. By integrating mechanical robustness, chemical inertness, and structural and transport properties, this composite membrane addresses limitations of low flux, poor durability, and complex fabrication in traditional systems, offering a sustainable solution for industrial wastewater treatment, waste oil recovery (e.g., refineries, marine applications), and closed-loop resource management. Its ability to maintain ultrahigh efficiency and durability under challenging conditions positions it as a transformative technology for environmental remediation and sustainable manufacturing.
