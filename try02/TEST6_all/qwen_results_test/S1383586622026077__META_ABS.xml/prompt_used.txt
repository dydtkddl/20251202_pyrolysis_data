You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineering single-atom Pd sites in ZIF-derived porous Co3O4 for enhanced elementary mercury removal Engineering metal-based nanoarchitectures and their atomic-scale arrangement is a promising avenue for enhanced mercury adsorbent activities. Interactions between metal single atoms and substrates result in regulated transitions between distinct reaction processes that boost mercury adsorption activity. Herein, a novel sorbent of porous Co3O4 with Palladium atomic dispersed was successfully prepared by one-step pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 (ZIF-67) precursors. Via engineering single Pd atoms into ZIF-derived Co3O4 (Pd1/Co3O4-ZIF), the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) activated the reducibility of Co3+ in porous Co3O4 to efficiently adsorb and oxidize Hg0, enhancing its mercury removal efficiency. Specifically, Pd1/Co3O4-ZIF exhibited superior sorption performance for Hg0 over a broad range of temperatures (30–350 °C) and high gaseous hourly space velocity (about 555,500 hr−1) with the average Hg0 removal efficiency higher than 98%. The strategy of constructing atomic active sites on the surface of porous metal-oxide to convert adsorbed Hg0 into HgO is a promising approach to solve the problem that Hg0 in flue gas is challenging to remove. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further proved that the existence of a single Pd site on the surface of Co3O4 significantly reduced the energy barrier of Hg0 to HgO at the atomic level. This work contributed to a thorough comprehension of the structural and adsorption properties of the ZIF-derived Co3O4 sorbent engineering with a single atom and enabled the efficient capture of elemental mercury in flue gas by such ZIF-derived sorbent.
