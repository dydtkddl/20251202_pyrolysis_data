Hydrogen production from the methanolysis of ammonia borane by Pd-Co/Al2O3 coated monolithic catalyst The aim of this study is to enable high hydrogen production yield from catalytic methanolysis of ammonia borane (AB) in the presence of a cordierite type ceramic monolithic. The monolithic channel surfaces were coated with Al2O3 by wash-coating method and then this layer was impregnated with 1 wt%Pd-2 wt%Co bimetallic catalyst. SEM-EDX and multi-point BET analysis were used in order to characterize the catalyst. The experimental studies were conducted in a continuous flow type reactor, which was used for the first time in this study. The reactions were carried on low temperature (40 °C), and with various AB feed concentrations and flow rates. It was found that the highest hydrogen production yield (88.5%) was obtained from AB flow rate of 3.3 mL/min, and AB feed concentration of 0.1 wt%. It was concluded that Pd-Co/Al2O3 coated monolithic, which is a stable, active and low-cost catalyst, was a very promising catalyst for on-board hydrogen production from the methanolysis of ammonia borane.
