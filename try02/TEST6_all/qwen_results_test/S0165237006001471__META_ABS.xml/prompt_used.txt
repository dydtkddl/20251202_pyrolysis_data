You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modelling of the pyrolysis of high density polyethylene Product distribution in a fluidized bed reactor The increase in the generation of plastic wastes has triggered the study of different alternatives for their recovery. Pyrolysis appears to be an interesting alternative for the treatment of mixtures of different plastics. The development of a model that simulates polyethylene pyrolysis (one of the most abundant plastics) has been considered interesting in order to analyse the influence of the operation variables on the behaviour of the system. The existing models predict the generation of the main products, paraffins, olefins and diolefins, but not the influence of temperature and residence time on the product distribution. Neither is the formation of aromatics and polyaromatics included. The main objective of this work is the formulation and development of a model that predicts the product distribution obtained in the pyrolysis of polyethylene. In order to do this a mechanistic model has been developed based on a radical mechanism. This model uses a small number of elementary kinetic steps, including initiation, β-scission, H-abstraction, aromatization and radical combination. The results obtained have been validated with experimental results obtained in a fluidized bed reactor in which the pyrolysis process has been studied at different temperatures (640–700°C) and residence times (0.8–2.6s). The results show that the trends experimentally observed for the different temperatures and residence times studied are predicted.
