You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic thermal cracking of Athabasca VR in a closed reactor system Catalytic thermal cracking of the residue is less common, due to high susceptibility of catalysts to deactivation. In this work, cracking of Athabasca vacuum residue in an autoclave at 400 °C was investigated in presence of in situ prepared and commercial alumina nanoparticles as well as drill cuttings. A high liquid yield of ∼90 wt% was obtained. The nanoparticles and drill cuttings (at 30 wt%) contributed to relatively high coke and gas yields. Nevertheless, the catalytic runs had higher quality maltene product. Reducing drill cuttings concentration to 10 wt% gave the highest liquid yield with high quality maltene. Coke inhibition in presence of optimum drill cuttings concentration is attributed to a balance between the rate of coke precursor formation and adsorption onto the cuttings. Subsequently, at a higher temperature, 420 °C, the higher rate of precursor formation led to similar results between the 10 wt% drill cuttings and the control sample. Both toluene insolubles and produced asphaltenes displayed a lower H/C ratio than asphaltenes in the feed, in line with the thermal cracking activity. Thermogravimetry profiles for the produced asphaltenes was attained at higher temperatures than the toluene insolubles, and was initial-mass sensitive. Accordingly, thermogravimetry profiles should not be indefinitely used to identify the different oil fractions.
