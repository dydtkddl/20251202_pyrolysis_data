You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics and tyre wear particles in urban runoff from different urban surfaces Urban runoff is an important conveyor of microplastics (MPs) and tyre wear particles (TWP) to receiving waters. However, knowledge of contributions by surfaces within land use type/activities is currently limited. To address this knowledge gap, runoff samples were collected simultaneously during three rainfall events in October and November 2020 at three locations in Luleå, Sweden, with different urban surfaces (parking lot, road and roof). The occurrence of MPs (by number and estimated mass) and TWP (mass) were determined using μ-FTIR and Pyr-GC/MS, respectively. MPs and TWP were found at all sites in all events, with large variations between events and sites. The highest concentrations of MPs (number) and TWP were found in road runoff followed by parking lot runoff and roof runoff. The mass concentrations of MPs did not follow the same pattern and were generally highest at the parking lot, highlighting the importance of reporting data as both mass and particle numbers to derive a complete overview of MPs and TWP behaviour. Polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyester accounted, on average, for 99 % of MP polymers (by mass and number) at all sites with common sources, including traffic (vehicle wear and tear) and littering. MPs in the 50 % of the total number of MPs in parking lot runoff, >58 % in roof runoff and > 90 % in road runoff.
