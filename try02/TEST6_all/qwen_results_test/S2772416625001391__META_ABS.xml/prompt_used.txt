You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A scoping review on the European Union agricultural plastic waste management strategies: focusing on liquefaction Agricultural plastic waste (APW) poses a growing global environmental threat, with Europe generating over 1.3 million tonnes annually. This paper presents a multidisciplinary scoping review of agriplastic waste management strategies, emphasizing policies, technological advancements, and socio-economic factors within the European Union. The novelty of this study lies in its integrated approach—bridging environmental science, engineering, policy analysis, and behavioral studies—to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of various APW strategies. While mechanical recycling remains cost-effective (€300–€600 per ton) for clean, homogeneous plastics, it is limited by contamination issues in mixed waste. Chemical recycling methods—such as glycolysis and methanolysis—are suitable for specific polymers like PET, with potential emission reductions up to 60 % compared to virgin plastic production, though economic viability remains a barrier. Energy recovery techniques, including incineration and pyrolysis, are applicable to heterogeneous waste but emit hazardous pollutants such as dioxins and furans. A key focus is on liquefaction, a promising but underexplored method, which can convert APW into low-carbon fuels with up to 70 % lower lifecycle emissions; however, its commercial scalability is currently constrained by high capital costs and technical challenges. The study highlights that optimal APW strategies depend on plastic type, intended product, environmental impact, and economic considerations. It also underscores the critical role of EU policy, producer responsibility schemes, and public awareness in fostering sustainable management. Ultimately, this work advocates for a tailored, holistic approach to APW, aligning technological innovation with regulatory and behavioral interventions.
