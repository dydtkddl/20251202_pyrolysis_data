A scoping review on the European Union agricultural plastic waste management strategies: focusing on liquefaction Agricultural plastic waste (APW) poses a growing global environmental threat, with Europe generating over 1.3 million tonnes annually. This paper presents a multidisciplinary scoping review of agriplastic waste management strategies, emphasizing policies, technological advancements, and socio-economic factors within the European Union. The novelty of this study lies in its integrated approach—bridging environmental science, engineering, policy analysis, and behavioral studies—to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of various APW strategies. While mechanical recycling remains cost-effective (€300–€600 per ton) for clean, homogeneous plastics, it is limited by contamination issues in mixed waste. Chemical recycling methods—such as glycolysis and methanolysis—are suitable for specific polymers like PET, with potential emission reductions up to 60 % compared to virgin plastic production, though economic viability remains a barrier. Energy recovery techniques, including incineration and pyrolysis, are applicable to heterogeneous waste but emit hazardous pollutants such as dioxins and furans. A key focus is on liquefaction, a promising but underexplored method, which can convert APW into low-carbon fuels with up to 70 % lower lifecycle emissions; however, its commercial scalability is currently constrained by high capital costs and technical challenges. The study highlights that optimal APW strategies depend on plastic type, intended product, environmental impact, and economic considerations. It also underscores the critical role of EU policy, producer responsibility schemes, and public awareness in fostering sustainable management. Ultimately, this work advocates for a tailored, holistic approach to APW, aligning technological innovation with regulatory and behavioral interventions.
