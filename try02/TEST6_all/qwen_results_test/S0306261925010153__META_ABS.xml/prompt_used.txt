You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for energy efficient propylene production via propane dehydrogenation pathways–A review The production of numerous industrial products, including synthetic rubber, paints, coatings, and plastics, depends heavily on propylene. Interest in creative, effective propylene manufacturing is sparked by rising demand. Direct dehydrogenation of propane is a method for generating only propylene while avoiding byproducts. Pt and CrOx catalysts are used in the key petroleum process of C3H8 to C3H6 dehydrogenation. However, they are expensive and ineffective for selecting propylene. Research focuses on new catalysts and supports to increase selectivity, stability, and activity. Exploring single and bimetal catalysts and different supports improves the dehydrogenation process. This review paper summarises recent developments and fundamental principles behind the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The emphasis is on modern technology, catalyst improvements, and novel chemical approaches to manage catalytic structures and avoid deactivation. An in-depth analysis of active sites, reaction pathways, and deactivation mechanisms involving various metals, bimetals, and supports have been discussed in detail. This review highlights emerging trends in catalyst design focused on reducing activation energy barriers and enhancing selectivity for propylene in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). High paraffin conversion requires temperatures between 550–750 °C and low partial pressures, which, while thermodynamically favourable, pose significant challenges. These harsh conditions can cause sintering, loss of active metal dispersion, and coke formation, leading to catalyst deactivation. Consequently, developing thermally stable, coke-resistant catalysts that maintain activity and selectivity under these extreme conditions is crucial for efficient PDH.
