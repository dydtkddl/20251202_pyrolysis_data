Advanced monometallic and bimetallic catalysts for energy efficient propylene production via propane dehydrogenation pathways–A review The production of numerous industrial products, including synthetic rubber, paints, coatings, and plastics, depends heavily on propylene. Interest in creative, effective propylene manufacturing is sparked by rising demand. Direct dehydrogenation of propane is a method for generating only propylene while avoiding byproducts. Pt and CrOx catalysts are used in the key petroleum process of C3H8 to C3H6 dehydrogenation. However, they are expensive and ineffective for selecting propylene. Research focuses on new catalysts and supports to increase selectivity, stability, and activity. Exploring single and bimetal catalysts and different supports improves the dehydrogenation process. This review paper summarises recent developments and fundamental principles behind the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. The emphasis is on modern technology, catalyst improvements, and novel chemical approaches to manage catalytic structures and avoid deactivation. An in-depth analysis of active sites, reaction pathways, and deactivation mechanisms involving various metals, bimetals, and supports have been discussed in detail. This review highlights emerging trends in catalyst design focused on reducing activation energy barriers and enhancing selectivity for propylene in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). High paraffin conversion requires temperatures between 550–750 °C and low partial pressures, which, while thermodynamically favourable, pose significant challenges. These harsh conditions can cause sintering, loss of active metal dispersion, and coke formation, leading to catalyst deactivation. Consequently, developing thermally stable, coke-resistant catalysts that maintain activity and selectivity under these extreme conditions is crucial for efficient PDH.
