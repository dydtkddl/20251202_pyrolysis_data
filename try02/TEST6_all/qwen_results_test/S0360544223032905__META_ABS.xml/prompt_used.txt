You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integration of thermal plasma with CCUS to valorize sewage sludge The presented study addresses the threefold challenges namely, sustainable waste valorization of a difficult waste stream, climate change due to CO2 emissions and clean energy crisis and it is a small step forward to achieve SDG-7. A hybrid DC thermal plasma was employed in a pilot scale facility (∼150 kW) to treat sewage sludge in the presence of waste CO2 (according to the concept of CCUS, Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) to produce syngas and assess the viability to retrieve phosphorus and other valuable materials from the generated ash. An equilibrium model was also developed to enhance the understanding about the dynamics of process. The H2 generation was around 0.5 m3/kg fuel whereas the amount of char produced was negligible (0–0.013 kg/kg fuel) realizing an efficient transformation of carbon. It was promising to find a high amount of P2O5 in the ash retained in the filter (30 wt %) and reactor (9 wt %) as evaluated by XRF. An average value of 97 % was obtained for CCE (carbon conversion efficiency) depicting almost complete carbon conversion. The results are encouraging to valorize sewage sludge under the CCUS scheme to produce clean energy and reclaim valuable nutrients.
