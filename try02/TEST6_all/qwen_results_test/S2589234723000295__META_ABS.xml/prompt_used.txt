You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of melt-state shear homogenization on catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste for feedstock recycling Although significant effort has been made to develop separation and sorting strategies for recycling mixed plastic waste in recent decades, these processes are often complex, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, and may not be efficient when scaled up. This research aims to evaluate the potential of a homogenization and dechlorination algorithm based on a remelting-restabilization technique to improve the homogeneity of heterogeneous mixed plastic waste through high-shear pulverization. The effectiveness of this method for chemical recycling in the presence of a synthesized clay catalyst was evaluated and modeled using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) and kinetic studies. The results showed a significant increase in the homogeneity level of mixed plastic in terms of physical, thermal, and rheological behavior after two runs of extrusions. Additionally, the amount of chlorine in the mixed waste samples was reduced from 18.3 mg/kg to 1.45 mg/kg after thermal treatment at 300 °C for 2 hours. The inclusion of a modified clay catalyst resulted in a reduction in activation energy and initial degradation temperature by approximately 13% and 31%, respectively. The modeled kinetics results showed that the reaction rate in the presence of the catalyst increased at both low and high conversions over a wide range of temperatures. However, an increase in the number of extrusions only increased the degradation rate at high temperatures due to induced thermal history. Py-GC-MS test results revealed that the use of clay catalyst in homogenized samples enhanced the amount of low carbon atom products (C5 to C12) by 7.5% and 27% at 450 °C and 550 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the amount of aromatic product increased after the inclusion of the clay catalyst for both pyrolysis temperatures, including 450 °C and 550 °C.
