You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Depolymerization of HDPE to wax in the presence of a catalyst formed by homonuclear macrocyclic zirconium complex chemically bonded to alumina support A homonuclear macrocyclic Zr–Zr complex was prepared starting with 2,6-diformyl-phenol and 1,2-phenylene diamine and is chemically bonded with carbamate-modified alumina. The TPD of the catalyst having adsorbed NH3 shows the presence of acid sites on the surface of the catalyst and the catalyst is stable under the reaction temperature studied. The catalytic depolymerization of commercially available high-density polyethylene (molecular weight 4.79×105) was carried out in the presence of nitrogen as well as oxygen at about pressure of 300 of kg/cm2 and temperature of 370°C. Catalytic depolymerization in the presence N2 occurs with the time delay of 2h (as opposed to 4h for thermal depolymerization occurring above 400°C) and stops with the formation of wax (as opposed to C5–C16 liquidous alkanes in thermal depolymerization). The wax thus formed was characterized and shown to be the Arge wax (available commercially) having a melting point of 80°C and molecular weight of 392. We have proposed a kinetic model in which the catalyst forms a complex with polyethylene radical formed at high temperature, which gives depolymerization to form wax molecules.
