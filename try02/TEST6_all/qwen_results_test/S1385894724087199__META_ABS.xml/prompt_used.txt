You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding the kinetics of waste plastic catalytic pyrolysis under microwave irradiation for enhanced resource valorization The increasing accumulation of ABS plastic waste poses significant environmental challenges, necessitating efficient methods for its disposal and recycling. The pyrolysis of the ABS plastic waste was performed under various heating programs including constant heating rate (27.5, 42.2 and 65 K min−1), and sample-controlled reaction rate (0.01 min−1) to obtain the TG curves using the in-house developed microwave assisted thermogravimetric analyzer. Fe-impregnated SiC was used as thermal and chemical catalyst, while neat SiC played only thermal catalyst role. The modified Sestak-Bergren equation used to model the TG data by Pearson’s linear correlation and associated parameters n = 1.129 and m = 0.27 was achieved. The comparison of normalized form of the conversion function (f (α)/f (0.5)) with the most common models of solid-state reactions showed that random scission model (L2) was the most suitable approach to physically explain the pyrolysis of ABS plastic waste. Furthermore, by applying isoconversional kinetic analysis, the variation of activation energy (Eα) with conversion value was approximately constant. The Eα obtained was 140.5 and 63.7 kJ/mol with SiC and Fe/SiC, respectively. These findings hold practical implications for industrial applications or waste management strategies, particularly when considering the developed microwave-assisted real-time TGA-pyrolysis, which can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of plastic waste recycling processes.
