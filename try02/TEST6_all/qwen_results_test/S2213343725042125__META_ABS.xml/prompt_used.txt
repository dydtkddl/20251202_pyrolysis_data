You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel recycling strategy of decommissioned photovoltaic silicon cell toward preparing high-performance silicon-carbon anodes The recycling of decommissioned photovoltaic (PV) modules has become a significant environmental concern with the accelerated growth of the global PV industry. Fortunately, silicon anode represents an optimal candidate for advanced lithium-ion battery technologies owing to their exceptional theoretical lithium storage capability approaching 4200 mAh g⁻¹ . A novel recycling strategy is proposed to prepare high-performance silicon-carbon anode materials with the decommissioned PV silicon cell and agricultural waste banana peels. A synergistic process of high-energy ball-milling and elevated-temperature sintering is utilized to form the carbon-coated silicon structure of the silicon-carbon anode materials. The material characterization results demonstrated that the carbon-coated structure effectively mitigated silicon's volumetric variations while enhancing charge transfer capabilities. Electrochemical performance tests confirmed that the material maintained a reversible lithium storage capacity of 1378.60 mAh g⁻¹ at 200 mA g⁻1,for 500 cycles,corresponding to a fourfold over conventional graphite anodes. Furthermore, the material demonstrated outstanding cycling stability and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.72 %, nearly matching the theoretical value. An economic analysis showed a 69.6 % reduction in production costs compared to the traditional silicon-carbon anode synthesis method, highlighting the economic viability of this “waste-to-energy” strategy. It constructs a new model of circular economy integrating "photovoltaic-lithium-agriculture" with the synergistic high-value utilization of PV waste and agricultural waste. This proposed model offers novel approaches to address sustainability challenges in PV industry development.
