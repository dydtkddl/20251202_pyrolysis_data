A novel recycling strategy of decommissioned photovoltaic silicon cell toward preparing high-performance silicon-carbon anodes The recycling of decommissioned photovoltaic (PV) modules has become a significant environmental concern with the accelerated growth of the global PV industry. Fortunately, silicon anode represents an optimal candidate for advanced lithium-ion battery technologies owing to their exceptional theoretical lithium storage capability approaching 4200 mAh g⁻¹ . A novel recycling strategy is proposed to prepare high-performance silicon-carbon anode materials with the decommissioned PV silicon cell and agricultural waste banana peels. A synergistic process of high-energy ball-milling and elevated-temperature sintering is utilized to form the carbon-coated silicon structure of the silicon-carbon anode materials. The material characterization results demonstrated that the carbon-coated structure effectively mitigated silicon's volumetric variations while enhancing charge transfer capabilities. Electrochemical performance tests confirmed that the material maintained a reversible lithium storage capacity of 1378.60 mAh g⁻¹ at 200 mA g⁻1,for 500 cycles,corresponding to a fourfold over conventional graphite anodes. Furthermore, the material demonstrated outstanding cycling stability and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.72 %, nearly matching the theoretical value. An economic analysis showed a 69.6 % reduction in production costs compared to the traditional silicon-carbon anode synthesis method, highlighting the economic viability of this “waste-to-energy” strategy. It constructs a new model of circular economy integrating "photovoltaic-lithium-agriculture" with the synergistic high-value utilization of PV waste and agricultural waste. This proposed model offers novel approaches to address sustainability challenges in PV industry development.
