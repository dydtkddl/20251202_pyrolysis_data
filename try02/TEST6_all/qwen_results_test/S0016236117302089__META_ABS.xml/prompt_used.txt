You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of hydrocarbon vaporization and gases solubility on performance and cycle length of gas-phase – Trickle bed reactors system used for deep diesel hydrotreatment The use of high-pressure, high-temperature diesel stripper ahead of the reactors boosts low-sulfur diesel production on existing HDT units. The new hydrotreating process scheme use a combination gas phase and liquid phase reactors to treat Diesel. The gas and liquid properties of the stream were determined in dynamic conditions and hydrocarbon vaporization and gases solubility simulated based on Peng-Robinson state equation with modified pseudo-species properties, interaction coefficients and mixing rules. The gas-liquid pseudo-equilibrium simulation allows calculation of concentration of pseudo-species present in gas-liquid separators and in reactors along the cycle length. The new experimental vapor-liquid equilibria data were developed for synthetic feed, diesel, diesel plus hydrotreated product and product of reaction at high-temperature and high-pressure. This data was used to developed new sets of A kl, B kl, E and F parameters for interaction coefficients and blending values. The results of simulation using Peng Robinson EOS state equation with new interaction coefficients and rules for blending show an improvement in the prediction of pseudo-species vaporization and solubility of hydrogen, methane, ethane, and hydrogen sulfide on liquid phase (diesel). Prediction of gas-liquid pseudo species concentration and phase properties along the cycle length have significant impact on the economy of the new HDT process. Experimental dynamic VLPE data is included.
