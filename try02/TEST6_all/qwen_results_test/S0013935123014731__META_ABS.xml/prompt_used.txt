You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon dioxide gasification characteristics of disposable COVID-19 masks using bubbling fluidized bed reactor The global demand for masks has increased significantly owing to COVID-19 and mutated viruses, resulting in a massive amount of mask waste of approximately 490,000 tons per month. Mask waste recycling is challenging because of the composition of multicomponent polymers and iron, which puts them at risk of viral infection. Conventional treatment methods also cause environmental pollution. Gasification is an effective method for processing multicomponent plastics and obtaining syngas for various applications. This study investigated the carbon dioxide gasification and tar removal characteristics of an activated carbon bed using a 1-kg/h laboratory-scale bubble fluidized bed gasifier. The syngas composition was analyzed as 10.52 vol% of hydrogen, 6.18 vol% of carbon monoxide, 12.05 vol% of methane, and 14.44 vol% of hydrocarbons (C2–C3). The results of carbon dioxide gasification with activated carbon showed a tar-reduction efficiency of 49%, carbon conversion efficiency of 45.16%, and cold gas efficiency of 88.92%. This study provides basic data on mask waste carbon dioxide gasification using greenhouse gases as useful product gases.
