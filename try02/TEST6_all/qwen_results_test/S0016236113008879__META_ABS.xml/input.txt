Gasification of a solid recovered fuel in a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor The paper investigates the technical feasibility of an air gasification process of a Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) obtained from municipal solid waste. A pilot scale bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, having a feedstock capacity of about 70kg/h and a maximum thermal output of about 400kW, provided the experimental data: the complete composition of the syngas (including the tar, particulate and acid/basic gas contents), the chemical and physical characterization of the bed material and that of entrained fines collected at the cyclone. The experimental runs were carried out by reaching a condition of thermal and chemical steady state under values of equivalence ratio ranging from 0.25 to 0.33. The results indicate that the selected SRF can be conveniently gasified, yielding a syngas of valuable quality for energy applications. The rather high content of tar in the syngas indicates that the more appropriate plant configuration should be that of a “thermal gasifier”, with the direct combustion of the syngas in a burner ad hoc designed, coupled with an adequate energy-conversion device.
