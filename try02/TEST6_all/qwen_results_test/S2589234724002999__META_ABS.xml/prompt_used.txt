You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements and approaches in developing MXene-based hybrid composites for improved supercapacitor electrodes The rapid increase in population and widespread use of energy-consuming technologies are contributing to a substantial increase in the world's energy consumption. Supercapacitors have recently become a more desirable alternative due to their quick charging and discharging times, high power densities, and extended cycle lives. For many researchers, improving supercapacitor efficiency for multifunctional applications is a major area of study. Many elements have been employed as electrode materials to provide the best energy and power density while achieving the largest specific capacitance. Among these materials, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, commonly called MXenes, are emerging candidates, particularly in electrochemical energy storage applications. Because of their strength, flexibility, unique structure, increased electrical conductivity, large surface area, diversity of active sites, hydrophobicity, and hydrophilicity for cutting-edge energy storage technologies, MXenes are among the best active electrode materials. MXene, with its unique 2D layered structure, offers the infinite possibility of the intercalation of various capacitive materials. Also, MXenes have the properties of high hydrophilicity of metal oxides and high electrical conductivity of metals. Alongside, activated carbon (AC), graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), transition metal oxides, and conducting polymers (CPs) act as excellent electrode materials owing to their outstanding thermal, mechanical, electrical, and morphological properties. According to recent studies, one of the perfect methods for energy storage applications is to integrate MXenes with other superior elements for generating MXene-based composite electrode materials. This review includes recent developments in the investigation of MXene-based hybrid composites for supercapacitors. It covers composite's synthesis strategies, electrode architecture, electrochemical performance, and their efficiency in supercapacitors.
