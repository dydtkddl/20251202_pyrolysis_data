You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal decomposition of virgin and waste polylactic acid with subcritical water under N2 and air atmospheres Bio-based polymers are an important step towards solving environmental problems, but there is a need to consider and develop procedures for dealing with these materials at the end of their life and to ensure that effective disposal methods are available. Recently, polylactic acid (PLA) has replaced many plastics based on non-renewable resources. In this work, subcritical water was used for the chemical decomposition of virgin and waste PLA under different atmospheres. The main degradation product was lactic acid with very high yields. The highest yield of lactic acid was obtained under N2 atmosphere, where the optimum conditions were 200 °C and 60 min and the yield was 88.96 ± 1.5 % for virgin PLA and 54.58 ± 1.3 % for waste PLA. In an air atmosphere, the maximum yields of lactic acid were obtained at 250 °C and 30 min and were slightly lower than in the N2 atmosphere, i.e. 87.20 ± 0.9 % for virgin PLA and 49.29 ± 0.6 % for waste PLA. The lower yield of lactic acid from waste PLA is due to the impurities and additives in waste PLA. Other carboxylic acids were also formed in the aqueous phase, while the gas phase mainly contained CO2, N2/CO and C1-C5 hydrocarbons. The hydrothermal degradation pathway was presented and the electricity costs for lab-scale PLA recycling were estimated. With this sustainable technology, PLA could be successfully recycled down to its monomer, providing a secondary raw material for the re-synthesis of the polymer, closing the loop and reducing the impact on the environment.
