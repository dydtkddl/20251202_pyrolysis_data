Review on solid-gas sorption heat storage: Materials, processes and system optimization Benefiting from the high energy density, versatile operating patterns and long-duration heat storage capacity with negligible heat loss, solid-gas sorption heat storage is considered as an innovative technology for harvesting renewable energy and industrial low-grade heat. The sorption heat storage technology has aroused enormous interest in the past decade but still lingers in the stage of laboratory investigation. In this paper, the selection criteria of sorption heat storage materials were proposed. Moreover, the characteristics and properties of various sorption materials have been introduced. Then, the optimization of the sorption heat storage materials has been elaborated. Additionally, various reactors with different structures have been reviewed and the optimized design schemes of sorption reactors have been discussed. Meanwhile, the sorption cycle processes optimization and coupled system design are addressed. This study establishes a full route from material scale to system prototype scale for sorption heat storage technology. This work will help researchers to have a comprehensive understanding of the sorption heat storage technology and provide a lot more worthwhile insights for future researches on the solid-gas sorption heat storage, and thus foster the sorption heat storage technology to fulfill further improvements.
