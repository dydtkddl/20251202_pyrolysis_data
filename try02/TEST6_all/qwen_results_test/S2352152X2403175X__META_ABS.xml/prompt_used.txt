You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on solid-gas sorption heat storage: Materials, processes and system optimization Benefiting from the high energy density, versatile operating patterns and long-duration heat storage capacity with negligible heat loss, solid-gas sorption heat storage is considered as an innovative technology for harvesting renewable energy and industrial low-grade heat. The sorption heat storage technology has aroused enormous interest in the past decade but still lingers in the stage of laboratory investigation. In this paper, the selection criteria of sorption heat storage materials were proposed. Moreover, the characteristics and properties of various sorption materials have been introduced. Then, the optimization of the sorption heat storage materials has been elaborated. Additionally, various reactors with different structures have been reviewed and the optimized design schemes of sorption reactors have been discussed. Meanwhile, the sorption cycle processes optimization and coupled system design are addressed. This study establishes a full route from material scale to system prototype scale for sorption heat storage technology. This work will help researchers to have a comprehensive understanding of the sorption heat storage technology and provide a lot more worthwhile insights for future researches on the solid-gas sorption heat storage, and thus foster the sorption heat storage technology to fulfill further improvements.
