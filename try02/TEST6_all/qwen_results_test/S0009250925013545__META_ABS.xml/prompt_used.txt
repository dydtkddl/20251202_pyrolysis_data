You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of n-paraffin coexisting with olefin over ZSM-5 based catalysts: Experiments, kinetics, and DFT calculations This study investigates the co-cracking of n-hexane and 1-hexene, utilizing 1-hexene as an olefinic initiator to improve light olefin yields. Experimental investigations, kinetic analyses, and density functional theory calculations (DFT) were used to systematically explore cracking performance, interactions, and mechanisms for co-feeding. Comparied with single feeding of n-hexane, leading to higher light olefin yields (increased from 35.77 wt% to 58.61 wt%) when the olefin content is 20 wt%. Kinetic analysis revealed a shift from protolytic to hydrogen transfer cracking pathway when 1-hexene content exceeded 13.6 wt%, with the maximum cracking rate (13.12 h−1) constant at 20 wt% olefin content. DFT calculations showed a lower energy barrier for hydrogen transfer cracking between n-hexane and 1-hexene, compared to n-hexane cracking alone. Therefore, a co-cracking mechanism was proposed, involving paraffin activation through carbocation intermediates generated by olefin, followed by β-cracking to generated light olefins and carbenium ion regeneration, establishing a framework for paraffin-olefin co-conversion.
