You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Identification of polymer species in a complex mixture by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry as a basis for environmental microplastic analysis Pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS) was applied for the reliable identification of polymer species in a complex mixture to establish this system as a platform for environmental microplastic analysis. The method was evaluated on a model sample of mixed microplastics comprised of five major polymers: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polystyrene (PSt), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The representative ions in the mass spectra of the pyrolyzates were identified by Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS measurements of the individual polymer species. The unique APCI ionization/fragmentation process and the high mass resolution of TOFMS were exploited to confirm the presence of the respective polymer species in the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the mixed sample for the selected key ions. PE and PP were successfully and uniquely identified in the mixed sample by focusing on specific fragment ions of the pyrolyzates formed during APCI (m/z 114.093 ± 0.020 and m/z 156.139 ± 0.020, respectively). The resultant EICs allowed for the specific analysis of these species, even in the presence of interfering species produced from the other polymers. Similar processes were applied to the detection of PVC, PSt, and PET in the mixed sample. These results demonstrated that Py-GC-APCI-TOFMS is a promising tool to characterize a complex mixture of environmental microplastics.
