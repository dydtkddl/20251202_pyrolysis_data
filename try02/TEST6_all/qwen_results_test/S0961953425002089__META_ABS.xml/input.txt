Valorization of agave bagasse as a bio-template for circular economy: Applications in energy conversion, metabolite production, and sustainable material synthesis Agave bagasse corresponds to the main solid waste generated in the production of agave alcoholic beverages. According to its composition, this material can be considered as a biological template useful to guide the synthesis of new products, services and materials. In this sense, the present communication represents the physicochemical characterization of agave bagasse as well as the compilation of recent applications that have been reported in the literature. Several strategies have been considered to reuse these residues for many purposes such as energy conversion and management, substrate for metabolite production, and for material applications.
