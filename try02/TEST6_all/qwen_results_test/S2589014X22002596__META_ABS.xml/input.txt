Recent technological innovations on continuous microwave assisted biomass pyrolysis and perspectives for industrial scale applications Continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) is one of the most promising technologies for biomass valorization into biochar, bio-oil and, syngas. This review shows the recent technological innovations for the continuous pyrolysis of biomass assisted by microwave. The main challenges for the transition of CMP to the industrial scale are analyzed: to ensure the propagation of the waves and their absorption in larger volumes; to control the penetration of the waves in a way that the irradiated volume continues to be compatible with the depth of penetration; to control the evolution of the medium (solid-liquid-gas multiphase) the evacuation and the separation of the process products; the fouling of the reactor; the energy efficiency of the technology and the compatibility of the power density with the change of scale, considering that the power of the magnetrons is limited. Several different types of continuous microwave reactors are presented, paying attention to the innovations presented on patent databases. To achieve economic viability, further development of this technology is necessary, as multi-mode propagation and temperature homogenization are not necessarily adequate to fully exploit the specificity and advantages of microwaves. Energy optimization of the CMP is also necessary to increase its economic viability, for example by reducing heat loss and utilizing waste energy.
