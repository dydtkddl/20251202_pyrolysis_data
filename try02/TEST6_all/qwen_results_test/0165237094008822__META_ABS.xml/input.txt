Characterization of stereoregular polystyrenes by pyrolysis-gas chromatography The tacticity of polystyrene (PS) was investigated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC) using fused silica and metal capillary separation columns at high oven temperatures. Characteristic fragments of the PS-chain, ranging from monomer to pentamers, were observed in the pyrograms. The relative intensities of the tetramer and pentamer peaks reflected the original tacticities with good reproducibility; the tacticity of PS could then be determined with a calibration curve prepared using well characterized PS standard samples. The potential ability of supercritical fluid chromatography to study the tacticity of PS was also examined.
