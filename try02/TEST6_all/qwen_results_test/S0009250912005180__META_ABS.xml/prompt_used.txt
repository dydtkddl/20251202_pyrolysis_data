You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solar thermal decoupled water electrolysis process I: Proof of concept A new concept for a solar thermal electrolytic process was developed for the production of H2 from water. A metal oxide is reduced to a lower oxidation state in air with concentrated solar energy. The reduced oxide is then used either as an anode or solute for the electrolytic production of H2 in either an aqueous acid or base solution. The presence of the reduced metal oxide as part of the electrolytic cell decreases the potential required for water electrolysis below the ideal 1.23 V required when H2 and O2 evolve at 1 bar and 298 K. During electrolysis, H2 evolves at the cathode at 1 bar while the reduced metal oxide is returned to its original oxidation state, thus completing the H2 production cycle. Ideal sunlight-to-hydrogen thermal efficiencies were established for three oxide systems: Fe2O3–Fe3O4, Co3O4–CoO, and Mn2O3–Mn3O4. The ideal efficiencies that include radiation heat loss are as high or higher than corresponding ideal values reported in the solar thermal chemistry literature. An exploratory experimental study for the iron oxide system confirmed that the electrolytic and thermal reduction steps occur in a laboratory scale environment.
