You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fundamentals, advances and perspectives of piezocatalysis: A marriage of solid-state physics and catalytic chemistry Piezocatalysis, an evolving catalytic technology built on the piezoelectric properties of catalysts, breaks down the barrier between mechanical energy and chemical energy. The potential difference that arises from the mechanical deformation of a piezoelectric material is commonly termed ‘piezopotential’. Piezopotential has been demonstrated to facilitate the manipulation of band structure and/or charge carrier separation. Despite significant efforts to design materials and understand the mechanism of piezoelectrically enhanced chemistry through semiconductor physics, there remains an opportunity to review the relationships between catalytic performance and piezo/ferroelectric properties. Herein, we provide a comprehensive summary of the catalytic mechanisms and correlated piezo/ferroelectric physical mechanism in the field of piezocatalysis. A fundamental understanding of piezo/ferroelectric structural design based on solid-state physics can be used to shed light on the future development of piezocatalysis. In addition, the types of piezoelectric materials, the design strategies for catalysis efficiency enhancement, and the up-to-date applications in environment remediation, renewable energy conversion, biomedicine and biotechnology are discussed. Finally, future perspectives for designing and developing highly active piezocatalysts using the guidelines of physicochemical relationships are proposed.
