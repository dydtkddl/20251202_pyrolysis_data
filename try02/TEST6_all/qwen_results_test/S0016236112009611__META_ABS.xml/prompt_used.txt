You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics and equilibrium study of phenol adsorption on nitrogen-enriched activated carbons The influence of an enhanced amount of nitrogen functionalities in activated carbon (AC) upon the adsorption of phenol from water was studied. The ACs were prepared from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and a mixture of PAN and coal-tar pitch (CTP) by a process of carbonization followed by activation with steam. Because AC produced from a mixture of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CTP (1:1w/w) has a high capacity to adsorb phenol, it was used as a reference of AC without nitrogen functionalities at the surface. All the ACs were characterized by similar porous textures but different nitrogen contents, in the range of 0.75–7.42wt%. These features imply differences in the basicity of the carbon surface. The contribution of pyridinic nitrogen amounted to 26–34% of the total nitrogen content in the nitrogen-enriched ACs (N-ACs). The phenol adsorption measurements were carried out in static conditions at ambient temperature. The pseudo-second order kinetics and Langmuir models were found to fit the experimental data very well. For N-ACs the adsorption was characterized by a very high affinity of phenol towards the carbon surface. However, an enhanced nitrogen content improved the adsorption capacity of the AC only slightly. The adsorption of phenol occurred mainly in micropores smaller than 1.4nm, where the pore filling mechanism prevails. The contribution of pyridinic nitrogen to phenol adsorption in wider micropores is discussed in details.
