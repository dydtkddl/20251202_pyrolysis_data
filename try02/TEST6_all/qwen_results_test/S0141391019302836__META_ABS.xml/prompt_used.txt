You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of corrugated cardboard biochar as reinforcing fiber on properties, biodegradability and weatherability of wood-plastic composites Corrugated cardboard (CCB) was pyrolyzed at different temperatures (350, 400 and 450 °C) to produce biochar fibers. The biochar and CCB control fibers were then compounded with high density polyethylene (HDPE) and maleated polyethylene (MAPE) to prepare wood plastic composites (WPC). The effect of different pyrolysis temperature biochars on the WPC's mechanical, thermal and viscoelastic properties, water absorptions, rheological behavior, weatherability and biodurability performance were evaluated. The CCB composite melts showed higher modulus and viscosity than biochar composites, indicating better melt strength. Compared with CCB composites, an increase of tensile strength (4%) and tensile modulus (30%) could be observed in composites made from CCB 350 °C biochar. In addition, the CCB biochar composite showed lower tan δ and adhesion factor, indicating the strong interfacial interaction between biochar fibers and HDPE. The composite melting temperatures (Tm) were not significantly different. The degree of HDPE crystallinity in the biochar composites decreased relative to the CCB composites, while the thermal properties of the composites improved compared with CCB composites. The CCB composite displayed the highest water absorption (3.9%) and thickness swell (3.8%) after 70 d. The CCB biochar (450 °C) composite experienced the least color change, lightless and carbonyl concentrations due to weathering. Pyrolysis of CCB reduced weight loss in the resulting composites exposed to fungi compared with the CCB composite. Using CCB biochar led to a more biodurable WPC.
