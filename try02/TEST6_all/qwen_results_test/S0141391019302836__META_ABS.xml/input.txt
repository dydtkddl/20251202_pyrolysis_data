Evaluation of corrugated cardboard biochar as reinforcing fiber on properties, biodegradability and weatherability of wood-plastic composites Corrugated cardboard (CCB) was pyrolyzed at different temperatures (350, 400 and 450 °C) to produce biochar fibers. The biochar and CCB control fibers were then compounded with high density polyethylene (HDPE) and maleated polyethylene (MAPE) to prepare wood plastic composites (WPC). The effect of different pyrolysis temperature biochars on the WPC's mechanical, thermal and viscoelastic properties, water absorptions, rheological behavior, weatherability and biodurability performance were evaluated. The CCB composite melts showed higher modulus and viscosity than biochar composites, indicating better melt strength. Compared with CCB composites, an increase of tensile strength (4%) and tensile modulus (30%) could be observed in composites made from CCB 350 °C biochar. In addition, the CCB biochar composite showed lower tan δ and adhesion factor, indicating the strong interfacial interaction between biochar fibers and HDPE. The composite melting temperatures (Tm) were not significantly different. The degree of HDPE crystallinity in the biochar composites decreased relative to the CCB composites, while the thermal properties of the composites improved compared with CCB composites. The CCB composite displayed the highest water absorption (3.9%) and thickness swell (3.8%) after 70 d. The CCB biochar (450 °C) composite experienced the least color change, lightless and carbonyl concentrations due to weathering. Pyrolysis of CCB reduced weight loss in the resulting composites exposed to fungi compared with the CCB composite. Using CCB biochar led to a more biodurable WPC.
