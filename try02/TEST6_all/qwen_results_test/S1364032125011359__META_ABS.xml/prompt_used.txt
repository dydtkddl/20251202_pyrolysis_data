You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in coupled multiphase flow and heat transfer in nanoporous media: Current status, challenges, and frontier directions Nanoporous media serve as the cornerstone for developing next-generation renewable and sustainable energy systems, with key application areas including high-density energy storage, carbon capture, and low-energy water purification. However, the full realization of their potential depends on our ability to master the complex multiphase flow and heat transfer processes within their nanopores. At present, understanding the complex coupling mechanisms at these microscales remains a core challenge in this field. To address this challenge, this review aims to systematically sort out and summarize the current research status of the coupling mechanisms of multiphase flow and heat transfer in nanoporous media. The significance of this paper lies in providing researchers with a comprehensive knowledge framework and reference by in-depth analyzing experimental characterization technologies (such as in-situ electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc.), numerical simulation methods, and key regulation strategies. This paper is committed to clarifying the special laws of multiphase flow, the complexity of heat transfer mechanisms, and their coupling effects, aiming to provide solid theoretical guidance and innovative ideas for the design of new functional materials, the optimization of existing material properties, and related engineering applications. Relevant studies have shown that with proper regulation, heat and mass transfer efficiency can be improved by 10 %–30 %. This review focuses on commenting on various in-situ experimental technologies including scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and discusses the latest progress in multiscale research methods and numerical simulations. On this basis, the paper looks forward to future research directions, predicting the development of new nanoporous materials, the innovation of advanced experimental technologies, the breakthrough of multiscale modeling, and the application of artificial intelligence-assisted research methods. Ultimately, this study is expected to promote the progress of research on multiphase flow and heat transfer in nanoporous media and contribute to solving major scientific and engineering challenges.
