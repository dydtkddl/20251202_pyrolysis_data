Photocatalytic materials applicationsfor sustainable agriculture The pressure for more sustainable, environmentally friendly agriculture is a trend that affects its value chain in several levels, including the production of fertilizers, the management of pesticides and other chemicals, and solutions for the related greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, NOx, CH4, and CO2). Moreover, the search for value motivates novel routes to utilize biomass in chemical production, including sustainable fuels. These topics are interconnected to developing photocatalytic materials, i.e., those promoting reactions by light activation, primarily through the sunlight. Thus, this review summarizes the many efforts done to develop adequate materials for photocatalysis in the context of agriculture problems, discussing the recent advances and challenges for application in the real world.
