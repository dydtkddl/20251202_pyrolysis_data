You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a microwave thermogravimetric analyzer and its application on polystyrene microwave pyrolysis kinetics To study pyrolysis kinetics inside a microwave environment, a microwave thermogravimetric analyzer was developed. A sample mass as low as 0.3 g can be studied along with silicon carbide as the microwave receptor. The temperature is measured with a custom-made infrared thermopile equipped with different optical filters specific to this application. Validation of the microwave thermogravimetric analyzer features showed that the measured data can be used as is for kinetic development. Different heating profiles can be achieved by modulating the microwave power. The microwave thermogravimetric analyzer was then used for the kinetic development of polystyrene microwave pyrolysis. Polystyrene was chosen because of its low recycling rate and its great potential to produce high-valued products, like styrene. Three heating rates (24.5, 38.5 and 49.5 °C min−1) were used to estimate the kinetic parameters. By comparing several reaction models, a random scission model was found to best explain the experimental data. The choice of the reaction model was made based on two statistical tests: the coefficient of determination R 2 and the residual sum of squares RSS. With this reaction model, an activation energy of E = 45 kJ mol−1 and a pre-exponential constant of ln(A) = 3.6 were found for polystyrene microwave pyrolysis.
