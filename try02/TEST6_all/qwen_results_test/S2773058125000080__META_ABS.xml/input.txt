Strategies and technologies for sustainable plastic waste treatment and recycling Discarded plastics in natural environments contribute significantly to “white pollution” due to their high persistence and potential for bioaccumulation. Improperly managed waste plastics further exacerbate this issue by fragmenting and decomposing into microplastic contaminants, posing emerging threats. Effective strategies for managing and recycling discarded plastics are therefore imperative to mitigate environmental pollution and associated ecological and health risks. This review comprehensively summarizes current technologies for removing waste plastics from the environment, discussing their mechanisms, feasibility, and limitations. Methods such as pyrolysis, photolysis, electrochemical catalysis, and enzymatic processes are evaluated. Furthermore, existing technologies for transforming waste plastics into carbon materials, valuable chemicals, and fuels are outlined. Finally, the review offers insights and prospects for advancing technical developments in waste plastic management within environmental contexts.
