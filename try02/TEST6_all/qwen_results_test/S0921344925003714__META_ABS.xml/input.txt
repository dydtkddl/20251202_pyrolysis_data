Delamination of multilayer flexible packaging: a promising approach towards the recycling of their components. A review Multilayer/multimaterial films, widely used in flexible packaging, provide enhanced functionalities by combining polymeric and non-polymeric layers. However, the recycling of these films is particularly challenging because of their complex structure. Indeed, most waste currently end up in landfills or incinerators. This paper critically explores the rising interest in delamination technologies as a promising technique for recovering individual monomaterial layers, so enabling recycling and resource preservation. This review categorizes and evaluates the latest developments in delamination methods, such as acidic and alkaline treatments, switchable hydrophilic solvents, Diels-Alder chemistry, deep eutectic solvents, innovative adhesive systems, solvent combinations, and mechanical techniques. In conclusion, the potential of specific technologies for industrial scaling is emphasized, identifying present limits and suggesting directions for future research to improve performance, sustainability, and feasibility at larger scales.
