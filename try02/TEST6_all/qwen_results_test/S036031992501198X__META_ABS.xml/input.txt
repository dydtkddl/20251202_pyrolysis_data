Multi-criteria comparative review of renewable energy driven water-splitting hydrogen production technologies Hydrogen is key for zero emission scenarios and is producible using renewable components of water, plants, light, and renewable electricity and heat. Water-splitting Green or Clean Hydrogen Production (GCHP) technologies include electrolysis, photolysis, bio-photolysis, and thermolysis at different levels of technology readiness and commercialization. They face challenges and also provide opportunities for GCHP. These technologies are reviewed and compared from energy, exergy, economic, environmental, technological, and social viewpoints (4E-TS). Each technology is studied specifically, and it is also compared with its counterparts. Opportunities and challenges of each technology are highlighted and important guidelines are also given to improve the market and Social Acceptance of hydrogen. While technological development and cost competitiveness are prerequisites for commercializing water-splitting technologies, several other factors greatly impact the uptake of the technologies. These factors include the availability and affordability of renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks, as well as existing electricity and hydrogen infrastructure, the Capacity factor of renewable electricity and heat, the cost of renewable electricity and heat, integrating different technologies, and the impact of off-grid and on-grid scenarios, and the existing energy networks, Furthermore, the uptake of GCHP technologies require proper governance, policies, and regulations to stimulate demand for clean hydrogen.
