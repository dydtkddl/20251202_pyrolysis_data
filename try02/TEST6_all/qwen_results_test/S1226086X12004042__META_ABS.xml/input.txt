Structural and thermal characterization of macro-branched functional terpolymer containing 8-hydroxyquinoline moieties with enhancing biocidal properties Novel polyfunctional acetyl and hydroxyl bearing functional terpolymer (HQFCA) derived from 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ), 4-chloroacetophenone (CA) and formaldehyde (F) has been synthesized by complex condensation polymerization in the presence of an acid catalyst. The structure and morphology of terpolymer were elucidated by FTIR-ATR, one-dimensional NMR (1H NMR, 13C NMR and DEPT-135 experiment), two-dimensional NMR (HSQC and TOCSY), pyrolysis GC–MS, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), nitrogen absorption, and optical microscopy (OM). Principal pyrolysis products generated from HQFCA units were 8-hydroxy-5,6-dimethylquinoline, 8-hydroxy-2-methylquinoline and 4-chloroacetophenone. This reactive terpolymer can be used as synthons for exchange membrane preparation and biomedical coating applications.
