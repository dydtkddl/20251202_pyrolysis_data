You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Post-consumer textile thermochemical recycling to fuels and biocarbon: A critical review This study aims to look at waste-to-energy (tertiary recycling) of post-consumer textile waste, based on a literature review. Because textiles are mostly made of cotton and polyester, which are carbon and energy sources, they can potentially be converted thermochemically into fuels and biocarbon. The critical parameters determining thermal recycling are summarized and discussed with a focus on pyrolysis, gasification, and torrefaction. For cotton and polyester mixtures, torrefaction presents a low environmental impact and an energy-dense fuel that can be used in cogeneration systems, reducing the energy requirements of these processes by 50–85%. Catalytic pyrolysis of cotton textile waste yields to a high conversion (90 wt%), a liquid fuel of high yields (35–65 wt%), and biocarbon (10–18 wt%), providing carbon and energy closure loops. However, pyrolysis is energy-intensive (T > 500 °C) and produces hazardous chemicals from the conversion of PET, nylon, and polyacrylonitrile. Gasification can handle many types of textile waste, but it needs continuous monitoring of the emissions. More research is needed to overcome existing limitations, LCA and sustainability assessment are required for the thermal recycling processes in order to estimate their future-proofing and sustainability. For the transition to a circular economy, consumers' awareness of resources limits and sustainable use is pivotal to change purchasing behavior and achieve a recycling thinking.
