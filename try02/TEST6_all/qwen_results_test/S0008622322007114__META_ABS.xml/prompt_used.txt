You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-performance carbon molecular sieve membrane for C2H4/C2H6 separation: Molecular insight into the structure-property relationships Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes show attractive potential for energy-efficient separation of C2H4/C2H6 due to their unique slit-like pore structure. In this work, a novel precursor polymer of phenolphthalein-based poly(arylene ether ketone) (PEK-C) was introduced to prepare high-performance CMS membranes for C2H4/C2H6 separation. Molecular insight into the effect of the sp 3/sp 2 hybridized carbon ratio on the packing morphology of carbon layers, pore size and configuration, and C2H4/C2H6 diffusion and separation properties of CMS membranes was investigated via using in-depth characterization techniques combined with molecular simulations. Results show that the carbon layers with more sp 3 hybridized carbons lead to forming a loose and disordered carbon structure and pore structure with large pore volume and micropore size (steric voids), resulting in low C2H4/C2H6 permselectivity of CMS membrane. With the reduction of the sp 3/sp 2 hybridized carbon ratio, a compact and graphite-like carbon structure with the two-dimensional slit-like ultramicropore structure is formed, and the C2H4/C2H6 permselectivity is obviously enhanced. The CMS membranes derived from the novel precursor of PEK-C exhibit high C2H4 permeability with superior C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, which have surpassed the trade-off bounds of both polymeric membrane and CMS membrane, and reveal a great potential in the industrial applications of C2H4/C2H6 separation.
