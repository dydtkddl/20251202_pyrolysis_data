High-performance carbon molecular sieve membrane for C2H4/C2H6 separation: Molecular insight into the structure-property relationships Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes show attractive potential for energy-efficient separation of C2H4/C2H6 due to their unique slit-like pore structure. In this work, a novel precursor polymer of phenolphthalein-based poly(arylene ether ketone) (PEK-C) was introduced to prepare high-performance CMS membranes for C2H4/C2H6 separation. Molecular insight into the effect of the sp 3/sp 2 hybridized carbon ratio on the packing morphology of carbon layers, pore size and configuration, and C2H4/C2H6 diffusion and separation properties of CMS membranes was investigated via using in-depth characterization techniques combined with molecular simulations. Results show that the carbon layers with more sp 3 hybridized carbons lead to forming a loose and disordered carbon structure and pore structure with large pore volume and micropore size (steric voids), resulting in low C2H4/C2H6 permselectivity of CMS membrane. With the reduction of the sp 3/sp 2 hybridized carbon ratio, a compact and graphite-like carbon structure with the two-dimensional slit-like ultramicropore structure is formed, and the C2H4/C2H6 permselectivity is obviously enhanced. The CMS membranes derived from the novel precursor of PEK-C exhibit high C2H4 permeability with superior C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, which have surpassed the trade-off bounds of both polymeric membrane and CMS membrane, and reveal a great potential in the industrial applications of C2H4/C2H6 separation.
