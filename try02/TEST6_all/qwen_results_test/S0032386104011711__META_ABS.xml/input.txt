Adsorption of block copolymers at latex surface and their utilization in emulsion polymerization Amphiphilic block copolymers have been investigated for their utilization in emulsion polymerization of butyl methacrylate. Special attention has been paid to the adsorption mechanism of the block copolymers from systematic measurements of equilibrium adsorption isotherms. A series of well-defined water-soluble amphiphilic block copolymers, composed of poly(butyl methacrylate) and poly(sodium methacrylate) blocks, were synthesized by anionic polymerization of butyl methacrylate and tert-butyl methacrylate followed by the thermal deprotection of the tert-butyl ester groups and final hydrolysis. The number density of emulsion polymer particles N P varied as [copolymer]α, α lying between 0.44 and 0.73 according to the hydrophilic content of the copolymers. In contrast with SDS taken as a reference emulsifier, the adsorption of the copolymers was very strong and this provided quite an efficient stabilization of the polymer particles during emulsion polymerization, even at low concentrations (<10−4 molL−1) and low coverages (<10% of the interfacial area).
