You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cracking catalysts used as fluidized bed material in the Hamburg pyrolysis process The effects of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts as fluidized bed material on the pyrolysis of polystyrene and polyethylene were investigated at temperatures between 370 and 515°C in a scale of ∼1 kgh−1. The results were compared qualitatively with pyrolysis-GC-MS-experiments (200 μg). The catalytic influence on the product distribution is easily seen by the comparison to non-catalytic experiments with simple quartz sand. In the catalytic polystyrene pyrolysis, the product distribution is changed from the usual main product styrene (61 wt.%) to basic chemicals (18–26 wt.% ethylbenzene, 9–22 wt.% benzene, 1–7 wt.% styrene, 3–5 % toluene) and soot (15–23 wt.%). Surprisingly, it was shown that in the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene even at low temperatures (450–515°C) gases (48–52 wt.%) and low boiling aliphatic oils (38–39 wt.%) were received instead of waxes (∼90 wt.%) in non-catalytic experiments. A further success of the catalytic pyrolysis is a dramatic reduction of the process temperature. Pyrolysis-GC-MS-experiments confirmed these results qualitatively.
