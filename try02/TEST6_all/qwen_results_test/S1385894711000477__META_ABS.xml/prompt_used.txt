You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of mesophilic and thermophilic conditions on changes of physicochemical characteristics of smooth cordgrass via dry digestion process In this study, the changes on physicochemical characteristics of pretreated and digested smooth cordgrass were investigated by the composition, X-ray, FTIR and 13C NMR, and TG analyses. Simultaneous lime treatment and dry digestion could be successfully carried out in leaching bed reactor at thermophilic condition with highest breakage of lignocellulose and higher biogas yield. Comparing with mesophilic condition, thermophilic condition brought a greater change of lignocellulosic structure, thus making holocellulose more accessible to anaerobic bacteria and benefiting to biogas production. The removal of lignin and hemicellulose at pretreatment phase was shown by the cleavage of ester linkage or carbonyl groups and the reducing intensity of lignin from FTIR and 13C NMR spectra analysis. The removal of polysaccharide mainly happened at digestion phase, as shown by the results of composition, FTIR and 13C NMR analysis. The crystalline index obviously decreased at pretreatment and digestion phases, as indicated by the intensity change of hydrogen bonding. The results of TG analysis showed that pretreatment and digestion had an obvious impact on the distribution of volatile matter, rate of weight loss and kinetic parameters of pyrolysis.
