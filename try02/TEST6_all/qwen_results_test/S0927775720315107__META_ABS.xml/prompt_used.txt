You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhance the interaction between ammonium polyphosphate and epoxy resin matrix through hydrophobic modification with cationic latex The aim of this study is to improve the interaction between ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and epoxy resin (EP) matrix. The modified ammonium polyphosphate (MAPP) with hydrophobic property was prepared by the cationic latex via electrostatic interaction. The results showed that the hydrophobicity and thermal stability of MAPP were improved over APP. The increased hydrophobicity of MAPP facilitated its mixing efficiency with EP matrix and the mechanic property results of EP/MAPP composites supported an enhancement of interfacial interaction between MAPP and EP matrix. For example, the impact strength of EP/MAPP13.5 (13.5 wt part of APP per hundred EP matrix) was 15.58 kJ m−2, compared with 12.47 kJ m−2 of EP/APP13.5, while the tensile strength increased from 51.06 MPa of EP/APP13.5 to 61.76 MPa of EP/MAPP13.5. Such interfacial interaction improvement would assist the stress transfer and adsorption of impact energy. In addition, the MAPP showed little impact on the flame resistance properties of APP. For example, both EP/APP13.5 and EP/MAPP13.5 composites had V-0 grade in the vertical burning tests.
