You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lattice distortions and non-sluggish diffusion in BCC refractory high entropy alloys Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have emerged as promising candidates for extreme high-temperature applications, for example, in next-generation turbines and nuclear reactors. In such applications, atomic diffusion critically governs essential properties including creep resistance and microstructural stability. The present study systematically investigates impurity diffusion of Co, Mn, and Zn in single phase (BCC solid solution) HfTiZrNbTa and HfTiZrNbV RHEAs applying the radiotracer technique. A neutron total scattering technique is used to evaluate the pair distribution functions and element-specific lattice distortions in these alloys. Ab initio-based calculations give access to lattice distortions and solubilities of the impurities under investigation, including the impact of short-range order. The diffusion results are discussed in relation to calculated substitutional and interstitial solution energies, local lattice distortions, and short-range order effects. Co diffusion is found to be dominated by the interstitial mechanism, exhibiting fast diffusion. These findings reveal important structure–property relationships between local atomic environments and diffusion kinetics in BCC RHEAs, providing critical insights for designing alloys with enhanced high-temperature performance through targeted control of impurity diffusion processes.
