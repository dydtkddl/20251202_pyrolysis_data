You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multiscale molecular modeling can be an effective tool to aid the development of biomass conversion technology: A perspective Lignocellulosic biomass is an alternate and renewable source of carbon. However, due to high oxygen content and diverse functionality, its conversion to fuels and chemicals is technologically challenging. Since physico-chemical characteristics of biomass and its derived components are very different from petroleum, fundamental understanding of their interactions with catalysts and solvents and of their behavior during thermochemical processing needs to be developed. In the present paper, we provide a perspective on how multiscale molecular modeling can assist in developing the science of biomass processing. The scope of this paper is limited to liquid phase catalytic and pyrolytic conversion of biomass. Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD), a multiscale method that combines quantum mechanics and classical molecular dynamics and is an excellent choice to simulate biomass interactions in the condensed phase, is discussed. An overview of metadynamics, a method to accelerate CPMD dynamics, is also given. Revealing the chemistry of biomass pyrolysis, identifying liquid phase catalytic reaction mechanisms and developing a fundamental understanding of the role of solvents in biomass processing are the three main areas highlighted in this paper. Molecular modeling based investigations in these areas are reviewed and key findings are summarized. Limitations of the current approaches are discussed and the relevance of multiscale methods like CPMD and metadynamics is discussed. Potential studies that could implement multiscale molecular modeling methods to solve some of the challenging problems in developing biomass conversion technology are elaborated and an outlook is provided.
