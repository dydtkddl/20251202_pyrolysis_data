You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

ReaxFF MD study on the early stage co-pyrolysis of mixed PE/PP/PS plastic waste The early stage co-pyrolysis of typical plastic waste including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) were investigated by using the reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulation with an automatic reaction mechanism analysis software (AutoRMA); the kinetic model, product yields and reaction process of co-pyrolysis were analyzed at atomic level. The results show that the kinetic parameters of PE/PP/PS co-pyrolysis can be obtained through the weighted sum of the parameters for the fracture of C–C and C–H bonds; the estimated activation energy is very close to the experimental one with a small error of ±3.86%, indicating that the fracture of C–C and C–H bonds can accurately characterize the co-pyrolysis process. For the co-pyrolysis of PE-PP mixture, an increase of PP content can improve the yields of oil and combustible gas, whereas for the co-pyrolysis of PP-PS mixture, the increase of PS content can improve the yields of tar and oil. In contrast, for the co-pyrolysis of PE-PP-PS mixture, a higher temperature is beneficial for the conversion of heavy oil into light oil; the light oil content increases from 44.77% at 2400 K to 56.18% at 3000 K. In addition, as a higher temperature can promote the further cracking of light hydrocarbons into gas products of smaller molecules, the yields of H2 and CH4 increase significantly with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, whereas the yields of C2H4 and C3H6 increase first and then decrease with the temperature. In comparison with the separated pyrolysis, the co-pyrolysis commences later, but displays shorter time to reach the first equilibrium state and generates products with smaller molecules. For the separate pyrolysis of PE and PP, their monomers emerge first, hereafter the alkanes and small molecule gases are produced; for the co-pyrolysis process, in contrast, the alkanes and small molecule gases are generated prior to the monomers. Moreover, PS tends to provide ·H radicals in the co-pyrolysis process, which can combine with the free radicals generated from PE and PP pyrolysis, forming small molecule alkanes and H2.
