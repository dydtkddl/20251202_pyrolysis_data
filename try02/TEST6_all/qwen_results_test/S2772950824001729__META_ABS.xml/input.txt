Innovative biomaterials for food packaging: Unlocking the potential of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolyesters show a good balance between sustainability and performance, making them a competitive alternative to conventional plastics for ecofriendly food packaging. With an emphasis on developments over the last decade (2014–2024), this review examines the revolutionary potential of PHAs as a sustainable food packaging material option. It also delves into the current state of commercial development, competitiveness, and the carbon footprint associated with PHA-based products. First, a critical examination of the challenges experienced by PHAs in terms of food packaging requirements is undertaken, followed by an assessment of contemporary strategies addressing permeability, mechanical properties, and processing considerations. The various PHA packaging end-of-life options, including a comprehensive overview of the environmental impact and potential solutions will also be discussed. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives are elucidated with a view of prospecting PHAs as future green materials, with a blend of performance and sustainability of food packaging solutions.
