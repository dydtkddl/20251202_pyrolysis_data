You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on graphene-based materials: From synthesis to contemporary sensor applications Carbon based 2D materials, specifically those of the graphene family, recently gained considerable interest in the study of sensors. It is emerging as a novel and potent material with tunable physicochemical properties such as ballistic conduction, high mechanical strength, a broad spectrum of chemical stability, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, ease of surface functionalization, and the possibility of mass production. This review provides insights into recent advances in graphene-based materials for field-effect transistor-based sensors, electrochemical sensors, and Raman spectroscopy-based sensors. Among the sensing methodologies, those utilizing field-effect transistors demonstrate a high degree of specificity and ultralow sensitivity and are relatively easy to manufacture in large batches with a repeatable sensitivity. Over the last decade, multiple types of sensors based on various graphene-family materials have been researched to detect various types of targets, ranging from biomolecules to heavy metals and chemical pollutants. Owing to their ability to integrate into a portable and rapid test platform, both at the laboratory scale and for point-of-care testing, the graphene family of materials (GFM) is a significantly viable base for sensor fabrication. Electrochemical and Raman spectroscopy-based sensors can provide a robust platform for detection at high-stress environments including fluctuating pH, temperature, and other possible disturbing conditions. The strategies used by researchers to detect specific and ultralow concentrations of analytes in a diverse mixture of targets are elaborated in detail. This review chronologically presents details regarding the GFM ranging from their synthesis to specific application possibilities.
