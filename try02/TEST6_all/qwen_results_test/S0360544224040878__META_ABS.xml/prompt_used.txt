You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cleaner production of bio-oil from macroalgae and low-rank coal mixture by pyrolysis in a microwave reactor integrated with a distillation column In recent years, biofuels have advanced significantly, progressing from the first to the third generation. Macroalgae, a third-generation biofuel, provides distinct advantages over other biomass, such as abundant availability, minimal space requirements, and little to no competition with arable land. This study explores the cleaner production of bio-oil from a blend of Eucheuma cottonii macroalgae and low-rank coal (LRC) using microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) integrated with a distillation column. This integrated system enhance (C5-C12), kerosene (C12-C20), and diesel (C21-C38) fractions, suitable for various fuel applications. A 30 g mixture of macroalgae, LRC, and 2 wt% HZSM-5 catalyst was processed in MAP under vacuum (−10 mmH2O) to minimize oxygen content. Pyrolysis was conducted at 620 °C, with microwave power ranging from 0 to 800 W. Optimal conditions—a 1:1 macroalgae-to-coal ratio, 450 W microwave power, and a 135-min reaction time—produced a bio-oil yield of 61.7 wt%. FTIR and GC-MS analyses confirmed the bio-oil's wide hydrocarbon range and diverse functional groups, underscoring its potential across multiple fuel grades. While the process reduces carbon footprints by combining macroalgae's renewable properties with LRC's energy density, challenges such as high oxygen, ash, and sulfur contents require further refining processes like hydrotreatment. This study demonstrates the potential of MAP technology integrated with a distillation column as a scalable, sustainable biofuel production method, offering a promising pathway to cleaner energy solutions and global net-zero emission goals.
