You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of sewage sludge in a fixed and a bubbling fluidized bed – Estimation and experimental validation of the pyrolysis time Pyrolysis of sewage sludge was studied experimentally in a stainless-steel reactor operated as a fixed or fluidized bed. A novel measuring technique, consisting of measuring the mass of the whole reactor and the sample on a scale, was applied. The scale was capable of measuring the whole mass of the reactor with enough accuracy to detect the mass released by the sewage sludge sample during its pyrolysis. This original measuring technique permitted the measurement of the evolution over time of the mass of sewage sludge supplied to the bed in batch during its pyrolysis while moving freely in the bed. From the measurement of the mass of the solid residue remaining in the reactor, the pyrolysis time of the sewage sludge sample can be obtained accurately for each operating condition. Different operating conditions were selected to analyze the evolution with time of the sample mass during the pyrolysis process, including the bed temperature and the velocity of the Nitrogen used as inert gas. An increase of the velocity of Nitrogen from that of a fixed bed (0.8Umf ) to that of a low velocity bubbling fluidized bed (2.5Umf ) accelerates remarkably the pyrolysis process, i.e. reduces the pyrolysis time, however increasing the Nitrogen velocity further has a slight effect on the characteristic velocity of the pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis process of sewage sludge can also be accelerated by increasing the bed temperature, even though the effect of the temperature is lower than that of the Nitrogen velocity. Furthermore, a mathematical model based on a first order apparent kinetics for the pyrolysis of sewage sludge was proposed. The model was employed to estimate the pyrolysis time for each operating condition, obtaining a proper agreement with the experimental measurements.
