You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Promoting LDPE microplastic biodegradability: The combined effects of solar and gamma irradiation on photodegradation Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) is non-biodegradable and breaks down into microplastics (MP) when exposed to sunlight and weathering. This poses a threat to ecosystems, contributing to the micropollutants found in urban treated wastewater. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of solar and gamma irradiation on the biodegradability of LDPE MP. We pretreated them with simulated solar irradiation without (photolysis) and with (photocatalysis) TiO2 nanoparticles followed by gamma irradiation, leading to the appearance of cracks and roughness on the surface. Simultaneously, thermal stability decreased, and the carbonyl index and crystallinity increased, indicating oxidation and chain scission. Aerobic biodegradability was measured in a static respirometer at 58ºC, using green compost as inoculum, and proved to be effective for screening biodegradability of the pretreated LDPE. The combination of photocatalysis and gamma irradiation produced a synergistic effect on photodegradation, making it the most effective method for promoting biodegradation, revealed by the increased specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), which is expressed as millimoles O2 per mol of carbon per hour, and the greatest biodegradation kinetics constant (kO2=0.0178 h−1). The primary mechanism driving biodegradation involved the formation of carbonyl groups, which initiated biological activity.
