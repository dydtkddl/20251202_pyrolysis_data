You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastics pyrolysis: The impact of pyrolysis temperature on ethylene production and direct carbon dioxide footprint An attempt to estimate the energy and emissions for chemically recycling polyethylene is presented. The workflow includes an experimental section to generate pyrolysis decomposition data, and a process model to simulate the process. Pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatographic separation with mass spectrometric and flame ionization detection (Pyr-GC–MS/FID) was carried out at different temperatures, ranging from 600 to 800 °C on both low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pellets and linear low-density (LLDPE) pellets. The hydrocarbon composition of the pyrolyzed materials was determined using the MS data, while quantification was performed using the FID data. The quantified hydrocarbon composition was then used as the input data for modeling the pyrolysis reactor and separations process in Aspen Plus. The direct CO2 emissions were estimated for downstream chemical processes, such as pyrolysis oil hydroprocessing, steam cracking, and polymerization. The process analysis included the evaluation of scenarios where the pyrolysis plant was located in a stand-alone site and integrated with surrounding chemical plants. It was shown that higher pyrolysis temperatures create the possibility for collocating a pyrolysis plant with the steam cracker process.
