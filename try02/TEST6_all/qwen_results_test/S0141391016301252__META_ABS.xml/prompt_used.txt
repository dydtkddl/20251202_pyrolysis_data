You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of flame-retardant performance of thermoplastic polyurethane with the incorporation of aluminum hypophosphite and iron-graphene This article mainly studies synergistic flame retardant effects and smoke suppression properties of iron-graphene (IG) and aluminum hypophosphite (AHP) on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), AHP used as main flame retardants and IG used as synergistic agents. A high concentration of TPU/IG masterbatch was prepared by solution-blending method, and then TPU/AHP/IG composites were prepared by melt-blending method. Then, the flame retardant effects of all TPU composites were tested using limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL 94 test, cone calorimeter test (CCT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and thermogravimetric/fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-IR). Remarkably, with 0.25 wt% content of IG and 9.75 wt% content of AHP, sample reached UL 94 V-0 rating, and the LOI value increased by 31.5 vol%, pHRR value decreased by 90% and pSPR value decreased by 72%, etc. SEM images show that char residues become more complete and present lamellar structure. TG-IR data reveal that the incorporation of AHP and IG promoted the release of H2O and CO2, meanwhile reduced harmful gases release.
