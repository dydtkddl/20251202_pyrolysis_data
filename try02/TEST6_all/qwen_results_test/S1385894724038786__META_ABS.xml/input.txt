Hydrothermal hydrolysis of triglycerides: Tunable and intensified production of diglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acids This study focuses on utilizing subcritical and supercritical water technology to produce intensive and selective diglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acids. The water properties can be easily modified by adjusting pressure and temperature, which promotes an improving solubility of the triglycerides in water and a selective production of glycerides. Triacetin and sunflower oil were used as models for short and long-chain components, exploring a range of temperatures (250 to 400 °C), pressures (22.0 to 25.0 MPa), and reaction times (0.7 to 29 s). A conversion of 98.5 % of sunflower oil is reached at 375 °C and 25.0 MPa in 29 s. The resulting products are 16.3 % diglycerides, 27.9 % monoglycerides, 48.9 % fatty acids, and 5.3 % glycerol. On the other hand, only 13 % of the oil is hydrolyzed at 300 °C, 22.0 MPa, with a reaction time of 23.6 s. The main product at this condition was fatty acids with a yield of 3.7 %. Furthermore, a kinetic model was developed to obtain comprehensive kinetic parameters for both raw materials to evaluate their reactivity during hydrolysis. This study provides valuable insights into the hydrolysis kinetics and the most promising conditions to make valuable products like fatty acids, mono and diglycerides, and glycerol.
