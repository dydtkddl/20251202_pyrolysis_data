You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal hydrolysis of triglycerides: Tunable and intensified production of diglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acids This study focuses on utilizing subcritical and supercritical water technology to produce intensive and selective diglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acids. The water properties can be easily modified by adjusting pressure and temperature, which promotes an improving solubility of the triglycerides in water and a selective production of glycerides. Triacetin and sunflower oil were used as models for short and long-chain components, exploring a range of temperatures (250 to 400 °C), pressures (22.0 to 25.0 MPa), and reaction times (0.7 to 29 s). A conversion of 98.5 % of sunflower oil is reached at 375 °C and 25.0 MPa in 29 s. The resulting products are 16.3 % diglycerides, 27.9 % monoglycerides, 48.9 % fatty acids, and 5.3 % glycerol. On the other hand, only 13 % of the oil is hydrolyzed at 300 °C, 22.0 MPa, with a reaction time of 23.6 s. The main product at this condition was fatty acids with a yield of 3.7 %. Furthermore, a kinetic model was developed to obtain comprehensive kinetic parameters for both raw materials to evaluate their reactivity during hydrolysis. This study provides valuable insights into the hydrolysis kinetics and the most promising conditions to make valuable products like fatty acids, mono and diglycerides, and glycerol.
