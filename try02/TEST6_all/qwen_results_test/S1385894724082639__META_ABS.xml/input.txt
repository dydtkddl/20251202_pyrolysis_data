Synergistic effect of Co-MOF/epoxy modified tannic acid/ammonium polyphosphate on flame retardancy, anti-melt dripping and mechanical properties of polylactic acid Achieving flame retardancy and anti-dripping properties in polylactic acid (PLA) while preserving its mechanical integrity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel organic ligand rich in phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) was synthesized and coordinated with Co2+ions to form a cobalt-based metal–organic framework (Co-MOF) with a multilayer mesoporous structure, acting as an effective carbonization agent. This Co-MOF was then compounded with epoxy-modified tannic acid (eTA) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) to create a synergistic flame-retardant system for PLA (PLA/MAT). The Co-MOF provides numerous active sites for catalytic oxidation, promoting the formation of a uniform, hill-like expanded carbon layer. During pyrolysis, the Co-MOF and APP yield cobalt oxides and polyphosphates, which catalyze the dehydration of PLA and eTA, facilitating carbonization and forming a continuous, dense protective layer. Consequently, the PLA/MAT system exhibits both robust mechanical properties and excellent flame retardancy, as demonstrated by a limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 27.0 % and a UL-94 V-0 rating, with no melt dripping observed during combustion tests. This work offers a novel approach for enhancing the flame retardancy and anti-dripping performance of PLA, with potential applications in engineering, electronics, and the automotive industry.
