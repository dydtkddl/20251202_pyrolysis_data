You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

TiO₂-based photocatalytic degradation of microplastics in water: Current status, challenges and future perspectives Microplastics are a growing environmental concern due to their persistence, widespread presence in water bodies and uncertain toxic effects on ecosystems and humans. TiO₂-based photocatalysis has emerged as a promising method for degrading microplastics, yet its application is still largely confined to controlled laboratory settings. This review highlights recent developments in the photocatalytic degradation of common plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene terephthalate. The process involves generating reactive oxygen species, which initiate chain reactions that break down polymer chains into smaller byproducts. However, the lack of standardized protocols complicates the assessment of photocatalysis performance for microplastic degradation, especially in complex wastewater environments. Despite TiO₂’s advantages, including low cost and stability, its photocatalytic efficiency is often hindered by factors like low solar spectrum efficiency, mass transfer limitations, and charge recombination. These challenges result in low degradation rates and inconsistent outcomes. Further research is needed to improve photocatalyst design, reactor configurations and the standardization of degradation assessment techniques. Additionally, the potential formation of harmful byproducts raises concerns, requiring further investigation of their ecotoxicological impacts. When combined with other treatment methods, TiO₂ photocatalysis shows promise for addressing microplastic pollution and other emerging pollutants in water treatment.
