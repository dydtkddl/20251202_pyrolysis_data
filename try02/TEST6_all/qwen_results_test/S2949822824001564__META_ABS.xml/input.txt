Biochar-mediated synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite for the methanol-to-olefins reaction The present study reports the successful synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolites with high external specific surface area by using biochar as a hard template. The physicochemical properties of the biochars (originated from grass, tea and lignin) were studied using XRD, SEM EDX, FTIR and other characterization techniques. The results showed that biochars obtained from different plants, due to the differences in morphology, particle size, composition and surface functional groups, led to significant effects on the morphology and acidity of the zeolite crystals. These ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited a significantly improved performance in the Methano-To-Olefins (MTO) reaction. Indeed, the catalyst lifetime of parent ZSM-5 started to decline after 6 h, whilst ZSM-5 modified by Grass-C only suffered a loss in conversion after 10 h on stream (at 400 °C, WHSV=8 h−1).
