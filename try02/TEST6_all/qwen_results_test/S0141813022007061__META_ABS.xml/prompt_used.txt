You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structural characterization of lignin and lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) of sesame hull In the present study, lignin and lignin-carbohydrate complex (LCC) constituting the cell wall structure of sesame hulls were investigated to explore novel techniques of dehulling. Milled wood lignin (MWL), Björkman LCC, and acid-soluble LCC (LCC-AcOH) were extracted from sesame hulls and characterized by carbohydrate composition analysis, molecular weight analysis, UV–vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, thermal analysis, Py-GC/MS, 2D HSQC NMR, and 31P NMR. The results showed that rhamnose accounted for the largest proportion of the lignin and LCC fractions, followed by glucose. Björkman LCC had the largest molecular weight, MWL had the smallest molecular weight, and LCC-AcOH had the largest polydispersity index. The lignin of sesame hulls consisted of syringyl (S), guaiacyl (G), p-hydroxyphenyl (H), and caffeyl alcohol (C) units. The most abundant monomer was guaiacyl (G), followed by caffeyl alcohol (C). C-type lignin is a new type of lignin that is different from the three traditional lignin monomers. The major lignin-linked bonds in the MWL and LCC-AcOH were β-O-4′ and β-β′, and β-5′ bonds were present in the Björkman LCC. The major LCC chemical bonds in the three fractions were PhGly. These findings will provide the factual basis for exploring different dehulling methods to enhance the quality of sesame products.
