You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis and kinetic study of non-edible castor seeds into renewable liquid fuel and value-added chemicals Biomass is a promising renewable resource due to its availability, low processing cost, high conversion efficiency, and reduced life-cycle carbon emissions, making it a potential alternative to fossil fuels. However, the pyrolysis-derived pyrolytic oil typically suffers from poor quality, high viscosity, thermal instability, and corrosiveness, limiting its direct use as fuel. These drawbacks can be mitigated through catalytic upgrading. Thus, the present study investigates the kinetic behaviour and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of castor seeds using a semi-batch reactor at 550 °C, 50 °C min−1 heating rates and 100 mL min−1 nitrogen flow rate. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted at heating rates of 10, 30, and 50 °C min−1, applying Ozawa-Flynn-Wall, Friedman (FM), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Vyazovkin (VZ), Starink (STM), alongside the Criado model. The average apparent activation energies were determined as 174.69, 172.25, 173.53, 66.17, and 156.93 kJ mol−1 for OFW, KAS, STM, VZ, and FM, respectively. The Criado model confirmed that biomass decomposition follows a complex, multi-step reaction mechanism. Further, pyrolysis using ZSM-5 and ZnO catalysts enhanced pyrolytic oil yields from 49.82 wt% (thermal) to 55.52 wt% and 54.33 wt%, respectively. Catalyst inclusion also improved the carbon content (by 14.12 % for ZSM-5 and 12.19 % for ZnO), higher heating value (by 1.72 and 1.00 MJ kg−1), and pH (by 0.89 and 1.50). The resulting biochar exhibited 57.14 % carbon content, 36.23 % oxygen, 19.88 MJ kg−1 Higher heating value, and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 84.98 m² g−1. Overall, this study highlights the potential of castor seeds as a viable feedstock for sustainable fuel production through catalytic biomass valorisation.
