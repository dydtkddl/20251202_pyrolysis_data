You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermocatalytic co-pyrolysis of waste biomass and plastics: Studies of physicochemical properties, kinetics behaviour, and characterization of liquid product The thermocatalytic co-pyrolysis of pine wood and plastics (waste nitrile gloves (WNG) and polystyrene (PS)) into renewable liquid fuel was the focus of the current study. The pyrolysis test is executed in a semi-batch reactor at 600 °C, 80 °C min−1 heating rate, and 100 mL min−1 nitrogen flow rate. The waste plastics and MgO were mixed with PW at 10, 20, and 30 wt% loadings, respectively. The proximate, ultimate, HHV, bulk density, biochemical, extractive, TGA, FTIR, viscosity, density, acidity, and GC-MS methods were used to characterize the raw feeds and pyrolytic oil. The physicochemical analysis of raw feeds confirmed their suitability for use as pyrolysis feedstock. The maximum yield of co-pyrolytic oil is found to be 46.76 and 45.41 wt% for PW + WNG and PS, at 20 wt% however, 48.12 and 48.76 wt% is found to be at PW + PS (20 wt%)+MgO (20 wt%) and PW + WNG (20 wt%)+MgO (20 wt%) respectively. The characterization results of pyrolytic oil validated that co-pyrolytic oil provides an improved yield than the individual pyrolysis of raw feeds. In thermocatalytic co-pyrolytic oil, it was discovered that the viscosity, oxygen content, and moisture had all decreased, whereas the heating value, density, carbon content, and acidity had all significantly increased. FTIR examination of pyrolytic oil established the appearance of aromatics hydrocarbon and oxygenated products, whereas GC-MS results validated a substantial reduction in oxygenated components and an increased hydrocarbon percentage at 20 wt% mixing of waste plastics and catalyst.
