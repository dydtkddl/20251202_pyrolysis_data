You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics of a new type continuous two-stage pyrolysis of waste polyethylene Waste polyethylene (PE) was pyrolyzed in a continuous two-stage pyrolysis process having auger and fluidized bed reactors. The main aim of the study was to produce a pyrolysis gas containing high contents of olefins along with a clean pyrolysis oil at moderate reaction conditions. In the experiment, the temperatures of the auger and fluidized bed reactors were varied from 30 to 300 °C and from 653 to 736 °C, and a CaO hot filter was used to capture HCl liberated during pyrolysis. At elevated auger reactor temperatures, the PE molecules in the reactor shifted to higher vibrational energy states, resulting in the weakening of the CC bond of PE molecule. The PE melt leaving the auger reactor could finally be decomposed into short chains in the fluidized bed reactor. The total yield of ethene, propene, and 1,3-butadiene was 30–53 wt.%. The olefin yield increased with increasing auger reactor temperature. The highest gas (74.6 wt.%) and ethene (34.5 wt.%) yields were obtained when N2 was used as the fluidizing medium. Pyrolysis oil, whose yield was 15–38 wt.%, was mostly composed of aromatic hydrocarbons. The CaO hot filter could reduce the chlorine content in the pyrolysis oil to 66.5 ppm.
