You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solar pyrolysis tars treatment using oxidation processes – Efficiency and toxicity analysis This paper presents oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation as the methods for elimination of toxic activity of biomass pyrolysis liquids subjected to the environment – water. With the increasing interest in biomass pyrolysis-derived fuels and chemicals, there is still a need for determining the environmental impact of unwanted leakage of the pyrolysis liquids to the environment via inappropriate handling or containers damage and proposing adequate solutions to solve it. Tars from solar pyrolysis of three biomass types (waste straw – WS, wood chips – WC, and dried sewage sludge – DSS) were treated using selected oxidation processes (ozonation – O3, photolysis – UV, and photocatalysis – UV-TiO2). The decomposition of organic substances present in the tars was investigated by changing the absorbance (Abs), total organic carbon (TOC), and phenol index (PI). Tar solutions before and after treatment were also submitted to an ecotoxicological assessment. It was determined that the tars organic substances content depended on the type of biomass subjected to solar pyrolysis. The highest concentration of organics was denoted in the liquid products from the solar pyrolysis of the sewage sludge. The decomposition of organic substances took place in the process of photocatalysis and ozonation, with higher effectiveness of the latter. The organic compounds present in the solar pyrolysis tar depend on the biomass feedstock. After 60 min of photocatalysis (TiO2 dose 1500 mg/L), phenolic compounds from tars coming from the solar pyrolysis of waste straw and wood chips were completely removed. In turn, the reduction in Abs and TOC was 37 and 19% for WS and 41 and 28% for WC, respectively. Abs in tars from the solar pyrolysis of sewage sludge in the photocatalysis process did not change, and the reduction of TOC and PI was 8 and 86%, respectively. However, the toxicity of post-process solutions requires attention. Tar solutions from the solar pyrolysis of wood chips after the photocatalysis process were non-toxic against bacteria, but tar solutions coming from the solar pyrolysis of waste straw and sewage sludge were low-toxic and toxic. Additionally, tars from the solar pyrolysis of sewage sludge after the photocatalysis process were highly toxic to crustaceans.
