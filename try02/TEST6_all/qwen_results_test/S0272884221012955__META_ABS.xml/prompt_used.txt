You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of pyrolytic carbon on carburization strengthening and corrosion of 3YSZ hollow fiber membranes Carbon species incorporation and carbon deposits are common in the manufacture process and application of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramics, while the potential corrosion induced by the resultant carburization is unclear. The 3YSZ hollow fiber membranes were prepared by wet spinning method. A sintering procedure at 1300–1450 °C under 0.02 MPa oxygen partial pressure, and thereafter an oxidation treatment at 800 °C were applied to investigate the carbothermal reaction and carburization corrosion mechanism. It was found that the trace carbon species of 1.0–2.2 mol% derived from polymeric precursors triggered the carburizing strengthening of porous YSZ membranes without sacrificing porosity and deformability. However, the carburization corrosion also occurred at the mild oxidation treatment, resulting in deterioration in bending strength and integrated structure converting into fine grains. Raman spectra, XPS bands and HR-TEM images confirmed that the in-situ synthesized ZrCxOy oxidized into monoclinic ZrO2, and micro-cracking formed along grain boundaries, which led to substantial mechanical strength loss.
