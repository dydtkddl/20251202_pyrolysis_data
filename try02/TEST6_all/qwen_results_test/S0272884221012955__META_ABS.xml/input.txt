Effects of pyrolytic carbon on carburization strengthening and corrosion of 3YSZ hollow fiber membranes Carbon species incorporation and carbon deposits are common in the manufacture process and application of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramics, while the potential corrosion induced by the resultant carburization is unclear. The 3YSZ hollow fiber membranes were prepared by wet spinning method. A sintering procedure at 1300–1450 °C under 0.02 MPa oxygen partial pressure, and thereafter an oxidation treatment at 800 °C were applied to investigate the carbothermal reaction and carburization corrosion mechanism. It was found that the trace carbon species of 1.0–2.2 mol% derived from polymeric precursors triggered the carburizing strengthening of porous YSZ membranes without sacrificing porosity and deformability. However, the carburization corrosion also occurred at the mild oxidation treatment, resulting in deterioration in bending strength and integrated structure converting into fine grains. Raman spectra, XPS bands and HR-TEM images confirmed that the in-situ synthesized ZrCxOy oxidized into monoclinic ZrO2, and micro-cracking formed along grain boundaries, which led to substantial mechanical strength loss.
