You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fine-tuning Cu–Co–Ce oxidation activity interface by unique microwave electromagnetic loss for boosting CO preferential oxidation in H2 steam Construction of composite metal interfaces with synergistic catalysis is an important research field for CO preferential oxidation in H2 steam (CO-PROX). Microwave electromagnetic loss can effectively compensate the thermal action on the active interface derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein, a trimetallic CuCoCe-MOF is derived to construct Cu–Co–Ce oxidation active interface oriented by magnetic, conduction and relaxation loss, which inhibit the high temperature deactivation due to sintering. Equipped with the tandem microwave pyrolysis, the intermediate CuCoCe/C fully exposes electromagnetic characteristic and heterogeneous interfaces. Subsequently, microwave strengthened CuCoCeOx exhibits an excellent CO-PROX activity window with the more than 85% CO conversion within 80–210 °C. Besides, in-situ Raman and in-situ DRIFTs investigations demonstrate that the equilibrium of active interfacial oxygen vacancy via hydrogen is crucial for the temperature window broadening of CO-PROX. This work provides a route for the efficient conversion of microwave electromagnetic energy to enhance the active interface for synergistic catalysis.
