MOF derivatives anchored to multichannel hollow carbon fibers with gradient structures for corrosion resistance and efficient electromagnetic wave absorption With the rapid development of 5G technology and the interconnection of industrial production, electromagnetic pollution has become a serious problem. Achieving lightweight and controllable loads of absorbers while obtaining corrosion-resistant absorbers with high electromagnetic response properties is still considered a huge challenge. In this work, carbon fiber with a multichannel hollow structure is obtained by PAN/PS hybrid electrospinning and subsequent high-temperature roasting process. The spatial structure inside the carbon fiber plays an active role in optimizing the impedance matching characteristics of the absorber. In addition, bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives are obtained by a precisely controlled ion exchange as well as a high-temperature gas-phase selenization process. The resulting introduction of a non-homogeneous interface induces interfacial polarization and improves the absorption behavior of the absorber. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance can be effectively enhanced due to the mechanisms of interface polarization and dipole polarization. The prepared NiSe/ZnSe/MHCFs composite can obtain excellent EMW absorption properties in C, X, and Ku bands by adjusting the thickness. Structural design and component modulation play a crucial role in realizing the strong absorption and wide bandwidth of the absorber. Radar cross-section calculations indicate that NiSe/ZnSe/MHCFs have tremendous potential in practical military stealth technology. And the prepared composite coating can provide periodic corrosion resistance to Q235 steel sheet when dealing with complex and extreme environments.
