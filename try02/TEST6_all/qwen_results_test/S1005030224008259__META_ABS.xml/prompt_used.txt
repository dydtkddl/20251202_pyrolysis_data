You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MOF derivatives anchored to multichannel hollow carbon fibers with gradient structures for corrosion resistance and efficient electromagnetic wave absorption With the rapid development of 5G technology and the interconnection of industrial production, electromagnetic pollution has become a serious problem. Achieving lightweight and controllable loads of absorbers while obtaining corrosion-resistant absorbers with high electromagnetic response properties is still considered a huge challenge. In this work, carbon fiber with a multichannel hollow structure is obtained by PAN/PS hybrid electrospinning and subsequent high-temperature roasting process. The spatial structure inside the carbon fiber plays an active role in optimizing the impedance matching characteristics of the absorber. In addition, bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives are obtained by a precisely controlled ion exchange as well as a high-temperature gas-phase selenization process. The resulting introduction of a non-homogeneous interface induces interfacial polarization and improves the absorption behavior of the absorber. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance can be effectively enhanced due to the mechanisms of interface polarization and dipole polarization. The prepared NiSe/ZnSe/MHCFs composite can obtain excellent EMW absorption properties in C, X, and Ku bands by adjusting the thickness. Structural design and component modulation play a crucial role in realizing the strong absorption and wide bandwidth of the absorber. Radar cross-section calculations indicate that NiSe/ZnSe/MHCFs have tremendous potential in practical military stealth technology. And the prepared composite coating can provide periodic corrosion resistance to Q235 steel sheet when dealing with complex and extreme environments.
