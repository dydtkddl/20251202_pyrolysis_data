You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate by using ferroferric oxide supported on carbon/UV/US system: A new approach into catalytic degradation of bisphenol A In the present research, a new method of sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation process was developed for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA). In this regard, magnetite nanoparticles supported on carbon (MNPs@C), as a heterostructure catalyst was combined with UV light and ultrasound (US) irradiation to efficient activate peroxymonosulfate (MNPs@C/UV/US/PMS). Several parameters affecting the degradation efficiency including pH, reaction time, different concentrations of catalyst, BPA and PMS, US power and water matrix components were studied. BPA degradation rate was considerably enhanced when US and UV irradiations were applied simultaneously with MNPs@C for activate PMS. A possible oxidation mechanism and reaction pathway for BPA degradation was proposed. Under optimized conditions, complete removal of BPA was obtained while the mineralization degree was only 56.4%. Toxicity tests with activated sludge demonstrate that MNPs@C/UV/US/PMS system could be improved the biodegradability of the solution. The quenching experiments proved that both OH and SO4 − radicals participate significantly during the degradation of BPA and sulfate radicals were dominant species. The MNPs@C also show a high synergistic effect (42.6%) on the BPA degradation in the presence of the other used agents during MNPs@C/UV/US/PMS system. IOUR decreased substantially after 60min treatment, confirming the toxicity of intermediates eliminated by process. The catalytic performance in degrade BPA was decreased at the presence of anions follows the order of HCO3 − >H2PO4 − >NO3 − >SO4 2− >Cl−. Cycling tests indicate the MNPs@C was reusable to activate PMS for degrade BPA for six consecutive cycles and the removal efficiency still remains at 95.2%. Overall, these results reveal that the activation of PMS by MNPs@C/UV/US system is an efficient and promising advances oxidation technology for the treatment of BPA-contaminated waters and wastewaters.
