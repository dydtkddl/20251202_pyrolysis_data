Recent advances in hybrid organic-inorganic materials with spatial architecture for state-of-the-art applications Owing to their unique properties, hybrid organic–inorganic (HOI) materials with a variety of spatial architectures have emerged as potential candidates for state-of-the-art applications. This overview describes the formation mechanism of HOI materials, including chemical synthesis approaches, and their functional performance, which could be controlled using structural and compositional designs. We outline the current methods used to synthesize HOI materials via solution–based processes and chemical deposition. The scientific principles, including the reaction mechanisms of the organic and inorganic components and computational perspectives are included. The role of molecular self–assembly is also discussed. We highlight a couple of novel strategies for the construction of three-dimensional HOI materials where functional organic compounds are combined with metal ions and porous inorganic materials. The protective characteristics are summarized and their structural reliability either corrosive or flammable environments is higlighted. In addition, the most important applications for catalysis, energy storage devices, and biomedical purposes, which were attributed to the functional properties coferred by the architecture and composition of HOI materilas are reviewed.
