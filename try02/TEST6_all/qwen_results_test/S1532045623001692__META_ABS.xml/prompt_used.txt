You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Toxicity assessment of environmental MPs and NPs and polystyrene NPs on the bivalve Corbicula fluminea using a multi-marker approach Small plastic particles, microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) represent a major threat in aquatic environments. Freshwater organisms are exposed to MPs and NPs, particularly in industrial and urban areas. The present study aimed to compare the toxicity between polystyrene NPs (PS NPs) and environmental microplastics (ENV MPs) and nanoplastics (ENV NPs) generated from macro-sized debris collected in the Garonne River on the freshwater bivalve C. fluminea. The organisms were exposed to the different plastic particles at three environmentally relevant concentrations: 0.008, 10, and 100 μg L−1 for 21 days. The biological responses of organisms were assessed using a multi-biomarker approach from the sub-individual to the individual level. The results demonstrated that: i) ENV NPs triggered more effects on detoxification processes and immune response, confirming that using manufactured NPs for laboratory exposure can lead to misleading conclusions on the risks posed by plastic particles; ii) effects of ENV MPs were less marked than ENV NPs, emphasizing the importance of testing a size continuum of plastic particles from NPs to MPs; iii) some effects were only observed for the low and/or intermediate concentrations tested, underlining the importance of using environmentally relevant concentrations. In light of these results, laboratory studies should be continued by exposing aquatic species to environmental MPs and NPs. The properties of these particles have to be characterized for a better risk assessment of environmental plastic particles.
