You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prospective energy content assessment of waste biomass and polymer via preliminary analysis Energy generation from waste biomass offers a promising solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a circular economy. This study investigates the energy potential of various organic materials, including rice husk, soybean, lemon myrtle, waste coffee ground, and empty fruit bunch, co-pyrolysed with HDPE at 500 °C and 50:50 blending ratio for 1 h. Proximate, ultimate, and thermogravimetric analyses were conducted up to 700 °C to determine elemental composition and thermal behaviour. Dulong's formula, modified Dulong's formula, and Vandralek's equation were utilised to assess energy content. Proximate analysis revealed rice husk as the highest in volatile matter (73.08 %), while waste coffee ground had the lowest (32.0 %), and HDPE showed 89.90 %. Ultimate analysis showed organic waste carbon ranges from 25.59 % to 48.75 %, and HDPE at 82.24 %. Pyrolysis reactions yielded distinct distributions of bio-oil, char, and gas, with empty fruit bunch producing the highest oil percentage (26.49 %), lemon myrtle yielding the highest gas (31.07 %), and waste coffee ground favouring char production (74.89 %). Discrepancies in heating values were observed, with Dulong's formula underestimating values for rice husk, soybean, and waste coffee ground (−10 % to −35 %) and slightly overestimating for lemon myrtle, empty fruit bunch, and HDPE (1 %–25 %). The modified Dulong formula accentuated underestimations, particularly for soybean (−451 %). The Vandralek formula showed positive error ranges (8 %) for biomass samples but underestimated HDPE. This study underscores biomass and HDPE as viable alternatives to conventional energy sources and suggests avenues for future research while highlighting environmental benefits.
