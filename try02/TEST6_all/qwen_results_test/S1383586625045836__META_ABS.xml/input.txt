Fabrication of Fe-N-P co-doped biochar for enhanced adsorption of bisphenol a from aqueous solutions The widespread detection of endocrine-disrupting compounds bisphenol A (BPA) in aquatic systems has raised serious environmental and public health concerns, emphasizing the urgent need for efficient and stable adsorbents for water purification. In this study, Fe-N-P co-doped biochar was synthesized from poplar wood through a synergistic co-doping method utilizing FeCl3 and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as sources of iron and nitrogen‑phosphorus, respectively. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and doping ratios on the textural characteristics and adsorption performance was comprehensively assessed. The optimized sample, PWFe1NP1–800, fabricated at 800 °C, demonstrated a peak BPA adsorption capacity of 95.2 mg·g−1, surpassing unmodified biochar and singly or doubly doped variants. Analysis of adsorption kinetics and isotherms revealed that BPA elimination adhered to the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models, affirming monolayer chemisorption as the predominant mechanism. PWFe1NP1–800 also exhibited exceptional regeneration stability, preserving over 85 % of its adsorption efficacy after five consecutive cycles. Mechanistic inquiries unveiled that the uptake of BPA was predominantly steered by π-π interactions, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, surface complexation, and pore filling. This investigation illustrated that Fe-N-P multi-element co-doping represents an efficient approach to amplify the structural functionality and adsorption effectiveness of biochar. The outcomes furnished novel perspectives on the systematic design of high-performance, versatile biochars for eliminating emerging organic contaminants from liquid environments.
