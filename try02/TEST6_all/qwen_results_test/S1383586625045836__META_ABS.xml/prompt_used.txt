You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of Fe-N-P co-doped biochar for enhanced adsorption of bisphenol a from aqueous solutions The widespread detection of endocrine-disrupting compounds bisphenol A (BPA) in aquatic systems has raised serious environmental and public health concerns, emphasizing the urgent need for efficient and stable adsorbents for water purification. In this study, Fe-N-P co-doped biochar was synthesized from poplar wood through a synergistic co-doping method utilizing FeCl3 and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) as sources of iron and nitrogen‑phosphorus, respectively. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and doping ratios on the textural characteristics and adsorption performance was comprehensively assessed. The optimized sample, PWFe1NP1–800, fabricated at 800 °C, demonstrated a peak BPA adsorption capacity of 95.2 mg·g−1, surpassing unmodified biochar and singly or doubly doped variants. Analysis of adsorption kinetics and isotherms revealed that BPA elimination adhered to the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models, affirming monolayer chemisorption as the predominant mechanism. PWFe1NP1–800 also exhibited exceptional regeneration stability, preserving over 85 % of its adsorption efficacy after five consecutive cycles. Mechanistic inquiries unveiled that the uptake of BPA was predominantly steered by π-π interactions, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction, surface complexation, and pore filling. This investigation illustrated that Fe-N-P multi-element co-doping represents an efficient approach to amplify the structural functionality and adsorption effectiveness of biochar. The outcomes furnished novel perspectives on the systematic design of high-performance, versatile biochars for eliminating emerging organic contaminants from liquid environments.
