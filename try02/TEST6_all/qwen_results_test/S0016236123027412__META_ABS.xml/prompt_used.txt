You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Self-assembly kieselguhr-based ZSM-5 for catalytic pyrolysis of mask waste to produce high value-added aromatics The conversion of plastic waste to high value-added aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) through catalytic pyrolysis offers huge untapped opportunities for resource recovery and plastic pollution control. Economical equipment configuration, operation and maintenance, high safety factor, high efficiency, stability, low-cost catalyst synthesis design, high yield, high selectivity of products are the key to the practical application of catalytic pyrolysis. In present study, low-cost kieselguhr based ZSM-5 was synthesized by one-pot in situ hydrothermal method using kieselguhr as silicon-aluminum source. During the depolymerization-recrystallization process, the selective growth and self-assembly of crystals on the a, c axis formed large-grain of ZSM-5 with extended straight channels and maximized sinusoidal channels. Native transition and alkaline-earth metals were coordinated to the acidic sites of the silica-aluminum skeleton, achieving tunability of the catalyst acidity. Catalytic pyrolysis of mask waste at 550 °C in a fixed bed reactor achieved the highest pyrolysis oil yield (44.3 wt%) and BTEX selectivity (77.1 %) with p-xylene as the dominant xylene product (78.2 %). After 3 cycles of long-life experiments, the BTEX selectivity of the catalyst remained at 65.1 %, which is higher than that of commercial ZSM-5 (54.9 %), indicating the superior use stability. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the excellent shape-selectivity of the catalyst is based on its unique pore structure, which facilitates the diffusion and transport of appropriately sized intermediates/products within the structure, resulting in products with advantageous distributions. This study proposes an efficient and feasible plastic closed-loop strategy for green upgrading of medical waste to high value-added chemicals.
