Organo-functionalization of polyvinyl cyanide for sorption of 152+154Eu-citrate chelates This study applied radiation-induced polymerization to synthesize cetrimonium bromide-functionalized polyvinyl cyanide (CBFPVC). This polymeric material was utilized as an adsorbent for 152+154Eu(III)-citrate anionic complexes from aqueous solutions. The effects of various parameters such as sample mass, equilibrium time, solution pH, and the citrate-to-Eu(III) ratio were studied under static conditions. The synthesized sorbent effectively removed the investigated Eu(III)-citrate chelates from their aqueous solutions with only few minutes needed to attain equilibrium. At [citrate]/[Eu(III)] molar ratio of 2:1, 90 % of the Eu(III)-citrate was sorbed onto CBFPVC at pH 10 in the first hour of contact. The sorption data is best with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating chemisorption. The experimental sorption equilibrium data were analyzed using a variety of isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich), and the first one exhibited the best alignment. The calculation of thermodynamic parameters (ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°) indicates that the sorption process was endothermic, favorable, and spontaneous. Several desorbing agents were used to study the desorption of Eu(III)-citrate from the loaded sample and Na2SO4 solution produced the highest recovery.
