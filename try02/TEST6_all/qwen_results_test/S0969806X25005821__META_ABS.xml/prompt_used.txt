You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Organo-functionalization of polyvinyl cyanide for sorption of 152+154Eu-citrate chelates This study applied radiation-induced polymerization to synthesize cetrimonium bromide-functionalized polyvinyl cyanide (CBFPVC). This polymeric material was utilized as an adsorbent for 152+154Eu(III)-citrate anionic complexes from aqueous solutions. The effects of various parameters such as sample mass, equilibrium time, solution pH, and the citrate-to-Eu(III) ratio were studied under static conditions. The synthesized sorbent effectively removed the investigated Eu(III)-citrate chelates from their aqueous solutions with only few minutes needed to attain equilibrium. At [citrate]/[Eu(III)] molar ratio of 2:1, 90 % of the Eu(III)-citrate was sorbed onto CBFPVC at pH 10 in the first hour of contact. The sorption data is best with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating chemisorption. The experimental sorption equilibrium data were analyzed using a variety of isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich), and the first one exhibited the best alignment. The calculation of thermodynamic parameters (ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS°) indicates that the sorption process was endothermic, favorable, and spontaneous. Several desorbing agents were used to study the desorption of Eu(III)-citrate from the loaded sample and Na2SO4 solution produced the highest recovery.
