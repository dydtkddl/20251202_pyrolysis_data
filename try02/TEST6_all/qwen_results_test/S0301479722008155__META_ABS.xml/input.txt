Potential and current practices of recycling waste printed circuit boards: A review of the recent progress in pyrometallurgy Over the last few decades, a substantial amount of e-waste including waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) has been produced and is accumulating worldwide. More recently, the rate of production has increased significantly, and this trend has raised some serious concerns regarding the need to develop viable recycling methods. The presence of other materials in the WPCBs, such as ceramics and polymers, and the multi-metal nature of WPCBs all contribute to the increased complexity of any recycling process. Among the viable techniques, pyrometallurgy, with the inherent ability to process the waste independent of its composition, is a promising candidate for both rapid and large-scale treatment. In the present study, firstly, the principles of the pyrometallurgical methods for WPCB recycling are discussed. Secondly, the different unit operations of thermochemical pretreatment including incineration, pyrolysis, and molten salt processing are reviewed. Thirdly, the smelting processes for the recovery of metals from WPCBs, as well as the issues surrounding slag formation and subsequent treatment are explained. Fourthly, alternative methods for the recovery of polymers and ceramics, in addition to metal recycling, are elucidated. Fifthly, emission control techniques and the potential for energy recovery are evaluated.
