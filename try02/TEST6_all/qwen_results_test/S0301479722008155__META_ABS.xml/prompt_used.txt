You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential and current practices of recycling waste printed circuit boards: A review of the recent progress in pyrometallurgy Over the last few decades, a substantial amount of e-waste including waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) has been produced and is accumulating worldwide. More recently, the rate of production has increased significantly, and this trend has raised some serious concerns regarding the need to develop viable recycling methods. The presence of other materials in the WPCBs, such as ceramics and polymers, and the multi-metal nature of WPCBs all contribute to the increased complexity of any recycling process. Among the viable techniques, pyrometallurgy, with the inherent ability to process the waste independent of its composition, is a promising candidate for both rapid and large-scale treatment. In the present study, firstly, the principles of the pyrometallurgical methods for WPCB recycling are discussed. Secondly, the different unit operations of thermochemical pretreatment including incineration, pyrolysis, and molten salt processing are reviewed. Thirdly, the smelting processes for the recovery of metals from WPCBs, as well as the issues surrounding slag formation and subsequent treatment are explained. Fourthly, alternative methods for the recovery of polymers and ceramics, in addition to metal recycling, are elucidated. Fifthly, emission control techniques and the potential for energy recovery are evaluated.
