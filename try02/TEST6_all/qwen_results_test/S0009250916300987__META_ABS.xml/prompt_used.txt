You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Model of transport and chemical kinetics in a solar thermochemical reactor to split carbon dioxide Solar thermochemical reactors to carry out the nonstoichiometric reduction and oxidation of cerium dioxide (ceria) to split water and carbon dioxide provide a pathway to store sunlight in a chemical fuel. One of the challenges in the design of these reactors is understanding the complex coupling of heat and mass transfer and redox chemistry. To elucidate this coupling, we present a three-dimensional, transient model of a recently developed prototype solar reactor that implements an isothermal, pressure-swing ceria redox cycle. Radiative transport is modeled by a hybrid Monte Carlo/finite volume approach and paired with the transport and chemical processes within a fixed bed of porous ceria particles. Morphology specific reaction rate coefficients for the gas–solid reactions in ceria are extracted for the first time from global rate measurements in a bench-top reactor at 1773K. Results demonstrate the interdependent spatial and temporal variations in temperature, species concentration and reaction rates, and provide insight on the effects of optical properties on reactor performance. For a solar input of 4.2kW, the reactor achieves nearly isothermal cycling at 1791K with carbon monoxide produced continuously at 3.6×10−4 mols−1. At this temperature, global reaction rates are driven by advective mass transport rates and the intrinsic material thermodynamics. Predicted surface temperatures and fuel production rates compare favorably to measured data.
