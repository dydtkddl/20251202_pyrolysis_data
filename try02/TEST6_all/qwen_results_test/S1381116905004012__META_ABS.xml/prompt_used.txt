You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of the urea–matrix combustion method on the HDS performance of Ni-MoS2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts A detailed study has been made of the different steps involved upon the preparation of γ-Al2O3-supported Ni-Mo HDS catalyst precursors by urea–matrix combustion (UMxC) method. Catalyst performance was evaluated using a tubular fixed-bed reactor and the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene under normal pressure as a model reaction. The oxidic and sulfurized states of the HDS catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in order to correlate their oxidic and sulfurized properties with the catalytic behaviour. During the UMxC process several consecutive stages such as melting, dissolution and chemical reactions occurred. There was no evidence of residual carbon and well-dispersed Ni- and Mo-oxo-species supported on alumina were formed. Urea employed as fuel not only increases the combustion rate, but also undergoes a decomposition process (endothermic reaction) that could contribute to the reduction of the combustion temperature. The urea–matrix combustion method permit to synthesize highly active γ-Al2O3-supported Ni-Mo HDS catalysts with a comparable promoter effect than that of corresponding catalyst prepared by impregnation method. In addition, an opposite relation between the activity and the hydrogenation properties was observed indicating that highly active HDS catalyst requires low consumption of hydrogen. Finally, both the ignition temperature and the urea-oxidizer ratio produce no significant changes in the HDS catalytic properties of Ni-Mo-based catalysts.
