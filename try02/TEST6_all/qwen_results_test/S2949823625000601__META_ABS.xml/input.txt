Review for the synergistic effects in catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste: Pathways to sustainable energy To address the growing need for renewable chemicals and fuels, finding alternatives to petroleum-based products is essential. One innovative solution is the catalytic co-pyrolysis of microalgae biomass with other waste feedstocks. This study focuses on co-pyrolysis to produce renewable chemicals from microalgae biomass with other waste feedstocks. The study investigates the transformation of bio-oil and biochar into useful products and evaluates their potential in chemical production. The study also looks at the characteristics of algal biomass and other feedstocks, and how they influences the co-pyrolysis outcomes. Additionally, it includes kinetic analyses and reaction pathways to gain insights into the complex chemical transformations during co-pyrolysis, revealing underlying reaction mechanisms. This approach not only enhances our understanding of microalgae with other waste feedstocks interactions during pyrolysis, but also highlights their significant implications for waste management and materials synthesis. By consolidating these aspects into a unified framework, the study outlines the challenges and future directions in this field, positioning catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) as a promising avenue for sustainable energy production and improved waste management practices.
