Chemosystematic studies of Devonian coal-forming plants: Barzas Orestovia-like plants compressions Orestovia-like plants are of great scientific and practical interest for various fields of natural science, forming the most ancient unique Devonian Barzas coals in the Kuznetsk Basin, Russia. However their natural affinity (higher plants or algae) remains disputable. This work studies Barzas compressions of Orestovia-like plants from the standpoint of chemosystematics. We proposed to use the aromatic biopolymer lignin, which is included in all higher terrestrial plants, as a marker of organic matter. To prove the presence of lignin and establish its structure, a complex of physical and chemical methods was used: FTIR and EPR spectroscopy, pyrolytic gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence and X-ray phase analysis. Based on the obtained results, we found the presence of transformation products of compositionally homogeneous p-coumaric protolignin in the substance of plant remains. The obtained data do not exclude the validity of the hypothesis that the Devonian Orestovia-like plants belong to higher plants.
