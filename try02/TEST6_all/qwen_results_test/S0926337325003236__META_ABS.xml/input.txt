Sustainable production of carbon nanotubes from plastic pyrolysis using Ni- and Fe-biochar catalysts synthesized via hydrothermal treatment The pyrolysis-catalytic decomposition process has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing plastic pollution by upcycling plastic waste into high-value carbon nanomaterials (CNMs). Traditional biochar-based catalysts face challenges in CNMs yield and carbon species. This study introduces Ni- and Fe-loaded biochar catalysts synthesized via hydrothermal (HT) treatment for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen production. The Ni/BC-24HT catalyst at 800 °C achieved the highest CNT yield (608 mg/gPS) and H2 selectivity (80.5 vol%, 23.1 mmol/gPS), surpassing wet impregnation (WI) catalysts and overcoming biochar’s limitations in CNT production. HT synthesis enhances inherent metal dispersion by replacing native minerals through ion exchange, effectively purifying the biochar catalyst by removing inherent metals while simultaneously incorporating the active metal onto the support, thereby improving catalytic performance. Ni and Fe3C in spent catalysts confirm CNT growth via surface/interface diffusion for Ni/BC-24HT and bulk diffusion for Fe/BC-24HT, explaining the higher CNT yield in Ni-loaded catalysts. Recycling tests demonstrated structural stability over five cycles, indicating durability and potential for extended applications with appropriate regeneration strategies.
