You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Forty years of material flammability: An appraisal of its role, its experimental determination and its modelling Material flammability is a fundamental aspect of fire as it corresponds to the root of a fire. Its characterisation through the identification of “fire properties” is essential. The concept of material flammability has evolved in the past forty years and its experimental and numerical development has followed the evolution of its role in the Fire Safety Engineering strategy. Two main approaches coexist: ranking-based and comprehensive. While the ranking-based approach is still mainly used in a prescriptive strategy, comprehensive approaches, more fundamental, expand with the growing use of the Performance-Based strategy. There are weaknesses associated with both approaches. The origin of these weaknesses can be understood by investigating the difficulties associated with the measurement and the modelling of material flammability. It ends up that despite the significant improvement in the past forty years, material flammability still represent a weak point in the global assessment of the fire safety level. Indeed, while the Heat Release Rate (HRR) is considered as the most important parameter in Fire Safety Engineering studies, it is also probably the “fire property” with the highest uncertainty. However, material flammability should not and cannot prevent innovation and building construction. This implies that the fire safety level should be thought of as a societal risk.
