You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and spontaneous emission techniques in monitoring thermal conversion of fuels Thermal conversion, such as combustion, is the basic utilization of fuel energy. In-situ detection of key parameters (e.g., components of fuel and combustion products, temperature, and pressure) is critical for improving the fuel utilization and the efficiency of thermal conversion equipment as well as to gain a full understanding of the mechanism of the thermal conversion process. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been verified to be applicable in the relevant industrial environment. In addition, combustion inherently comes with spontaneous emission, which contains important information about the process. This review discusses the application of atomic emission spectroscopy for monitoring the fuel thermal conversion process, including the characterization of raw energy materials (coal, biomass) before combustion, during the fuel combustion process (flame) and after combustion (fly ash). The first section is focused on LIBS for the analysis of raw energy materials in different forms like rock, pellets and particle flow. A series of online application instruments for energy materials properties analysis have been developed. The second section is focused on the characterization of the fuel combustion process with the use of LIBS and spontaneous emission. The third section is on unburned carbon detection in fly ash with LIBS. Furthermore, application prospects of LIBS and spontaneous emission techniques in the energy conversion field are analyzed and discussed to provide a reference for the development of technology.
