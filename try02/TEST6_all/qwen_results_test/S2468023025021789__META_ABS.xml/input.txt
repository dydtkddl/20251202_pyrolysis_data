Chitosan/ZIF-67 metal–organic framework /doum palm seed–derived activated carbon composite as a sustainable adsorbent for astrazon red FBL removal from water The discharge of synthetic dyes from textile industries poses a major environmental challenge due to their persistence, toxicity, and resistance to biodegradation. Astrazon Red FBL (C.I. Basic Red 46), a cationic dye seldom explored in adsorption research, represents a particularly concerning pollutant. This study is the first to integrate chitosan, ZIF-67 metal–organic framework, and biomass-derived activated carbon into a single hierarchical composite specifically designed for AR-FBL removal, combining sustainable precursors with MOF chemistry to achieve high adsorption efficiency for this under-studied dye. A novel Chitosan–ZIF-67–Doum Palm Seed–Activated Carbon composite (CS@ZIF-DPAC) was fabricated, valorizing desert biomass and integrating hierarchical porosity with abundant functional groups. Comprehensive characterization by SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, TGA, and XRF confirmed high crystallinity, thermal stability, and a large surface area (∼538.37 m2/g). Adsorption studies showed that performance was governed by initial dye concentration, contact time, pH, and temperature. At 180 min, an initial AR-FBL concentration of 100 mg·L-1, pH 7.0, and ambient temperature, the composite achieved an exceptional adsorption capacity of 322.9 ± 3.7 mg·g-1 with a removal efficiency of 97.8 ± 0.5 %. Kinetic modeling demonstrated excellent agreement with the pseudo-second-order model (R2 ≈ 0.999), confirming chemisorption as the dominant mechanism. Isotherm analysis identified Langmuir Type I as the best-fitting model (R2 ≈ 0.997), indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous and energetically uniform sites. Thermodynamic parameters indicated spontaneity (ΔG° = –19.4 to –34.6 kJ·mol-1), endothermicity (ΔH° = +92 ± 3.3 kJ·mol-1), and entropy-driven adsorption. Importantly, the composite retained 91.1 ± 1.2 % removal efficiency after five regeneration cycles, highlighting its robustness and reusability. These findings establish CS@ZIF-DPAC as a sustainable and highly efficient adsorbent for the remediation of persistent basic dyes from wastewater.
