You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chitosan/ZIF-67 metal–organic framework /doum palm seed–derived activated carbon composite as a sustainable adsorbent for astrazon red FBL removal from water The discharge of synthetic dyes from textile industries poses a major environmental challenge due to their persistence, toxicity, and resistance to biodegradation. Astrazon Red FBL (C.I. Basic Red 46), a cationic dye seldom explored in adsorption research, represents a particularly concerning pollutant. This study is the first to integrate chitosan, ZIF-67 metal–organic framework, and biomass-derived activated carbon into a single hierarchical composite specifically designed for AR-FBL removal, combining sustainable precursors with MOF chemistry to achieve high adsorption efficiency for this under-studied dye. A novel Chitosan–ZIF-67–Doum Palm Seed–Activated Carbon composite (CS@ZIF-DPAC) was fabricated, valorizing desert biomass and integrating hierarchical porosity with abundant functional groups. Comprehensive characterization by SEM, XRD, FTIR, BET, TGA, and XRF confirmed high crystallinity, thermal stability, and a large surface area (∼538.37 m2/g). Adsorption studies showed that performance was governed by initial dye concentration, contact time, pH, and temperature. At 180 min, an initial AR-FBL concentration of 100 mg·L-1, pH 7.0, and ambient temperature, the composite achieved an exceptional adsorption capacity of 322.9 ± 3.7 mg·g-1 with a removal efficiency of 97.8 ± 0.5 %. Kinetic modeling demonstrated excellent agreement with the pseudo-second-order model (R2 ≈ 0.999), confirming chemisorption as the dominant mechanism. Isotherm analysis identified Langmuir Type I as the best-fitting model (R2 ≈ 0.997), indicating monolayer adsorption on homogeneous and energetically uniform sites. Thermodynamic parameters indicated spontaneity (ΔG° = –19.4 to –34.6 kJ·mol-1), endothermicity (ΔH° = +92 ± 3.3 kJ·mol-1), and entropy-driven adsorption. Importantly, the composite retained 91.1 ± 1.2 % removal efficiency after five regeneration cycles, highlighting its robustness and reusability. These findings establish CS@ZIF-DPAC as a sustainable and highly efficient adsorbent for the remediation of persistent basic dyes from wastewater.
