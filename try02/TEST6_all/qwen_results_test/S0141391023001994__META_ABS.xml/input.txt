Recovery of chemical recyclates from fibre-reinforced composites: A review of progress In this critical review article, the current state-of-the-art in composite solvolysis is reviewed against the backdrop of a growing need for recycling in the composites industry. The scope of the review includes all fibre types in any polymer matrix but focuses on articles since 2015. Given the unique position of solvolysis for recovering products from matrix recyclates, it is noteworthy that relatively few studies have examined this aspect of solvolysis in detail, although particular attention is given herein to the works that do consider matrix recyclates. An additional emphasis is placed on critiquing the potential for scalability/industrialisation of the different technologies and the associated blockers. After the state-of-the-art review, a ‘cheat sheet’ of a typical solvolysis process is given, describing the workflow of the recycling treatment, the common metrics by which its success is measured, what substrates solvolysis is most suitable for, finally culminating in a technology readiness level (TRL) assessment of solvolysis in the UK and worldwide.
