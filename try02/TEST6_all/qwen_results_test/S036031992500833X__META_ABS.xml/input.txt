Study on the effect of NiFe2O4 on biomass gasification under water vapor-CO2 atmosphere In this paper, the effects of reaction temperature, water feed rate, catalyst cycle times, and water vapor-CO2-catalyst synergism on the gasification characteristics were investigated sequentially using Salix matsudana as raw material, and the reaction temperature of 700 °C, the water feed rate of 13.5 ml/h, the biomass-to-catalyst mixing mass ratio of 3, and the water vapor-CO2 gasification conditions were applied to peanut shells, mushroom bales, and Arundo donax. The experimental results showed that the catalyst was gasified stably in five cycles, and the hydrogen yield reached 22.93 mmol/g under the optimal gasification conditions, which was higher than the level at 760 °C without catalyst addition (18.56 mmol/g). From the CGE point of view, the highest CGE was found for the mushroom bales, which amounted to 96.98 %, while the lowest was found for the Arundo donax, which was only 57.998 %. This work provides a certain experimental basis for the industrial production of hydrogen rich biomass synthesis gas.
