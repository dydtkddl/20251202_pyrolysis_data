You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study on the technical and financial feasibility of producing lactic acid from sugarcane and beet molasses Lactic acid (LA) can be produced through fermentation by various microorganisms using various biological feedstocks. The present study conducted an estimation of the necessary resources, including equipment, raw materials, energy, and labour, as well as the associated costs, to produce LA through a yeast-based fermentation route. The techno-economic feasibility of establishing a pilot plant with a production capacity of 50 litters/ day (18 tons / year) within a plastic factory was assessed. The initial investment for setting up the pilot plant was approximately 400,000 EGP. The cost/kg of LA saw a decrease from 67.48 to 25.13 EGP over the trimesters, indicating potential economies of scale and operational efficiencies as production expanded. Revenue projections showed a gradual and consistent increase, starting at 288,283 EGP in Year 1 and steadily climbing to 1,688,721 EGP by Year 10, indicating a robust and promising revenue stream over the projected period. A cradle-to gate LCA was performed using Open LCA software, The impact evaluation for lactic acid manufacturing shows considerable environmental impacts across affect categories. The influence 2002+ approach measured water acidification at 13.828 kg SO₂ equivalent, indicating significant influence on aquatic ecosystem acidity. At 4.942 kg TEG soil, terrestrial ecotoxicity was substantially higher than aquatic ecotoxicity at 8.57 kg TEG soil, suggesting potential harm to terrestrial biodiversity. The CML-IA baseline approach showed nutrient enrichment with 7.473 kg PO₄ eq acidification potential and 5.3 kg SO₂ eq eutrophication impact.
