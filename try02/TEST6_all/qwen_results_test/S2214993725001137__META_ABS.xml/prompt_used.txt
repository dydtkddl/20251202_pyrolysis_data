You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in natural fibre based polymeric composites: A comprehensive review on mechanical-thermal performance and sustainability aspects Natural fibre composites (NFC) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional synthetic fibre composites, primarily attributed to their inherent environmental friendliness and sustainable nature. This review comprehensively evaluates the recent advancements in NFC concerning their thermal, mechanical, and sustainable attributes. The investigation encompasses a detailed analysis of influential factors, including fibre properties, chemical treatment, hybridization, particle addition, environmental conditions, and fabrication methods, with a specific focus on their impact on the mechanical and thermal behaviour of NFC. In the case of thermal performance, the review scrutinizes key aspects such as thermal conductivity, heat resistance, and flame retardancy of NFC. Emphasis is placed on understanding the significance of sustainability in NFC, encompassing discussions on environmental effects, sustainable material selection, and life cycle assessment. The critical assessment provided by this research offers insights into the intricate interplay of various factors shaping the thermal, mechanical, and sustainability characteristics of NFC. Overall, this review aims to furnish a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape in NFC, providing valuable insights into their thermal, mechanical, and sustainable attributes.
