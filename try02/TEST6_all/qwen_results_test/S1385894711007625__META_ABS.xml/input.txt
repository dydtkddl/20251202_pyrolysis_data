Catalytic dehydration of bioethanol to ethylene: Pilot-scale studies and process simulation Process of bioethanol dehydration to ethylene over alumina-based catalyst in tubular fixed bed reactor was studied both experimentally and numerically. Kinetic studies were carried out to determine the reaction network, to estimate the parameters of the kinetic model and to find the optimal conditions that provide the maximal ethylene yield in the reaction of bioethanol dehydration. Pilot scale studies and process simulation were carried out to determine the optimal technological regimes in a single catalyst tube as an element of a multi-tubular reactor. The optimal characteristics and process parameters of industrial tubular fixed bed reactor for ethylene production from bioethanol at capacity of 60,000 TPA have been determined.
