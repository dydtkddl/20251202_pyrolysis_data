Thermal properties of poly(vinyl chloride)/montmorillonite nanocomposites Poly(vinyl chloride)/montmorillonite (PVC/MMT) nanocomposites were synthesized via in situ intercalative polymerization and their thermal properties were examined by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The nanocomposites exhibited a little higher glass transition temperature in comparison with pure PVC. The presence of organophilic montmorillonite enhanced the rapidest decomposition temperature and reduced the maximum decomposition rate and the onset decomposition temperature. At high temperature, a compact char formed in the surface of the nanocomposites, obstructing the thermal degradation of the polymer matrix. The compact char surface was characterized by Fourier-transformed infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR).
