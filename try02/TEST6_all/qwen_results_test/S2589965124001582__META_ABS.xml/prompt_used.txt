You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Heterogeneous electrocatalytic synthesis of nitrogenous organic compounds using inorganic nitrogen sources Nitrogenous compounds (i.e., amines, amides, nitriles, oximes, amino acids and nitrogen-heterocycles derivatives) are important building blocks for synthetic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Conventional synthetic strategies involve the use of toxic organic nitrogenous precursors or expensive heterogeneous catalysts under elevated temperatures and pressurized oxygen. Heterogeneous electrocatalysis can initiate the activation of inorganic N sources (i.e., NH3 and NO x −) under ambient reactions in liquid phase by applying a small bias, thus allowing the synthesis of value−added nitrogenous compounds from carbonyls, alkenes, keto acids, and even carbon dioxide in a sustainable manner without the use of oxidants/reductants. This review outlines recent developments in electrosynthesis of nitrogenous compounds using inorganic N sources, focusing on reaction mechanisms understanding, the design and optimization of efficient electrocatalysts, and the advances in cell configurations for various C‒N coupling reactions. The limitations and challenges in applications are also discussed.
