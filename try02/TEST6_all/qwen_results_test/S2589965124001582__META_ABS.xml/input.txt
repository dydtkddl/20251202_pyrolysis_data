Heterogeneous electrocatalytic synthesis of nitrogenous organic compounds using inorganic nitrogen sources Nitrogenous compounds (i.e., amines, amides, nitriles, oximes, amino acids and nitrogen-heterocycles derivatives) are important building blocks for synthetic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. Conventional synthetic strategies involve the use of toxic organic nitrogenous precursors or expensive heterogeneous catalysts under elevated temperatures and pressurized oxygen. Heterogeneous electrocatalysis can initiate the activation of inorganic N sources (i.e., NH3 and NO x −) under ambient reactions in liquid phase by applying a small bias, thus allowing the synthesis of value−added nitrogenous compounds from carbonyls, alkenes, keto acids, and even carbon dioxide in a sustainable manner without the use of oxidants/reductants. This review outlines recent developments in electrosynthesis of nitrogenous compounds using inorganic N sources, focusing on reaction mechanisms understanding, the design and optimization of efficient electrocatalysts, and the advances in cell configurations for various C‒N coupling reactions. The limitations and challenges in applications are also discussed.
