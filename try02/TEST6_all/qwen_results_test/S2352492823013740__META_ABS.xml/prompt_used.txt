You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the pyrolysis mechanisms of three archetypal ablative resins through pyrolysis experiments and ReaxFF MD simulations Boron (B-PF), high carbon (HC-PF), and silicone phenolic resins (Si-PF) are typical structures of high-temperature resistant resins with exceptional ablation resistance. Nevertheless, the mechanism of their pyrolytic behavior under ultra-high temperatures remains unclear. Herein, the pyrolysis processes and mechanisms of the three resins are investigated in-depth through experiments and ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations. According to the experimental results, the final residual carbon rate of the resin shows B-PF > HC-PF > Si-PF. The main products of resin pyrolysis are H2, CH4, CO, small molecular hydrocarbons, and phenolic compounds. The simulation results show that the different types of phenolic resins have consistent pyrolysis products. The main small molecule products are H2, H2O, CO and C2H2. Moreover, these reaction paths are monitored and analyzed. The hydroxyl groups on the naphthalene ring in the high-carbon phenolic make the ring more active and susceptible to decarbonization processes, releasing more carbon monoxide (CO). When silicone resins undergo pyrolysis at high temperatures, the resulting H2O reacts with fragments of silicon-containing molecules to form new silicon oxides upon cooling. The B-O bond in boron phenolic undergoes reorganization upon breakage to form a B-containing five-membered ring, a factor that affects its thermal stability. This research reveals the pyrolytic properties of various phenolic resins and provides a theoretical basis for further research into the pyrolytic behavior of different resins.
