You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of the conditions for reforming HDPE pyrolysis volatiles on the catalyst deactivation by coke Pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor (500°C) and the volatiles have been reformed in-line over a Ni commercial catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor. The evolution of reaction indices (conversion, H2 yield and other gaseous product yields) with time on stream has been studied under the following operating conditions: temperature, 600–700°C; space-time, 8.3–20.8gcat mingHDPE −1, and steam/plastic ratio, 3–5. High initial conversion (>94.5%) and H2 yields (>76.7%) are attained under all the operating conditions studied, with HDPE conversion and H2 yield increasing when the three variables are increased, which is explained by the enhancement of the reforming reaction. However, a significant effect of operating conditions on catalyst stability has been observed. Thus, an increase in temperature, space-time and steam/plastic ratio decreases catalyst deactivation as a consequence of a lower rate of coke deposition on the catalyst due to both a lower C5+ coke precursor amount in the reaction medium and a higher gasification rate of the coke deposited.
