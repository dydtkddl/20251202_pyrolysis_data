You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of upgraded fuel blend from fast pyrolysis bio-oil and organic solvent using a novel three-stage catalytic process and its combustion characteristics in a diesel engine An interdisciplinary approach involving the production and engine testing of a fuel blend containing upgraded bio-oil and fossil-derived solvent has been investigated in this present study. First, a novel 3-stage process of solvent-assisted catalytic upgrading of fast pyrolysis bio-oil was used to obtain a fuel blend with nearly 18 vol% biofuel content. Upgrading reactions were carried out between 160 °C and 300 °C, with 10 bar hydrogen gas, using 5 wt% Pt/Al203 catalyst for each of the three stages, with the main conversion reactions occurring in the first stage. The upgrading process produced 21.8 wt% of hydrocarbon-rich biofuel on bio-oil basis, achieving a high degree of deoxygenation with only 0.19 wt% oxygen in the final product. This was followed by the study of its combustion and emission characteristics in a 3-cylinder diesel engine, using a 10 vol% biofuel content in kerosene. All relevant testing regimes for liquid fuels were carried out, with its combustion and emission characteristics showing superior or similar results to those of conventions kerosene and diesel. The tested biofuel blend showed 2 % increments in engine performance. Overall, this work represents a significant advancement in the production of green liquid hydrocarbon-rich fuels for transport and domestic uses.
