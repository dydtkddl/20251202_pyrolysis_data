You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable biopolymer-based materials for oil spill remediation: artificial intelligence integration and technoeconomic insights - A review Climate change and environmental degradation have heightened the urgency for sustainable strategies to address oil contamination in aquatic ecosystems. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of recent progress in biopolymer-based materials as environmentally friendly alternatives for oil spill remediation. Different types of biopolymers such as polysaccharides, proteins, and microbial biopolymers are discussed in detail to highlight their unique functions and application potentials. Moreover, the article elaborates on different key mechanisms including adsorption, emulsion breaking, flocculation, membrane separation, and biodegradation, with a particular focus on how the structural properties of biopolymers and various environmental conditions affect their performance. Innovative modification techniques such as chemical functionalization, nanoparticles incorporation, cross-linking, and electrospinning are examined for their potential to enhance biopolymers effectiveness. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis offers a detailed overview of global research trends, collaboration networks, and publication patterns within this interdisciplinary field. A significant emphasis is placed on the integration of artificial intelligence approaches, including predictive modeling, intelligent monitoring systems, and machine learning algorithms, to optimize the design and application of biopolymers for improved oil remediation outcomes. The review also addresses sustainability considerations through technoeconomic analysis, life cycle assessment, and circular economy principles, highlighting biopolymers' role in waste valorization and environmental management. This comprehensive examination serves as a foundation to support future interdisciplinary efforts in developing effective, sustainable, and innovative solutions for oil contamination remediation.
