Sustainable biopolymer-based materials for oil spill remediation: artificial intelligence integration and technoeconomic insights - A review Climate change and environmental degradation have heightened the urgency for sustainable strategies to address oil contamination in aquatic ecosystems. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of recent progress in biopolymer-based materials as environmentally friendly alternatives for oil spill remediation. Different types of biopolymers such as polysaccharides, proteins, and microbial biopolymers are discussed in detail to highlight their unique functions and application potentials. Moreover, the article elaborates on different key mechanisms including adsorption, emulsion breaking, flocculation, membrane separation, and biodegradation, with a particular focus on how the structural properties of biopolymers and various environmental conditions affect their performance. Innovative modification techniques such as chemical functionalization, nanoparticles incorporation, cross-linking, and electrospinning are examined for their potential to enhance biopolymers effectiveness. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis offers a detailed overview of global research trends, collaboration networks, and publication patterns within this interdisciplinary field. A significant emphasis is placed on the integration of artificial intelligence approaches, including predictive modeling, intelligent monitoring systems, and machine learning algorithms, to optimize the design and application of biopolymers for improved oil remediation outcomes. The review also addresses sustainability considerations through technoeconomic analysis, life cycle assessment, and circular economy principles, highlighting biopolymers' role in waste valorization and environmental management. This comprehensive examination serves as a foundation to support future interdisciplinary efforts in developing effective, sustainable, and innovative solutions for oil contamination remediation.
