You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic study on levoglucosan condensation and decomposition in the condensed phase during cellulose pyrolysis In this study, the condensation, as the fundamental step of polymerization, and decomposition mechanisms of levoglucosan in the condensed phase during cellulose pyrolysis were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate non-specific solvent effects. The condensed phase was simulated using an implicit solvent model, while the dielectric constants of levoglucosan at different temperatures were determined by theoretical calculations. This study considered levoglucosan condensation reactions to form anhydro-disaccharides with various α and β linkages (including 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-glycosidic bonds) and levoglucosan decomposition reactions including 1,2-dehydration, 1,3-dehydration, and ring-opening reactions. Our results show that the formation of β-anhydro-disaccharides prefers the direct condensation mechanism of two levoglucosan molecules through a four-member ring transition state, while kinetically more disadvantageous α-anhydro-disaccharides are generally formed by the condensation of levoglucosan molecule and α-d-glucose from levoglucosan hydrolysis. However, levoglucosan condensation without catalysis is unlikely to take place at typical temperatures of cellulose pyrolysis, due to the low reaction rate at low temperatures. At high temperatures above 625 K, levoglucosan condensation is also inhibited due to the higher ΔGθ and lower reaction rates, compared to those of levoglucosan decomposition. A high temperature above 800 K is needed for the obvious decomposition of levoglucosan, mainly through the ring-opening reaction to form 5-keto-6-deoxy-glucose, which is further promoted by the dielectric environment of the condensed phase during cellulose pyrolysis. Further calculations on acetic acid-catalyzed levoglucosan condensation and decomposition suggest that the consumption of levoglucosan at low temperatures is mainly due to catalysis of acetic acid on polymerization and further decomposition of polymers.
