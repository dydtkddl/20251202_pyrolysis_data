You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanism study on the pyrolysis of the typical ether linkages in biomass The in-depth study of the cleavage behaviors of linkages in biomass is important for the better understanding of biomass pyrolysis mechanism. This study aimed to clarify the pyrolysis mechanism of the typical ether linkages in biomass including β-1,4-glycosidic bond, α-O-4 bond and methoxyl using cellobiose, benzylphenyl ether and guaiacol as the model compounds. Combining the detection of the key intermediates, especially radicals by SVUV-PIMS and the evaluation of the reaction pathways by density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations, it was found that the concerted cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bond was more kinetically favorable than homolytic cleavage and heterolytic cleavage, and the ring opening of cellobiose via the breakage of C1′-O was likely to occur before the cleavage of glycosidic bond. The α-O-4 bond in benzylphenyl ether was mainly cleaved by Cα-O homolysis, and it was easy for the formed radicals to recombine with each other to yield phenolic dimers. In the initial evolution process of methoxyl in guaiacol, homolytic demethylation was the most important unimolecular reaction, while demethoxylation and radical-induced rearrangement reactions were difficult to occur due to their high energy barriers. In the presence of the formed methyl radicals from homolytic demethylation reaction, these two reactions would occur since their energy barriers were significantly reduced at this condition.
