Mechanism study on the pyrolysis of the typical ether linkages in biomass The in-depth study of the cleavage behaviors of linkages in biomass is important for the better understanding of biomass pyrolysis mechanism. This study aimed to clarify the pyrolysis mechanism of the typical ether linkages in biomass including β-1,4-glycosidic bond, α-O-4 bond and methoxyl using cellobiose, benzylphenyl ether and guaiacol as the model compounds. Combining the detection of the key intermediates, especially radicals by SVUV-PIMS and the evaluation of the reaction pathways by density functional theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations, it was found that the concerted cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bond was more kinetically favorable than homolytic cleavage and heterolytic cleavage, and the ring opening of cellobiose via the breakage of C1′-O was likely to occur before the cleavage of glycosidic bond. The α-O-4 bond in benzylphenyl ether was mainly cleaved by Cα-O homolysis, and it was easy for the formed radicals to recombine with each other to yield phenolic dimers. In the initial evolution process of methoxyl in guaiacol, homolytic demethylation was the most important unimolecular reaction, while demethoxylation and radical-induced rearrangement reactions were difficult to occur due to their high energy barriers. In the presence of the formed methyl radicals from homolytic demethylation reaction, these two reactions would occur since their energy barriers were significantly reduced at this condition.
