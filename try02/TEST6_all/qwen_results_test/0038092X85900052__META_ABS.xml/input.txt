A solar reactor for high-temperature gas phase reactions (water and carbon dioxide thermolysis and nitric oxide synthesis) This paper deals with an original way for carrying out highly endothermic reactions at high temperature under concentrated radiant energy. Three examples of chemical reactions were chosen: thermal direct decompositions of water and of carbon dioxide, and synthesis of nitric oxide from air. In the first part, we present a preliminary theoretical study concerning the thermodynamics and the kinetics of the selected reactions. Then, we describe an experimental system consisting of a “dissociation reactor” located at the focus of either an image furnace or a solar concentrator, and a quenching device in which the hot gases are quickly cooled by mixing with turbulent gas jets. Such a system can store solar energy in the form of chemical compounds such as H2, CO with an energetical yield ranging about 1%. A simple mathematical model points out the importance of quenching phenomena with respect to the considered reactions.
