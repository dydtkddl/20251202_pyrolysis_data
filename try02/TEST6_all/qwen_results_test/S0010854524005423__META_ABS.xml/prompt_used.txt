You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances on visible and near-infrared thermometric phosphors with ambient temperature sensitivity: A review The quantification of the exact temperature with precision is fundamentally vital for scientific exploration and industrial production. As a result, the accuracy of regular thermometers is currently questionable for measuring the temperature at sub-micrometric spatial resolution. Hence, there is a high demand for advanced non-contact thermometer sensors, which aid in the alternative fabrication of luminescence thermometry to monitor the temperature with precision accuracy. Therefore, the current review article focuses on the recent advances in luminescence thermometry, also known as optical thermometry, and its applications in biomedical imaging and intracellular temperature sensing. The review will also provide a detailed discussion concerning spectroscopic approaches for temperature read-out, and different materials utilized in this field, including organic compounds, quantum dots, metal nanoclusters-based, upconverting nanoparticles, dye-doped nanoparticles, and luminescence thermometry based on rare-earths. Furthermore, covered is the synthesis of rare earth elements and post-transition metals-based near-infrared thermometric phosphors. Nonetheless, more research is required to completely comprehend the properties and realize the potential applications of these materials. To create high-performing thermometers with desired properties and thermometric parameters, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the material parameters that affect the thermometric performance of the phosphor. This includes understanding the role of these parameters that relate to sensitivity. Furthermore, the temperature sensitivity also depends on the synthesis and size of the material for thermometry applications. As a result, more efforts are needed to improve the current synthesis methods that offer the nanoparticles because they have poor luminescence and a very low photoluminescence quantum yield. Lastly, we discuss notable factors influencing the sensitivity of optical thermometers and their future directions.
