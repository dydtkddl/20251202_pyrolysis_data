You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on versatile nano-photocatalysts for environmental remediation: Carbon-decorated bismuth-based nanomaterials Bismuth–carbon-based materials have recently gained much attention because of their excellent physicochemical properties, possessing favourable characteristics for many crucial applications. Recent literature has documented several achievements, especially on the degradation of drugs and dyes. Regarding the potential applications of bismuth carbon-based photocatalytic materials for wastewater treatment-based environmental remediation, no study has been performed. The outstanding characteristics of carbon materials, including their distinctive nanocrystal formations, high electrical conductivity, inherent hydrophobicity and customizable surface properties, make them ideal for various catalytic techniques, including photocatalysis. Bismuth–carbon-based compounds are available in nature and are ecologically beneficial, making them an excellent alternative to conventional photocatalysts. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of the current developments of the various bismuthal materials and the synthesis of bismuth carbon-based photocatalysts, with a particular focus on the possibilities for the photodegradation of a variety of organic contaminants. Initially, numerous synthetic methods, various bismuthal materials and the properties of carbon materials are methodically discussed. Recent developments are highlighted in the manufacturing of bismuth–carbon-based materials for photocatalytic performance applications.
