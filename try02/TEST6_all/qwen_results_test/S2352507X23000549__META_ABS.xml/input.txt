A review on versatile nano-photocatalysts for environmental remediation: Carbon-decorated bismuth-based nanomaterials Bismuth–carbon-based materials have recently gained much attention because of their excellent physicochemical properties, possessing favourable characteristics for many crucial applications. Recent literature has documented several achievements, especially on the degradation of drugs and dyes. Regarding the potential applications of bismuth carbon-based photocatalytic materials for wastewater treatment-based environmental remediation, no study has been performed. The outstanding characteristics of carbon materials, including their distinctive nanocrystal formations, high electrical conductivity, inherent hydrophobicity and customizable surface properties, make them ideal for various catalytic techniques, including photocatalysis. Bismuth–carbon-based compounds are available in nature and are ecologically beneficial, making them an excellent alternative to conventional photocatalysts. The goal of this review is to present a thorough analysis of the current developments of the various bismuthal materials and the synthesis of bismuth carbon-based photocatalysts, with a particular focus on the possibilities for the photodegradation of a variety of organic contaminants. Initially, numerous synthetic methods, various bismuthal materials and the properties of carbon materials are methodically discussed. Recent developments are highlighted in the manufacturing of bismuth–carbon-based materials for photocatalytic performance applications.
