You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced engineering of nanostructured carbons for lithium–sulfur batteries The present-day lithium ion batteries represent a brilliant electrochemical energy storage technology that has established a dominant niche in portable electronics, yet loses the potentiality in applications that demand increasing energy density such as electric vehicles. Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are considered as an alternative candidate owing to its ultrahigh energy density, low cost, natural abundance, and eco-friendliness. However, the paramount challenges to become a viable technology include inferior utilization of active materials, short cycle life, and low Coulombic efficiency, which are closely associated with the structural designs of sulfur cathodes. Significant progresses and breakthroughs have been made in the most recent years towards the successful modification of the sulfur cathodes for high-performance Li–S batteries. Among them, nanostructured carbons have been demonstrated to be particularly effective to address the critical hurdles mentioned above. To promote the advancement of this exciting field, this article herein will discuss the progresses of the sulfur cathodes with an emphasis on the advanced engineering of nanostructured carbons to improve specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency, high-rate capability, and cycling retention. The review article primarily covers “inside” and “outside” design strategies on cathodes by developing carbon–sulfur composites and novel cell configurations, respectively. Discussion will be detailed to correlate synthesis principles and characteristics of nanostructured carbons with electrochemical performance.
