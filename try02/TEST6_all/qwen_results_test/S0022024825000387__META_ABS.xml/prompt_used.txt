You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Columnar dendritic growth during directional solidification of neopentylglycol-(d)camphor investigated under microgravity conditions We investigated dendritic solidification in the binary transparent organic model alloy neopentylglycol-(d)camphor under microgravity conditions onboard the International Space Station. Three cartridges containing alloys with hypoeutectic compositions of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.375 wt-frac. (d)Camphor were processed repeatedly in the “Transparent Alloys” solidification facility. In these Bridgman-type experiments, the dendritic grain structure − columnar, equiaxed or both mixed − was determined by in-situ optical observation as a function of alloy composition, crystallographic growth orientation, applied temperature field and cartridge withdrawal velocity. In most experiments, a columnar-equiaxed transition was achieved by increasing the cartridge velocity. We describe the experimental setup and procedure and focus on analysis of the columnar dendritic growth regime here. This includes estimates of the temperature gradient and supercooling at the columnar and eutectic front in combination with thermal modelling, as well as evaluation of a characteristic dendrite spacing. The results complement ground-based and other short-duration microgravity experiments in the same compositional range of the alloy. For eutectic growth, the undercooling increases linearly with cooling-rate. For columnar dendritic growth, the comparison of the kinetic law with previous experimental results exhibits similar trends but also significant deviations, which may be attributed to the different experimental set-up, data analysis and accuracy of temperature prediction. The determined characteristic dendrite spacing is well predicted by the models of Trivedi, Lu/Hunt and Ma/Sahm.
