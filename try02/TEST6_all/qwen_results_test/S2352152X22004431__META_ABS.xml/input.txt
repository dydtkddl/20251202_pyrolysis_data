Influence of metal-organic framework MOF-76(Gd) activation/carbonization on the cycle performance stability in Li-S battery Carbon materials are widely used as sulphur support to improve the cycle performance, efficiency, electrode stability and high discharge capacity of lithium-sulphur batteries. Metal-organic frameworks with their unique structure can confine polysulphides and restrain the shuttle effect. Microporous metal-organic framework MOF-76(Gd) was synthesized and applied as a support for sulphur in lithium-sulphur batteries. To achieve better conductivity, MOF-76(Gd) was carbonized and applied as a conductive nest in the sulphur cathode. Activated (AC) and carbonized (C) MOF-76(Gd) in electrode material displayed sulphur encapsulation and polysulphide confinement which was proved by stable capacity during cycling. The carbonized MOF-76(Gd) in cathode material showed an initial discharge capacity of 658 mAh g−1, and after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity retention was almost 93%.
