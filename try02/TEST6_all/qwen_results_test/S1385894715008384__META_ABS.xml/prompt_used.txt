You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene on a MoVTeNbO/TiO2 catalyst in an industrial-scale packed bed catalytic reactor The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH-Et) seems the most promising alternative to produce ethylene compared to conventional processes. Nevertheless, there is not even a pilot plant for ODH-Et worldwide nowadays. This work presents the simulation of the catalytic behavior of a highly active and selective MoVTeNbO catalyst for the ODH-Et in a wall-cooled industrial-scale packed-bed reactor with a tube to particle diameter ratio equal to 3.12. The feasibility of using this complex yet necessary reactor design, as well as the influence of operating conditions on conversion and yield along the reactor are analyzed. The simulations are carried out using a two-dimensional pseudo-heterogeneous model, which makes use of both a reliable kinetic model and reliable transport parameters. Specifically, the kinetic model, obtained from lab-scale experimental data, is coupled to the reactor model accounting for transport phenomena wherein the effect of hydrodynamics on heat transfer is assessed from independent experiments in absence of reaction in an industrial-scale reactor. The developed kinetics successfully accounts for both the inhibiting effect of adsorbed water on oxidative dehydrogenation and total oxidations and the effect of the inlet partial pressure of oxygen and ethane on conversion and selectivity. Besides, the reactor model elucidates the importance of accounting for the role of the hydrodynamics on the heat transport in order to have reliable conversion and yield predictions. From the parametric sensitivity study, the temperature of the coolant fluid and the inlet ethane concentration are variables for tuning the reactor performance.
