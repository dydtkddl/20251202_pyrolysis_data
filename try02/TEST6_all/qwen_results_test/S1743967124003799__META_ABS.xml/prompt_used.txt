You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cerium-induced modification of acid-base sites in Ni-zeolite catalysts for improved dry reforming of methane Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a promising route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by converting CH4 and CO2 into valuable syngas. The present work explores the effect of Ce addition to Ni-based catalysts supported on CBV3020E (ZSM-5) for DRM. The use of Ce as a promoter to tune the acid-base properties of zeolites for DRM is addressed for the first time in detail. While Ce has traditionally been used to improve oxygen storage capacity, this work explores its novel use as a means to enhance surface basicity and promote CO2 adsorption. The samples were prepared by wet impregnation, characterized using N2-sorption, X-ray diffraction, H2-temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 and ammonia, and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, and tested for DRM at 800 °C and 42,000 mL/g.h GHSV. Results show that ZSM-5 zeolite can be beneficial in achieving high metal dispersion. The introduction of 2 wt% Ce to Ni5/ZSM-5 increases the concentration of strong basic sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance from 37 % CH4 conversion and 48 % CO2 conversion for Ni5/ZSM-5 to 55 % and 65 % on promoted Ni5Ce2/ZSM-5, respectively. Thus, the best results are observed on Ni5Ce2/ZSM-5 and an optimal H2/CO ratio of 0.84 is achieved in this case. Upon decreasing GHSV to 15,000 mL/g.h, CH4 and CO2 conversions jump to 83 % and 88 %, respectively on Ni5Ce2/ZSM-5. Cerium doping produces more desirable strong basic sites and enhances NiO reducibility. This promotes CO2 adsorption and drives the catalytic reaction towards syngas formation, which eventually results in increased efficiency and improved performance.
