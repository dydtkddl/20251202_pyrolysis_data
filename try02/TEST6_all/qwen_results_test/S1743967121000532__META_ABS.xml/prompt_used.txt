You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics as a route to upgraded bio-oil A two-stage reactor system consisting of co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic in the 1st stage and catalytic upgrading (zeolite ZSM-5 catalyst) of the derived pyrolysis gases in the 2nd stage was used to investigate the yield and composition of the product gases and bio-oil. Biomass waste wood and waste plastics in the form of high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate were used as feedstock. The addition of the plastics to the biomass with co-pyrolysis-catalysis, produced a higher CnHm gas yield compared with what would be expected by calculation, suggesting some interaction of the biomass and plastic. The presence of waste plastic resulted in a decrease in the relative proportion of oxygenated compounds in the product oil compared to pyrolysis of biomass alone; for example a reduction of >65% for biomass with polyethylene and polypropylene and >95% reduction for biomass with polystyrene. The fuel properties of the co-pyrolysis upgraded oil were improved compared to biomass alone; for example, the co-pyrolysis of polystyrene and biomass showed an improved relative proportion of compounds in the C5 ― C12 fuel range (76%). In terms of the ratio of biomass to plastic, even low quantities of plastic (9:1 biomass:plastic ratio) produced a lower relative proportion of oxygenated bio-oil compounds, for example biomass:polystyrene at a ratio of 9:1 reduced the relative proportion of oxygenated compounds in the product bio-oil by >55%.
