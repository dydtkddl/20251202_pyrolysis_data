You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence and applications of refractive index on the catalytic perfomance of photo-responsive materials The fundamental optical property that influences the interaction between light and matter is the refractive index (η). This parameter has garnered a whole lot of attention in the optimization of photocatalytic systems. This study carefully examines how ŋcalculated from absorbance data, affects and enhances the photocatalytic performance of semiconductor materials. Thus, influences how light interacts with the material’s surface and interfaces, potentially affecting charge carrier dynamics and reaction kinetics. The study on commonly used photocatalysts like TiO₂, WO₃, NiO, and ZnO shows that adjusting the n, through the adoption of various techniques, which nanostructuring, and composite formation, can significantly affect light absorption, charge carrier separation, and surface redox reactions of photoactive material. It was observed that higher refractive indices often correlate with enhanced light trapping and absorption, thereby improving photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the study shows that experimental and literature-derived data affirm that the optimization of n directly correlates with improved photocatalytic performance in the application of semiconductors for the degradation of organic pollutants and CO₂ reduction. Furthermore, this study provides a multidimensional framework for tailoring η as a critical parameter in photocatalyst design in material engineering to achieve an optimum property, mainly for environmental remediation and energy conversion purposes.
