You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Natural zeolite catalyzed cracking-assisted light hydrocarbon extraction of bitumen from Athabasca oilsands The bitumen in the Canadian oilsands reserves, one of the largest petroleum resources in the world, has higher viscosity and higher concentrations of contaminant heteroatoms and heavy metals than those found in typical crude oil. Current extraction processes, predominantly hot water extraction methods, are extremely water-intensive and generate high volumes of waste that is challenging to treat prior to reuse or release. Natural minerals such as chabazite and clinoptilolite, when acidified, have the ability to catalyze the cracking of bitumen, lowering the viscosity while adsorbing a large fraction of the undesirable compounds. In this study, light hydrocarbons (pentane and hexane) are employed instead of water to extract natural zeolite-cracked bitumen fractions from the oilsand matrix. Boiling point analysis of the light hydrocarbon-extracted bitumen fractions demonstrates that catalytic cracking by clinoptilolite reduces the vacuum residual fraction generated from pentane- and hexane-extracted bitumen by 50% (from 25% to as low as 12%). The products are almost entirely extractable using light hydrocarbons, indicating that the asphaltene fraction has been cracked. Based on these results, one can envision a waterless self-extraction process in which natural zeolites break down bitumen into lighter, less viscous components, remove contaminants, and produce light hydrocarbons in situ.
