You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Glass-bonded ceramic waste forms for immobilization of radioiodine from caustic scrubber wastes Glass-bonded sodalite composite waste forms have been developed for the immobilization of liquid radioactive wastes resulting from off-gas treatment during aqueous reprocessing of used nuclear fuel, with a particular focus on 129I. The proposed composite waste form is comprised of aluminosilicate ceramic phases containing volatile radionuclides bonded with a glassy matrix. In this work, a suite of ten candidate low-temperature glass binders (ZnO-Bi2O3-based glasses and a Na2O-B2O3-SiO2 glass) were examined. Six glasses were mixed with caustic scrubber waste simulant previously converted into a sodalite-rich material (to provide glass fractions of 10 and 20 wt.%), uniaxially pressed into pellets, and sintered at 350 °C or 550 °C for 8 h in air. Iodine retention after heat treatment was assessed by neutron activation analysis, showing retention of 67–100 % of expected iodine. The aqueous durabilities of the resulting materials were then determined, following the ASTM C1308 standard test, showing iodine releases of 1 to 23 g m−2 after 4 d. The cumulative iodine release for the best performing system (a zinc-bismuth-borate glass binder) was <1 g m−2, and its iodine retention from processing was 67 %. The iodine releases compared favorably with other waste forms. In parallel, this best-performing composition was also consolidated via hot isostatic pressing (HIP) in a stainless-steel canister at 550 °C for 2 h under 100 MPa pressure. The HIPed sample was produced at the ∼20 g scale and showed improved densification and minimal reaction with the canister.
