Glass-bonded ceramic waste forms for immobilization of radioiodine from caustic scrubber wastes Glass-bonded sodalite composite waste forms have been developed for the immobilization of liquid radioactive wastes resulting from off-gas treatment during aqueous reprocessing of used nuclear fuel, with a particular focus on 129I. The proposed composite waste form is comprised of aluminosilicate ceramic phases containing volatile radionuclides bonded with a glassy matrix. In this work, a suite of ten candidate low-temperature glass binders (ZnO-Bi2O3-based glasses and a Na2O-B2O3-SiO2 glass) were examined. Six glasses were mixed with caustic scrubber waste simulant previously converted into a sodalite-rich material (to provide glass fractions of 10 and 20 wt.%), uniaxially pressed into pellets, and sintered at 350 °C or 550 °C for 8 h in air. Iodine retention after heat treatment was assessed by neutron activation analysis, showing retention of 67–100 % of expected iodine. The aqueous durabilities of the resulting materials were then determined, following the ASTM C1308 standard test, showing iodine releases of 1 to 23 g m−2 after 4 d. The cumulative iodine release for the best performing system (a zinc-bismuth-borate glass binder) was <1 g m−2, and its iodine retention from processing was 67 %. The iodine releases compared favorably with other waste forms. In parallel, this best-performing composition was also consolidated via hot isostatic pressing (HIP) in a stainless-steel canister at 550 °C for 2 h under 100 MPa pressure. The HIPed sample was produced at the ∼20 g scale and showed improved densification and minimal reaction with the canister.
