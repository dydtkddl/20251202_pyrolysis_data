Co-pyrolysis of Baiyinhua lignite and pine in an infrared-heated fixed bed to improve tar yield Co-pyrolysis of Baiyinhua lignite and pine was studied to reveal the synergistic effects in an infrared-heated fixed bed reactor. The effect of feeding mode, heating rate (0.5–20 °C/s), pyrolysis temperature (450–600 °C) and blending ratio on products distribution and tar compositions were investigated. The results show that the synergetic effects between lignite and pine vary with feeding modes, and the yield and compositions of the resultant tar suffer remarkable feed influence. The tar yield from feeding mode U (coal layer in upper layer) is 8.25 wt.% higher than others. Moreover, a columnar feeding mode was specifically designed and the pine was substituted by compressed pine to reveal the importance of void space among feeding particles for volatiles reaction. When the blending ratio is 1:1, the tar yield and the difference between experimental and calculated tar yield reach the maximum. The study on the effect of temperature and heating rate on co-pyrolysis show best co-pyrolysis behavior occurs at 550 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/s.
