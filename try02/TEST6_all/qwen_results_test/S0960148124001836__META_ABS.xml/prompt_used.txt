You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification characteristics of Ca-rich sludge and Fe-rich sludge under CO2 atmosphere, and potential utilization of gasification residues as renewable catalyst in biomass pyrolysis The co-gasification behaviors and performances of Ca-rich sludge (CS) and Fe-rich sludge (FS) were studied by thermogravimetric analyzer. The results showed that the comprehensive gasification index was highest at 40% CS ratio, which was 9.7 × 10−8 %2/(min2·°C3). The co-gasification resulted in more solid products generation due to that ash hindered contacts of gasifying agent and organics. By the sliding resistance furnace (SRF), in 80%CO2/20%N2, the evolution of gas compositions during the gasification process and impacts of different temperatures and blending ratios on co-gasification were evaluated. The evolution of gas compositions showed that the gas yields from CS gasification were higher than those from FS, and the interactions and ash catalytic effect during the co-gasification made the peak times earlier. The reaction temperatures and blending ratios had certain effects on the co-gasification process, affecting the mineral compositions and pores structures of sludge residues. Finally, considering the attributes of rich pores structure and Ca/Fe elements, the gasification residues can be used as ex-situ catalyst in the modification of biomass pyrolytic volatiles. Conducting the pyrolysis experiments by the SRF under N2 atmosphere, with adding gasification residues of sludge, the CO yield from biomass pyrolysis grew, but the yields of CO2, H2 and C2Hm reduced.
