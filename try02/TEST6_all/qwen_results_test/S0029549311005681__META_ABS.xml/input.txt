A fuel performance analysis for a 450MWth deep burn-high temperature reactor A performance analysis for a 450MWth deep burn-high temperature reactor (DB-HTR) fuel was performed using COPA, a fuel performance analysis code of Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). The code computes gas pressure buildup in the void volume of a tri-isotropic coated fuel particle (TRISO), temperature distribution in a DB-HTR fuel, thermo-mechanical stress in a coated fuel particle (CFP), failure fractions of a batch of CFPs, and fission product (FP) releases into the coolant. The 350μm DB-HTR kernel is composed of 30% UO2 +70% (5% NpO2 +95% PuO1.8) mixed with 0.6moles of silicon carbide (SiC) per mole of heavy metal. The DB-HTR is operated at the constant temperature and power of 858°C and 39.02mW per CFP for 1395 effective full power days (EFPD) and is subjected to a core heat-up event for 250h during which the maximum coolant temperature reaches 1548.70°C. Within the normal operating temperature, the fuel showed good thermal and mechanical integrity. At elevated temperatures of the accident event, the failure fraction of CFPs resulted from the mechanical failure (MF) and the thermal decomposition (TD) of the SiC barrier is 3.30×10−3.
