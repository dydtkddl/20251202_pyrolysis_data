You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A general model for air gasification of heterogenous municipal solid waste Sustainable management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is crucial due to its huge volume and cash flow. Among the different waste-to-energy solutions, gasification is considered an interesting option compared to incineration, which is the most common technology to valorise MSW, because of higher efficiency, lower environmental impacts, and producing hydrogen or other biofuel and biochemical products. However, mechanical–biological treatment of MSW results in heterogenous materials mainly composed of plastics, paper, and textiles, which troubles a reliable study of gasification. Hence, a flexible model of a fluidized bed air gasifier is developed in Aspen Plus in this work based on the experimental data from the literature to estimate the syngas properties from residual MSW of composting facilities. The developed model gives a low heating value (LHV) of the syngas in the range 4.2–7.3 MJ/Nm3 considering the characteristics of the residual MSW from a real composting facility, which is in line with the experimental values reported in the literature. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed varying the composition of the residual waste from the mechanical–biological treatment to support preliminary feasibility analyses of energy production from heterogeneous materials. The results showed a good capability of the model in predicting the energy performance of the fluidized bed gasifiers varying feedstock materials and equivalence ratios.
