You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced removal of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ ions on porous carbon from aqueous solutions by capacitive deionization: Performance study and underlying mechanism In this paper, nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials were successfully prepared using sucrose and activated carbon as raw materials and NH4Cl as nitrogen dopant by foaming and pyrolysis. The nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC-1) sample has a large specific surface area (798.425 m2/g) and good electrochemical properties. Capacitive deionization (CDI) tests showed that the removal rate was over 87% and 85% in the mixture of three ions (Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+), when the initial concentration of ternary mixed solution was 10 mg/L and 20 mg/L and the voltage was 1.2 V. Density-functional-transfer theory (DFT) calculations revealed that materials containing pyridine-N and pyrrolic-N have better adsorption properties for Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ than materials containing graphite-N and materials without doped nitrogen. Meanwhile, the adsorption energy of pyridine-N and pyrrolic-N models for Pb atom are larger than those of pyridine-N and pyrrolic-N models for Cd and Zn atoms. This indicated that the NPC-1 electrode has better electrosorption capacity for Pb2+, which was consistent with the experimental results. After twenty cycles experiments, the NPC-1 electrode maintained a high removal rate for Pb2+ (95%), Cd2+ (82%), and Zn2+ (87%). This showed that the electrode material has a good recycling regeneration ability.
