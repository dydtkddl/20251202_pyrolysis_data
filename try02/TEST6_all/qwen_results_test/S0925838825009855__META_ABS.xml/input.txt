Advancements in tantalum nitride-based films: A review Tantalum nitride (TaN)-based films have attracted significant attentions due to their excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, biocompatibility. Recent studies have increasingly explored how the parameters affect the structure and properties of these films, as well as advances in preparation methods and application exploration. In this paper, a comprehensive review of recent advances in the TaN-based films is presented, including the basic concepts, preparation methods, and factors affecting their structure and properties. Therein, the factors affecting their structure and properties focus on preparation parameters, doping modification and annealing process. Additionally, the applications in the mechanical, biomedical and electronic device fields of the TaN-based films are discussed. In the future, the underling mechanism, accurate evaluation of the service life, and improved preparation techniques need to be further explored for innovating and developing TaN-based films.
