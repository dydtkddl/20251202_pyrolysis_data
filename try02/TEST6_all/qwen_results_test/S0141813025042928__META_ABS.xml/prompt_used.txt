You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma on Dendrobium officinale polysaccharides: Physicochemical and functional properties Dendrobium officinale has garnered significant attention due to its notable bioactivity and health benefits. The polysaccharide extracted from Dendrobium officinale (DOP) is the primary source of its functionality. However, its poor solubility and high viscosity necessitate the modification of its physicochemical properties. This study aimed to investigate the impact of cold plasma treatment on the physicochemical and functional properties of DOP. The results indicated that cold plasma treatment substantially increased the solubility of DOP from 87.5 % to 96.30 % and enhanced its hydrophilicity with a lower water contact angle, primarily attributed to the etching effect of plasma. Furthermore, the study confirmed the co-occurrence of cross-linking and depolymerization during the plasma discharge process. The plasma treatment reduced the viscosity of the polysaccharide solution by 10 folds and increased its thermal stability. The microstructure of the polysaccharide, examined by SEM and AFM, revealed that plasma treatment disrupted the cross-linking structure, leading to smooth agglomeration at high intensity. Moreover, the antioxidant capacity and immunoreactivity of plasma-treated DOP have been improved, and the free radical scavenging rate of the plasma-treated could reach 34.40 % at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, stimulating the secretion of cytokines TNF-α (increased 20.70 %), IL-1β (increased 26.94 %), IL-6 (increased 25.32 %), and IL-10 (increased 13.03 %) in in vitro cell tests. Accordingly, cold plasma treatment could be a novel approach to modifying polysaccharides and improving their potential applications in food and pharmaceutical sectors.
