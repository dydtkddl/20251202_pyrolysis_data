You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress and current status of surface engineered magnetic nanostructures in cancer theranostics Cancer theranostic is the combination of diagnosis and therapeutic modalities for cancer treatment. It realizes a more flexible, precise and non-invasive treatment of patients. In this aspect, magnetic nanostructures (MNSs) have gained paramount importance and revolutionized the cancer management due to their unique physicochemical properties and inherent magnetic characteristics. MNSs have amazing theranostic ability starting from drug delivery to magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic resonance imaging to multimodal imaging in association with radioisotopes or fluorescent probes. Precise regulation over the synthetic process and their consequent surface functionalization makes them even more fascinating. The ultimate goal is to develop a platform that combines multiple diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities based on MNSs. This perspective has provided an overview of the state-of-art of theranostic applications of MNSs. Special emphasis has been dedicated towards the importance of synthetic approaches of MNSs as well as their subsequent surface engineering and integration with biological/therapeutic molecules that decide the final outcomes of the efficacy of MNSs in theranostic applications. Moreover, the recent advancements, opportunities and allied challenges towards clinical applications of MNSs in cancer management have been demonstrated.
