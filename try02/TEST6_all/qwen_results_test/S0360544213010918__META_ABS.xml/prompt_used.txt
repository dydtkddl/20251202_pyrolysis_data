You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mass transfer studies during CO2 gasification of torrefied and pyrolyzed chars A comparative study on CO2 gasification kinetics of flax straw char produced by two different processes, namely, torrefaction and pyrolysis was investigated using a TGA (thermogravimetric analyzer). The objective of this research was to investigate the diffusion and surface reactions that occur during the CO2 gasification of the torrefied and pyrolyzed char particles. Gasification experiments were carried out at four different gasification temperatures from 750 to 900 °C and for different particle sizes (<90 μm–925 μm). The effects of temperature, particle size, and the char type on the rate of CO2 gasification were determined. The 50% conversion rate showed an increase in the reactivity values, along with an increase in the temperature, and decreased with an increase in the particle size for both the char types. The diffusional parameters such as effective diffusivity, effectiveness factor, and the DLI (diffusion limitation index) were calculated from the experimental data for both the char types. BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis were performed to determine the surface area and to study the structural morphology of the char types. Torrefied char had a greater surface area than the pyrolyzed char.
