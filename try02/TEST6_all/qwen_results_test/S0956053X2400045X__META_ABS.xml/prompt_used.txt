You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of mixed engineering plastics: Economic challenges for automotive plastic waste Chemical recycling of complex plastic waste via pyrolysis can reduce fossil resource dependence of the plastics value chain and greenhouse gas emissions. However, economic viability is crucial for its implementation, especially considering challenging waste streams with high shares of engineering plastics that have lower pyrolysis product quality than standard thermoplastics waste. Thus, this study conducts a techno-economic assessment determining the profitability factors of pyrolysis plants for automotive plastic waste in Germany including different plant capacities and calculating cost-covering minimum sales prices for the resulting pyrolysis oil. Main findings are that due to economies of scale, the cost-covering minimum sales prices vary between 1182 €/Mg pyrolysis oil (3750 Mg input/year) and 418 €/Mg pyrolysis oil (100,000 Mg input/year). The pyrolysis technology employed must be robust and scalable to realize these economies of scale. Large plant capacities face challenges such as feedstock availability at reasonable costs, constant feedstock quality, and pyrolysis oil quality, affecting pyrolysis oil pricing. Due to the limited yield and quality of pyrolysis oil produced from these technically demanding feedstocks, policy implications are that additional revenue streams such as gate fees or subsidies that are essential to ensure a positive business case are necessary. Depending on the assessed plant capacity, additional revenues between 720 and 59 €/Mg pyrolysis oil should be realized to be competitive with the price of the reference product heavy fuel oil. Otherwise, the environmental potential of this technology cannot be exploited.
