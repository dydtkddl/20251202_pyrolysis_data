Elucidation of the interaction between ammonium perchlorate and hydroxyl-terminated polyether during co-pyrolysis Oxidizers and binders are indispensable constituents of propellants, but the chemistry of their thermal decomposition remains ambiguous. This study elucidates the cross-interactions between ammonium perchlorate (AP, as an oxidizer) and hydroxyl‑terminated polyether (HTPE, as a binder) in their co-pyrolysis processes by using online single photoionization mass spectrometry and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared methods. The results show that AP significantly promotes the thermal decomposition of HTPE and the formation of products such as light olefins (e.g., propylene and 1,3-butadiene), esters (e.g., ethyl formate), and especially ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane). In addition, the differences in the decomposition temperature ranges and product distributions during the whole thermal decomposition stage between the pure components (pure AP or HTPE) and the AP/HTPE composite components were compared in detail. Two reaction regimes related to the co-pyrolysis of AP and HTPE were proposed at the molecular level (i.e., the reactions between the polyether chain of the HTPE binder and the decomposition products HClO4 and O2 of AP). This work provides a theoretical basis for further understanding insensitive propellants.
