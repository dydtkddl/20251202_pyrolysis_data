You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Iron-based spinel for H2 production and CO2 separation from plastics via chemical looping The integration of chemical looping combustion and hydrogen production using waste plastics as fuel presents a promising strategy for simultaneous CO2 separation and high-purity H2 generation. Iron-based spinel oxides (MFe2O4, M = Co, Mn, Cu, Ni) have emerged as robust oxygen carriers, yet their energy-material flow dynamics during redox cycles remain underexplored. Herein, a comprehensive methodology, combining Aspen Plus simulation with fixed-bed experiment was adopted to systematically assess the performance of four spinel systems. The results indicated that the system exergy efficiencies of MnFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 exceeded 78 %. Improving overall system exergy efficiency depended on the thermal integration of high-temperature gas/steam due to the low exergy utilization efficiency of the coolers. CuFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 were identified as suitable oxygen carriers for CO2 separation in fuel reactor (83.72–99.98 %), whereas CoFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 showed enhanced H2 yields in steam reactor (1.2–3.96 mmol/g OC). Challenges in FeO/Fe regeneration during carrier recycling highlighted the need for redox stability optimization. Notably, NiFe2O4 demonstrated the potential of CO2 separation and H2 co-production, positioning it as a benchmark material for scalable chemical looping systems. These findings provide mechanistic insights into gas quality control and process intensification for sustainable plastic-to-energy conversion.
