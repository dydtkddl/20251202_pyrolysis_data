Iron-based spinel for H2 production and CO2 separation from plastics via chemical looping The integration of chemical looping combustion and hydrogen production using waste plastics as fuel presents a promising strategy for simultaneous CO2 separation and high-purity H2 generation. Iron-based spinel oxides (MFe2O4, M = Co, Mn, Cu, Ni) have emerged as robust oxygen carriers, yet their energy-material flow dynamics during redox cycles remain underexplored. Herein, a comprehensive methodology, combining Aspen Plus simulation with fixed-bed experiment was adopted to systematically assess the performance of four spinel systems. The results indicated that the system exergy efficiencies of MnFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 exceeded 78 %. Improving overall system exergy efficiency depended on the thermal integration of high-temperature gas/steam due to the low exergy utilization efficiency of the coolers. CuFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 were identified as suitable oxygen carriers for CO2 separation in fuel reactor (83.72–99.98 %), whereas CoFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 showed enhanced H2 yields in steam reactor (1.2–3.96 mmol/g OC). Challenges in FeO/Fe regeneration during carrier recycling highlighted the need for redox stability optimization. Notably, NiFe2O4 demonstrated the potential of CO2 separation and H2 co-production, positioning it as a benchmark material for scalable chemical looping systems. These findings provide mechanistic insights into gas quality control and process intensification for sustainable plastic-to-energy conversion.
