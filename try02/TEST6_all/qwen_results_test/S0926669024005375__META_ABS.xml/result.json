  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study involves pyrolysis of a mixture of biomass (walnut and hazelnut shells) and PET, but the primary focus is on bio-oil from biomass, and the pyrolysis of PET is not the main subject; the inclusion of biomass as a major component disqualifies it as a pure plastic pyrolysis study."
