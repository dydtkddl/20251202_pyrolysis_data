You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the performance and emissions of a diesel engine fuelled with bio-oil generated through microwave-assisted pyrolysis of a blend of hazelnut, walnut, and polyethylene terephthalate waste New and renewable energy sources are the most important issue nowadays. Bio-oil which can replace fossil fuel is an alternative source of energy. In this study, the performance effects and emissions of bio-oil produced by microwave-assisted pyrolysis system (MAP) from the walnut shell (WS), hazelnut shell (HS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste mixtures on a single-cylinder diesel engine were investigated. For this purpose, WS, HS, and PET wastes were mixed in two different proportions and converted into pyrolytic oil in the MAP system at 700 watts of microwave power and a 30-minute retention time. Produced pyrolytic oils were converted into bio-oil as S1 (46.25% WS + 46.25% HS + 2.5% PET) and S2 (43.75% WS + 43.75% HS + 7.5% PET) through a 3-stage basic upgrading steps. Experimental results showed that MAP of mixed WS, HS, and PET resulted in high hydrocarbon content bio-oil. In the engine experiments, bio-oil was mixed with diesel at 10%, 20%, and 30% ratios by volume and used in a diesel engine at different Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) (1.4, 2, 2.7, and 3.4 bar). Engine performance has been found to be comparable to diesel at low blend percentages. At 3.4 bar BMEP, while the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of diesel was 712 g/kWh, it was obtained as 832 and 804 g/kWh at S1 and S2, respectively. However, when the emissions were evaluated in general, it was determined that the emission values increased with increasing bio-oil/diesel blend ratios due to the high viscosity, higher density, and low cetane number of bio-oil compared to diesel.
