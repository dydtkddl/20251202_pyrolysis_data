You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent developments of waste tires derived multifunctional carbonaceous nanomaterials The abounding accumulated waste tires would not only cause the massive waste of land resources, but also result in serious environmental pollution. Among the many reported disposal methods, pyrolysis is regarded as a thorough, efficient and environmentally friendly technology for waste tire treatment. Waste tire pyrolysis process mainly produces pyrolytic gas, pyrolytic oil, steel wire, and residual carbonaceous materials, also known as pyrolytic carbon black (CBp), and the former three are well adopted for the energy supply of the whole pyrolysis process, high-value fuel, and alloy steel, respectively, while the low quality of CBp product greatly limits its application and further healthy development of the pyrolysis industry. Hence, this review focuses on the properties, modifications and applications of CBp derived from waste tires for enhanced quality, involving the formation mechanism and the effect of pyrolysis condition on the properties of CBp in detail. Meanwhile, the research progress on various modification methods for CBp material is also presented, including the demineralization, the adjustment of pore structure and surface chemical regulation, as well as the applications of recycled CBp in energy materials, rubber reinforcement and other fields. This review finally puts forward the future development trends and challenges of CBp, expecting the deeper understanding of CBp and the upstream pyrolysis industry with a lot of peer attention, and promoting the high-value utilization of the solid waste resources in various fields.
