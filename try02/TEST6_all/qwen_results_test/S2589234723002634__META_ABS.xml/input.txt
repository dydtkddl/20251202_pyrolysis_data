Recent developments of waste tires derived multifunctional carbonaceous nanomaterials The abounding accumulated waste tires would not only cause the massive waste of land resources, but also result in serious environmental pollution. Among the many reported disposal methods, pyrolysis is regarded as a thorough, efficient and environmentally friendly technology for waste tire treatment. Waste tire pyrolysis process mainly produces pyrolytic gas, pyrolytic oil, steel wire, and residual carbonaceous materials, also known as pyrolytic carbon black (CBp), and the former three are well adopted for the energy supply of the whole pyrolysis process, high-value fuel, and alloy steel, respectively, while the low quality of CBp product greatly limits its application and further healthy development of the pyrolysis industry. Hence, this review focuses on the properties, modifications and applications of CBp derived from waste tires for enhanced quality, involving the formation mechanism and the effect of pyrolysis condition on the properties of CBp in detail. Meanwhile, the research progress on various modification methods for CBp material is also presented, including the demineralization, the adjustment of pore structure and surface chemical regulation, as well as the applications of recycled CBp in energy materials, rubber reinforcement and other fields. This review finally puts forward the future development trends and challenges of CBp, expecting the deeper understanding of CBp and the upstream pyrolysis industry with a lot of peer attention, and promoting the high-value utilization of the solid waste resources in various fields.
