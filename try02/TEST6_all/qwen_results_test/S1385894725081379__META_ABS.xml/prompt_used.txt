You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient continuous waste PLLA degradation via stearyl alcohol-mediated transesterification catalyzed by tin(II) octadecyl alkoxide The chemical recycling of waste poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) into its monomer, L-lactide, offers a promising strategy for establishing a circular economy for PLLA-based polymers. However, conventional approaches typically require high reaction temperatures and suffer from significant side reactions, thereby hindering the efficient recycling of waste PLLA. In this study, we present a low-temperature, continuous depolymerization process for waste PLLA, catalyzed by stearyl alcohol (StOH) and stannous octanoate (Sn(Oct)2) at a mild temperature of 165 °C. This system achieves an L-lactide yield of 99.31 % and purity of 98.02 % (ee = 99.73 %). Characterization of the reaction mechanism, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveals that StOH displaces the octanoate ligands in Sn(Oct)₂ to form tin(II) octadecyl alkoxide. This nucleophilic species interacts with the carbonyl groups of PLLA, promoting chain scission via ligand-assisted attack. The mechanism reduces the energy barrier for backbiting reactions, thereby enhancing the rate of L-lactide formation. This method exhibits strong practical viability, achieving a 97 % yield from real-world PLLA waste and selectively degrading PLLA in mixed plastic streams to enable efficient separation. Furthermore, a simplified continuous processing system was developed, demonstrating stable and sustained PLLA degradation. This work provides an innovative and scalable strategy for sustainable PLLA chemical recycling under mild conditions.
