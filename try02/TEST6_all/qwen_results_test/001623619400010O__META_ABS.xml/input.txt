Application of a general gas-solid reaction model to flash pyrolysis of wood in a circulating fluidized bed Flash pyrolysis of wood in a circulating fluidized bed is studied. The results of a comprehensive gas-solid reaction model are used successfully in analysing the system. The changes in the structure, the transient nature of heat and mass transfer and the reaction scheme are accounted for. All the structural parameters and thermophysical properties are used as continuously changing variables.
