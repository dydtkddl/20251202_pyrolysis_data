You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mass transfer analysis of a concentration-regulated metal-assisted chemical etching system and its application in Si nanohole fabrication This study aims to characterize the mass transfer characteristics of a novel concentration-regulated metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) system and investigate its application in the controllable fabrication of ∼ 600 nm diameter silicon (Si) nanohole arrays. A concentration-regulated MACE system for Si nanohole etching is established, and the CFD simulations of fluid flow, mass fraction evolution, and mass transfer are conducted. Results reveal that the mass fraction distributions from simulations and experiments are in good agreement. As the inlet velocity increases, the average velocity and vorticity significantly increase, the mass fraction approaches the target concentration more quickly, and the mass transfer coefficient increases by 1.51 to 6.72 times compared to conventional MACE. The concentration-regulated MACE system with a fine pore array demonstrates good concentration regulation performance due to its stable mass fraction evolution process, minimal standard deviation of mass fraction, and uniform mass transfer coefficient. Utilizing the concentration-regulated MACE system, the etching rate of Si nanoholes increases by approximately 27.78 % under mass transfer enhancement, and large-area, uniform, high aspect ratio, and controllable tortuous Si nanohole arrays are successfully fabricated for the first time.
