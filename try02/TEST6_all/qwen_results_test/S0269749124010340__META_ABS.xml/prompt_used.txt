You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential in treating arsenic-contaminated water of the biochars produced from hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata and its environmental safety In this study, biochar derived from pyrolyzed aboveground parts of Pteris vittata (P. vittata) was modified with iron(Fe) and applied to aqueous solutions containing arsenite (As[III]) or arsenate (As[V]) for remediation purposes. The adsorption efficiency, biochar characteristics pre- and post-adsorption, microscopic As distribution, and As morphology were analyzed. Additionally, the potential and leaching safety of P. vittata biochar for As-contaminated water remediation were evaluated. Results indicated that P. vittata biochar contained oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic structures. Modification with Fe increased specific surface area and total pore volume. Unmodified P. vittata biochar displayed low adsorption of As(III) and As(V), while Fe modification significantly enhanced As adsorption capacity and reduced As leaching by 69%–89%. Maximum adsorption capacities of Fe-modified P. vittata biochar for As(III) and As(V) were 7.64 and 10.2 mg/g, respectively, as determined by Langmuir fitting. The superior adsorption efficiency of As(V) over As(III) by Fe-modified biochar was attributed to better electrostatic interaction with the adsorbent. Analysis revealed similar As species in P. vittata biochar before and after adsorption, with a significant presence of As(III). Remarkably, As in P. vittata remained highly stable during pyrolysis and adsorption, possibly due to strong Fe–As binding. Fe-modified P. vittata biochar shows promise for application, but further pretreatment may be necessary to achieve optimal results.
