Potential in treating arsenic-contaminated water of the biochars produced from hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata and its environmental safety In this study, biochar derived from pyrolyzed aboveground parts of Pteris vittata (P. vittata) was modified with iron(Fe) and applied to aqueous solutions containing arsenite (As[III]) or arsenate (As[V]) for remediation purposes. The adsorption efficiency, biochar characteristics pre- and post-adsorption, microscopic As distribution, and As morphology were analyzed. Additionally, the potential and leaching safety of P. vittata biochar for As-contaminated water remediation were evaluated. Results indicated that P. vittata biochar contained oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic structures. Modification with Fe increased specific surface area and total pore volume. Unmodified P. vittata biochar displayed low adsorption of As(III) and As(V), while Fe modification significantly enhanced As adsorption capacity and reduced As leaching by 69%–89%. Maximum adsorption capacities of Fe-modified P. vittata biochar for As(III) and As(V) were 7.64 and 10.2 mg/g, respectively, as determined by Langmuir fitting. The superior adsorption efficiency of As(V) over As(III) by Fe-modified biochar was attributed to better electrostatic interaction with the adsorbent. Analysis revealed similar As species in P. vittata biochar before and after adsorption, with a significant presence of As(III). Remarkably, As in P. vittata remained highly stable during pyrolysis and adsorption, possibly due to strong Fe–As binding. Fe-modified P. vittata biochar shows promise for application, but further pretreatment may be necessary to achieve optimal results.
