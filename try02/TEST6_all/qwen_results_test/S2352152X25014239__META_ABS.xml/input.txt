Review of hydrogen storage sustainability using bibliometric and mathematical modeling analysis A primary challenge in utilizing hydrogen is developing economical and secure storage solutions. This study examines cryogenic and adsorptive technologies for biohydrogen storage, emphasizing their operational capacities. Notably, cryogenic storage methods demonstrate a density double that of compressed storage at 70 MPa pressure. The activated carbon adsorption technique offers a viable option for minimizing explosion risks associated with hydrogen storage. Among the materials assessed for high-capacity storage, those derived from African palm oil exhibit a storage capacity of 6.5 wt%, closely followed by bamboo at 6.6 wt% and chitosan at 6.77 wt%, all under pressures ranging from 4 to 20 MPa. Additionally, the review includes hydrogen storage using metals and alloys such as magnesium, approached through nanotechnology. This review comprehensively examines bibliometric analysis utilizing the Scopus database, centered on “hydrogen storage sustainability.” The study of research trends, the number of documents per country, and the number of citations using VOSviewer and Excel revealed that keywords such as “green hydrogen,” “decarbonization,” and “energy transition” are currently trending, offering the potential for further development in sustainable hydrogen storage. A critical consideration involves evaluating mathematical models that incorporate various case studies and designs focused on hydrogen storage. Several case studies have explored different hydrogen storage methods, including underground storage, high-pressure tanks, rapid filling and storage systems, and compressed cryogenic storage. By analyzing mathematical models and bibliometric data, this research can serve as a valuable resource for future scholars aiming to advance the field of sustainable hydrogen storage.
