You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of hydrogen storage sustainability using bibliometric and mathematical modeling analysis A primary challenge in utilizing hydrogen is developing economical and secure storage solutions. This study examines cryogenic and adsorptive technologies for biohydrogen storage, emphasizing their operational capacities. Notably, cryogenic storage methods demonstrate a density double that of compressed storage at 70 MPa pressure. The activated carbon adsorption technique offers a viable option for minimizing explosion risks associated with hydrogen storage. Among the materials assessed for high-capacity storage, those derived from African palm oil exhibit a storage capacity of 6.5 wt%, closely followed by bamboo at 6.6 wt% and chitosan at 6.77 wt%, all under pressures ranging from 4 to 20 MPa. Additionally, the review includes hydrogen storage using metals and alloys such as magnesium, approached through nanotechnology. This review comprehensively examines bibliometric analysis utilizing the Scopus database, centered on “hydrogen storage sustainability.” The study of research trends, the number of documents per country, and the number of citations using VOSviewer and Excel revealed that keywords such as “green hydrogen,” “decarbonization,” and “energy transition” are currently trending, offering the potential for further development in sustainable hydrogen storage. A critical consideration involves evaluating mathematical models that incorporate various case studies and designs focused on hydrogen storage. Several case studies have explored different hydrogen storage methods, including underground storage, high-pressure tanks, rapid filling and storage systems, and compressed cryogenic storage. By analyzing mathematical models and bibliometric data, this research can serve as a valuable resource for future scholars aiming to advance the field of sustainable hydrogen storage.
