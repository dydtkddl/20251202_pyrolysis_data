You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and modeling approach for the optimization of oily water recovered from fast pyrolysis of woody biomass Woody biomass consists of wood chips, leaves, branches, stems etc. They contain highest weight percentage of oily water compared to any other biomass. On woody biomass’ fast pyrolysis, high percentage of FPBO is obtained with char/ash, pyrolytic gases and oily water in considerable amount. The focus of this research is to obtain an optimized temperature at which the oily water recovered from biomass after fast pyrolysis is highest without much affecting the generation of bio-oil. The weight percentage of oily water recovery is affected by several factors- vapor residence time, condensation temperature, operating temperature and moisture content. The weight percentage of oily water is approximately 10.62% with 56.41% of bio-oil generation. The result is obtained at a temperature of 550 °C, further to which increase in oily water content started decreasing the bio-oil generation with very fast rate. This experimental result is analyzed, a surrogate mixture on various assumptions is prepared and a model is prepared using UNIFAC. There is a slight difference in weight percentage of oily water on experimental and modeling approach due to the ageing of surrogate mixture and assumptions in modeling.
