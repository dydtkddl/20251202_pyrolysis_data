Experimental and modeling approach for the optimization of oily water recovered from fast pyrolysis of woody biomass Woody biomass consists of wood chips, leaves, branches, stems etc. They contain highest weight percentage of oily water compared to any other biomass. On woody biomass’ fast pyrolysis, high percentage of FPBO is obtained with char/ash, pyrolytic gases and oily water in considerable amount. The focus of this research is to obtain an optimized temperature at which the oily water recovered from biomass after fast pyrolysis is highest without much affecting the generation of bio-oil. The weight percentage of oily water recovery is affected by several factors- vapor residence time, condensation temperature, operating temperature and moisture content. The weight percentage of oily water is approximately 10.62% with 56.41% of bio-oil generation. The result is obtained at a temperature of 550 °C, further to which increase in oily water content started decreasing the bio-oil generation with very fast rate. This experimental result is analyzed, a surrogate mixture on various assumptions is prepared and a model is prepared using UNIFAC. There is a slight difference in weight percentage of oily water on experimental and modeling approach due to the ageing of surrogate mixture and assumptions in modeling.
