You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-cracking of biomass and waste plastics with sawdust mediated ZSM-5 synthesized via activating gel process Minimizing the catalyst cost is critical to achieving long-term economic feasibility for obtaining bio-chemicals directly from biomass. In the present study, low cost ZSM-5 was synthesized via hydrothermal crystallization of the activated aluminosilicate gel without adding any organic ammonium templates and additional seed crystals. The activation process promoted the depolymerization of the silica-alumina species and the formation of active pasty gel containing nucleation precursors, consequently accelerating the subsequent crystallization reaction. The addition of eucalyptus sawdust (ES) in the synthesis process increased the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) surface area and acidity of the resultant zeolites. The ES-mediated ZSM-5 (AGZ-10) achieved a higher benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) carbon yield (18.9 %) from co-cracking of ES and waste plastics (WP) (ES/WP mass ratio at 1:1) at 500 °C and exhibited better synergistic effect and anti-coking ability compared to the commercial ZSM-5. The results provide an efficient synthetic strategy to produce low-cost zeolites, and a promising technique to effectively utilize biomass and plastic wastes.
