You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing sustainable energy storage with MXenes: A comprehensive analysis of fabrication techniques and applications The pressing need for sustainable energy solutions is causing a prompt progress in the field of energy storage materials. According to this perspective, MXenes have become a class of excellent 2D materials with great potential for providing the energy storage solutions. An extensive review of the synthesis, characterization, and uses of MXenes in energy storage devices is given in this work. The synthesis procedures that have led to the tuning of MXenes, characteristics are described, along with developments in chemical etching and delamination techniques. The structure and composition of MXenes are evaluated by characterization methods like electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, with an emphasis on current advancements. MXenes' contributions to supercapacitor technology and their roles as anode and cathode materials in batteries are discussed, with an emphasis on their electrochemical performance and methods for improving it. Moreover, MXenes' toughness and flexibility are highlighted by an assessment of their prospective applications in difficult situations and their durability in harsh conditions. The superior conductivity, stability, and scalability of MXenes are demonstrated through a comparative examination with comparable 2D materials. All things considered, MXenes present a viable path for developing energy storage technologies and promoting the transition to a cleaner, more efficient energy landscape.
