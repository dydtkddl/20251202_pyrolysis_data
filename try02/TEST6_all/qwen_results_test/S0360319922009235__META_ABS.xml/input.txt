From plastic-waste to H2: A first approach to the electrochemical reforming of dissolved Poly(methyl methacrylate) particles The development of sustainable processes for the recycling of plastic is a major environmental issue to reduce the pollution by this kind of waste. The electro-oxidation of plastic wastes in electrolysers powered by renewable energies is a promising option to produce hydrogen at low temperature while diminishing the energy demand compared to Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Poly (methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) particles, a widely used polymer, were dissolved (0.1–2% wt.) in an isopropanol(IPA)/H2O binary solvent and electro-oxidized on Pt/C-based electrodes in a liquid batch electrochemical cell at 70 °C in acidic media. Despite the dissolution strategy, polymer macromolecules partially block the accessibility of the active sites of a commercial electrode and strongly degrades its electrochemical performances mainly linked to IPA electro-oxidation. The preparation of a more porous electrode supported on carbon paper was found to strongly hinder this deactivation. Furthermore, the electrooxidation of PMMA or PMMA-derived molecules can be performed during cyclic voltammetries up to 1.4 V and chrono-amperometries at 1.4 V.
