You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of wood plastic composite over microporous zeolites The catalytic pyrolysis of commercial wood plastic composite (WPC) over microporous catalysts was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and tandem micro reactor-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TMR-GC/MS). The non-isothermal TG analysis results showed that the decomposition temperatures of polyethylene and polypropylene in the WPC were shifted to lower temperatures by the use of catalysts, from 484 °C to 440 °C over HY(5.1), 457 °C over HBeta(25), and 469 °C over HZSM-5. TMR-GC/MS indicated that the formation efficiency of aromatic hydrocarbons during the catalytic pyrolysis of WPC was affected not only by the catalyst properties, but also by the contact mode between the WPC and catalyst. The in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of WPC showed a higher aromatic formation efficiency than the ex-situ reaction because of the sufficient likelihood of a reaction between the reactant molecules and catalysts during the in-situ reaction. Among the catalysts, HBeta produced the largest amount of aromatics followed by HZSM-5 and HY. Diffusion hindering of the reactant molecules to the small pores of HZSM-5 and the large amount of coke inside the large pores of HY were the main reasons for the lower aromatic formation efficiency over HZSM-5 and HY than over HBeta. Sequential catalytic TMR-GC/MS showed that the increased diffusion hindering effect caused by coke accumulation is the main limitation on the use of HZSM-5. Mesoporous HZSM-5 may be a potential way of overcoming the limitation of the catalysts used in this study.
