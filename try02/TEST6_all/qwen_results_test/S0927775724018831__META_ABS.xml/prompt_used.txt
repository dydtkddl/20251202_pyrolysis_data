You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on the adsorption mechanism of a mixture of seven pharmaceutical compounds on virgin and aged biodegradable microplastics In this study the adsorption of a mixture of seven pharmaceutical compounds on virgin and aged polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics (MPs) was investigated. PLA MPs were aged under UV radiation and simulated solar light (SSL) creating three types of MPs: i) virgin, ii) UV-aged and iii) SSL-aged PLA-MPs. The different PLA-MPs were characterized with various characterization techniques (FTIR, SEM, TGA) which revealed modifications on the surface of the aged MPs like cracks and pits, creating more adsorption sites. Pseudo-first, pseudo-second and the intraparticle diffusion model were applied to explore the mechanism and the rate limiting step of the adsorption mechanism. Isothermal study was also conducted and revealed better fitting with the Freundlich model indicating a multi-layer coverage on the MPs surface. Aging appears to enhance the adsorption capacity of the target compounds on the PLA-MPs for both types of aged MPs however the UV-aged showed higher uptake. Finally, the effect of other parameters, like the pH or the type of the water matrix were also investigated offering a deeper insight on the adsorption mechanism of the target compounds.
