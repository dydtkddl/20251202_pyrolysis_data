Investigation on the adsorption mechanism of a mixture of seven pharmaceutical compounds on virgin and aged biodegradable microplastics In this study the adsorption of a mixture of seven pharmaceutical compounds on virgin and aged polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics (MPs) was investigated. PLA MPs were aged under UV radiation and simulated solar light (SSL) creating three types of MPs: i) virgin, ii) UV-aged and iii) SSL-aged PLA-MPs. The different PLA-MPs were characterized with various characterization techniques (FTIR, SEM, TGA) which revealed modifications on the surface of the aged MPs like cracks and pits, creating more adsorption sites. Pseudo-first, pseudo-second and the intraparticle diffusion model were applied to explore the mechanism and the rate limiting step of the adsorption mechanism. Isothermal study was also conducted and revealed better fitting with the Freundlich model indicating a multi-layer coverage on the MPs surface. Aging appears to enhance the adsorption capacity of the target compounds on the PLA-MPs for both types of aged MPs however the UV-aged showed higher uptake. Finally, the effect of other parameters, like the pH or the type of the water matrix were also investigated offering a deeper insight on the adsorption mechanism of the target compounds.
