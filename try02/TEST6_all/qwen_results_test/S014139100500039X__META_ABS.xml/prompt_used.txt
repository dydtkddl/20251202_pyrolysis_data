You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fluidised bed pyrolysis of polypropylene over cracking catalysts for producing hydrocarbons Polypropylene (PP) was pyrolysed over various catalysts using a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating isothermally at ambient pressure. The yield of volatile hydrocarbons for zeolite catalysts (HZSM-5>HUSY≈HMOR) was higher than that for non-zeolite catalysts (SAHA≈MCM-41). Product distributions with HZSM-5 contained more olefinic materials with about 60wt% in the range of C3–C5. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffin streams with large amounts of isobutane (i-C4) and both catalysts were deactivated during the course of the degradation. SAHA and MCM-41 showed the lowest conversion and generated an olefin-rich product with a rise to the broadest carbon range of C3–C7. Experiments carried out with various catalysts gave good yields of volatile hydrocarbons with differing selectivity in the final products dependent on reaction conditions. The selectivity could be further influenced by changes in reactor conditions; in particular, olefins and iso-olefins were produced by low temperatures and short contact times. It is demonstrated that under appropriate reaction conditions suitable catalysts can have the ability to control both the product yield and product distribution from polymer degradation, potentially leading to a cheaper process with more valuable products.
