You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption and mechanistic study for phosphate removal by rice husk-derived biochar functionalized with Mg/Al-calcined layered double hydroxides via co-pyrolysis Direct or indirect emissions of phosphate from point or non-point sources into aquatic ecosystem may pose serious adverse risks to human life and environmental sustainability. Owing to their environmental and economic benefits, biochar-based adsorption processes have recently emerged as an ideal approach. However, the surface of biochar is normally negatively charged, thus limiting its binding affinity toward anionic contaminants. Herein, in order to address this weakness and further improve adsorption performance, we developed rice husk (RH)-derived biochar functionalized with Mg/Al-calcined layered double hydroxides (RHB/MgAl-CLDHs) via the co-pyrolysis of MgAl-LDH preloaded RH, and we examined its phosphate adsorption properties in aqueous environments. Multiple analyses and phosphate adsorption experiments revealed that the Mg:Al molar ratio (2:1–5:1) and co-pyrolysis temperature (300–700 °C) control the physicochemical properties of synthesized samples and their phosphate adsorption affinities. The molar ratio affects the charge density, whereas the co-pyrolysis temperature determines the surface functionality and porosity. Specifically, RHB/MgAl-CLDHs(2:1/500) (molar ratio = 2:1, co-pyrolysis temperature = 500 °C) exhibited the highest phosphate removal of 97.6% due to the conversion of RH into biochar, decomposition of interlayer water/nitrate, transformation of LDH structures to mixed metal oxides (layered double oxides), and improved porosity, favoring stronger adsorption and intercalation of phosphate. Spectroscopic solid-phase analyses demonstrated that the adsorption mechanism involves the “memory effect” and the formation of both outer- and inner-sphere surface complexes via attractive electrostatic interactions and monodentate/bidentate complexations. In conclusion, considering its high selectivity and excellent recyclability, RHB/MgAl-CLDHs(2:1/500) is a promising material for mitigating eutrophication.
