You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and rice husk by TG–FTIR–MS: Pyrolysis behavior, kinetics, and condensable/non-condensable gases characteristics In this study, pyrolysis behavior, kinetics, and condensable/non-condensable gases characteristics during co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) and rice husk (RH) were evaluated using Thermogravimetric–Fourier transform infrared spectrometry–Mass spectrometry (TG–FTIR–MS). The mass loss was divided into two stages: the main devolatilization and the continuous slight decomposition of macromolecular substances. The pyrolysis behavior was improved during co-pyrolysis, and the interaction between SS and RH showed synergistic and inhibitive effects. The lowest average activation energy was obtained at 30% RH blending; the Diffusion 3D (Zhrualev–Lesokin–Tempelmen) reaction model can fit the pyrolysis process using the Coats–Redfern method. The functional groups and condensable/non-condensable gases (O-H, C=O, C-O, C-H benzene skeleton, CO, CO2) were detected by FTIR, revealing the synergistic effect on the evolution of condensable/non-condensable gases in the promotion of C-O, C=O and CO2 release in blends. The condensable and non-condensable products were detected via MS (including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, CO2, NOx and SOx). The results showed that CO2 was the main gaseous product and confirmed an enhancement of the CO2 release during co-pyrolysis. The release of both hydrocarbons (C2H6, C4H7 +, C4H8) and pollutants (SO, SO2 and toluene) were significantly increased when dealing with pyrolysing the feedstock blend.
