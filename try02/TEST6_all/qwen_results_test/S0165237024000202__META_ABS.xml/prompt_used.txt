You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive analysis of soybean residues pyrolysis products Pyrolysis has been applied to soybean residues from 400 °C to 600 °C to obtain value-added molecules. The biowaste has been previously physicochemically characterized and the temperature effect on products distribution has been evaluated. The results show that the liquid product (bio-oil) reached a maximum yield at 600 °C, while the solid product (bio-char) has a maximum performance at 400 °C. Among the desired products in bio-oil, aromatic hydrocarbons have been improved with the increment of temperature, with a maximum at 550 °C. For non-condensable products, CO2 was the highest emitted compound at all temperatures, together with CO as a consequence of cellulose and hemicellulose thermal decomposition. The minimal CH4 release is caused by the low biomass lignin content. In contrast to previous studies, the majority of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during soybean residue thermal pyrolysis were identified for the first time. Aromatic hydrocarbons were predominant for every temperature, with methylbenzene as the major contributor. The largest relative proportion of aromatics was attained at 450 °C. 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal and 2-methylfuran were found in this phase as meaningful compounds. As for bio-char, it has shown a higher heating value of 5756 kcal/kg. In this way, it could be considered as a good alternative for power generation. Therefore, the great potential of soybean residue pyrolysis products requires an exhaustive analysis.
