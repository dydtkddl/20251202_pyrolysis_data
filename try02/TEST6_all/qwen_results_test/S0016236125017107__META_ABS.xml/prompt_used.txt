You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Energy recovery and critical element immobilization in medical waste-derived fuel: hydrothermal vs. vapor thermal carbonization In response to the rapidly increasing production of medical waste (MW) and the lack of fuel utilization, this study comparatively analyzes hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and vapor thermal carbonization (VTC) as reaction pathways, examining the differences in fuel characteristics, combustion behavior, and the distribution of key elements in the solid products (high-carbon fuels). The results show that the VTC process homogenizes and improves the quality of MW. In contrast, the HTC process has a stronger carbonization ability, converting MW into high-performance solid fuels. The HTC products have higher energy density and carbon content (78.9 %). The VTC process, on the other hand, shows better performance in devolatilization and fixed carbon retention at temperatures below 280 °C. SEM analysis indicates that VTC products have higher surface roughness and larger pores at lower temperatures, demonstrating effective homogenization and improvement in the quality of MW. The HTC process exhibits superior performance in combustion behavior. ICP-OES and XPS results indicate that both processes effectively remove sodium, potassium, and chlorine from MW, with HTC achieving the highest removal rates for sodium and potassium at 260 °C and VTC achieving a higher proportion of inorganic chlorine, exceeding 85 %. These findings provide important references for the fuel utilization of MW and valuable insights for industrial applications.
