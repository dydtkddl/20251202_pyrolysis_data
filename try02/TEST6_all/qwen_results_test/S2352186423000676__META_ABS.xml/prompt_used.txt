You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Machine learning models for the prediction of total yield and specific surface area of biochar derived from agricultural biomass by pyrolysis Organic biomass pyrolysis to produce biochar is a viable approach to sustainably convert agricultural residues. The yield and SSA of biochar are contingent upon the biomass type and pyrolysis conditions, and their quantification necessitates the investment of time, energy, and resources. Therefore, in this study, data from 46 different types of biomass were extracted from the published literature and modeled based on a supervised machine learning approach with five different regression algorithms to predict the total yield and SSA of biochar. In general, the collected data were processed using a data exploration technique to remove outliers. The correlation between input variables was examined using the Pearson correlation coefficient method to eliminate highly correlated input variables, and the assorted data was further imputed for developing predictive models. The yield and SSA of biochar were predicted by feature importance analysis to reduce the computational complexity and latency of the model. Out of the 14 input variables, 9 were selected based on feature importance and redundancy, wherein pyrolysis temperature demonstrated the greatest relative importance of 33.6% in predicting targets. Compared to other models developed to predict total biochar yield and SSA, Random Forests performs better, having a maximum R2 value of 85% and a minimum absolute root mean squared error (RMSE) for both biochar yield and SSA. Therefore, the developed models could help predict total biochar yield and SSA for a variety of agricultural biomasses without the need for complex and energy-intensive pyrolysis experiments.
