You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cyclodextrin-derived materials: From design to promising applications in water treatment Modern lifestyle and industrialization have caused huge pressure on the natural environment. Especially, all kinds of toxic organic and inorganic contaminants are released to aquatic systems, ultimately leading to water pollution and human health risks. Therefore, it is an urgent priority to develop effective strategies for removing these contaminants and realizing water recycling. Cyclodextrins have attracted attention in water treatment due to their precise recognition of molecules and ions. This current review summarizes the latest development of the cyclodextrin-derived materials for water treatment. Cyclodextrin-derived materials are obtained from cross-linking, immobilization or self-assembly to enhance their properties for contaminant removal. Cyclodextrin-derived materials interact with contaminants by host–guest, electrostatic, H-bonding, hydrophobic, and π-π stacking interactions. Further emphasis is put on the applications of cyclodextrin-derived materials for adsorption treatment of various organic and inorganic contaminants, catalytic degradation of organic contaminants, oil–water separation, and membrane separation. Finally, future research directions and challenges of cyclodextrin-derived materials are discussed and summarized. This review offers valuable insight on the development of cyclodextrin-derived materials for water treatment.
