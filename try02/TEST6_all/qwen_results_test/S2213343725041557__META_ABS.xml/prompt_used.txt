You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic insights into Cl transformation and calcium-based dechlorination during pyrolysis of waste plastics: Kinetics, product analysis and process optimization Pyrolysis presents a promising pathway for the chemical recycling of waste plastics. However, the pyrolysis of chlorine-containing plastics can generate hazardous chlorinated compounds. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the migration, transformation, and removal of chlorine during pyrolysis to enable environmentally sustainable recycling. In this study, we combined kinetic analysis with in-situ FTIR and TG-FTIR-MS to elucidate the mechanisms of chlorine migration and transformation during the pyrolysis of chlorinated mixed plastics (CMPs). An efficient dechlorination process using calcium-based additives was also developed. The results indicate that the pyrolysis of CMPs occurs in two distinct stages (Stage Ⅰ and Stage Ⅱ), with average apparent activation energies (Ea) of 166.69 kJ/mol and 243.86 kJ/mol, respectively. The process followed mechanism functions involving diffusion, nucleation, and phase boundary reactions. Initially, weak C–Cl and C–H bonds ruptured preferentially, releasing HCl. This was followed by synergistic cleavage of the main C–C chains, generating radicals such as methyl (·CH₃), butyl (·C₄H₉), propylene (·C₃H₅), and phenyl (·C₆H₅). The combination of these radicals with free chlorine radicals (·Cl) resulted in the formation of diverse and complex chlorinated organic compounds. For dechlorination, Ca(OH)₂ was identified as the optimal calcium-based additive, achieving a chlorine removal efficiency of 97.75 %, attributed to its self-decomposition behavior. This study clarifies the transformation pathways of chlorinated pollutants during pyrolysis and proposes a practical calcium-based dechlorination strategy to support sustainable chlorine management in the valorization of plastic waste.
