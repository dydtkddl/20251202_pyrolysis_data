Structural, thermal, and rheological characteristics of pyrolytically staged condensates in high-pressure pyrolysis of permethylpolysilane A recent development in the industrial manufacture of polycarbosilane is the liquid-gaseous phase pyrolysis polycondensation process which is conducted at high pressure and temperature. Here we report an advanced concept to manufacture liquid carbosilane products with improvements in yield, properties and enriched in valuable low molecular weight oligocarbosilanes. The functional properties of staged carbosilane condensates were examined in relation to their applications as binders and resin matrixes. Structural and bonding networks of low-molecular liquid carbosilanes(L-PCS-1/2) and high-molecular solid carbosilane(S-PCS) were established by applying spectral techniques. L-PCS 1/2 had higher silane content, thermally stable up to 240 °C with ceramic yield of 25–30% wt at 1200 °C. Low-molecular carbosilanes had shear viscosity of 8.2–10 mPa.s with 40% torque while that of high molecular carbosilane was 4150 Pa.s at zero shear rate.
