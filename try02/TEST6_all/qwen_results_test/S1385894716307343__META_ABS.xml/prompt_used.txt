You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of carbon nanomaterials using two-group arc discharge plasma Carbon nanomaterials were prepared using two-group arc discharge plasma method in this study. A combination of an alternating current (AC) arc discharge plasma and a direct current (DC) arc discharge plasma in a fluidized bed was used, in which propane was cracked into carbon blacks (CB) with controlled structure and hydrogen. The effects of parameters such as electrode type, frequency of AC arc discharge, current of DC arc discharge and gas flow ratio (propane/argon) on the synthesis and properties of CB were investigated. A systematic study of the size, morphology, microstructure and surface chemical composition of CB was conducted using various characterization techniques. By using this process, spherical and hydrophobic CB with a narrow size distribution, high degree of graphitization and large specific surface area were produced under optimal experimental conditions. Then, as-prepared CB were used to adsorb heavy-metal ions in water and to reinforce the engineering plastic. The results verified that the adsorption rate of the Cr (VI) ion was increased significantly and that the CB enhanced the electrical and mechanical properties of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS)/natural rubber (NR) composites.
