Optimized liquid hydrocarbon production via co-pyrolysis of Nypa fronds and polypropylene using fly ash catalyst The depletion of fossil fuels and rising carbon emissions highlight the urgency for sustainable energy alternatives. This study explores catalytic co-pyrolysis of Nypa fruticans fronds (NFFs), pretreated with acetic acid, and polypropylene (PP), using fly ash as a low-cost catalyst. The aim was to enhance hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil yield and quality. Experiments at 500 °C under nitrogen varied NFF/PP ratios (100:0 to 25:75) and fly ash loadings (0–15 %). The optimal condition—25:75 NFF/PP with 15 % fly ash—produced bio-oil with 84.02 % hydrocarbons, a heating value of 40.93 MJ/kg, 5.75 cSt viscosity, pH 5.05, and density of 0.78 g/mL. The results show synergistic improvements in fuel quality through plastic blending and catalytic deoxygenation. This work demonstrates the valorization of biomass and plastic waste into liquid fuels and introduces a novel integration of acid pretreatment with fly ash catalysis in NFF-PP co-pyrolysis, contributing to scalable and sustainable waste-to-energy solutions.
