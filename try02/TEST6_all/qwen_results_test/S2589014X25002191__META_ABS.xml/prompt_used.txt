You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimized liquid hydrocarbon production via co-pyrolysis of Nypa fronds and polypropylene using fly ash catalyst The depletion of fossil fuels and rising carbon emissions highlight the urgency for sustainable energy alternatives. This study explores catalytic co-pyrolysis of Nypa fruticans fronds (NFFs), pretreated with acetic acid, and polypropylene (PP), using fly ash as a low-cost catalyst. The aim was to enhance hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil yield and quality. Experiments at 500 °C under nitrogen varied NFF/PP ratios (100:0 to 25:75) and fly ash loadings (0–15 %). The optimal condition—25:75 NFF/PP with 15 % fly ash—produced bio-oil with 84.02 % hydrocarbons, a heating value of 40.93 MJ/kg, 5.75 cSt viscosity, pH 5.05, and density of 0.78 g/mL. The results show synergistic improvements in fuel quality through plastic blending and catalytic deoxygenation. This work demonstrates the valorization of biomass and plastic waste into liquid fuels and introduces a novel integration of acid pretreatment with fly ash catalysis in NFF-PP co-pyrolysis, contributing to scalable and sustainable waste-to-energy solutions.
