Review of atomic layer deposition process, application and modeling tools Atomic layer deposition is a highly sought-after technique with high conformal and quality film deposition. This study reviewed thin-film technology comprehensively and narrowed it to atomic layer deposition. Atomic layer deposition and associated terms and technology were discussed in detail. The study will be helpful to everyone interested in high precision and quality film deposition. The paper also discussed atomic layer deposition models and simulation tools with relevant studies examined. Molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and other models examined atomic layer deposition. Precision control of the sticking coefficients using Langmuir was also discussed. The paper will contribute to the body of knowledge for thin film, atomic layer deposition, modeling, and simulations with diverse real-life applications.
