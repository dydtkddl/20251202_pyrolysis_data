Acesulfame degradation by thermally activated persulfate: Kinetics, transformation products and estimated toxicity The existence of the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACE) in quantities of significance can negatively impact water quality, and its consumption has been associated with deleterious health effects. The present investigation explores the efficacy of heat-activated sodium persulfate (SPS) for eliminating ACE. The complete degradation of 0.50 mg L−1 of ACE was achieved within 45 min under a reaction temperature of 50 °C and 100 mg L−1 of SPS. The impact of thermal decomposition on ACE at a temperature of 60 °C was negligible. This study considers several factors, such as the SPS and ACE loading, the reaction temperature, the initial pH, and the water matrix of the reactor. The results indicate that the method's efficiency is positively correlated with higher initial concentrations of SPS, whereas it is inversely associated with the initial concentration of ACE. Furthermore, higher reaction temperatures and acidic initial pH levels promote the degradation of acesulfame. At the same time, certain constituents of the water matrix, such as humic acid, chlorides, and bicarbonates, can hinder the degradation process. Additionally, the data from LC-QToF-MS analysis of the samples were used to investigate transformation through suspect and non-target screening approaches. Overall, ACE's eight transformation products (TPs) were detected, and a potential ACE decomposition pathway was proposed. The concentration of TPs followed a volcano curve, decreasing in long treatment times. The ecotoxicity of ACE and its identified TPs was predicted using the ECOSAR software. The majority of TPs exhibited not harmful values.
