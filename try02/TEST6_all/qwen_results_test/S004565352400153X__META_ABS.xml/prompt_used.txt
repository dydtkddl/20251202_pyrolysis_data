You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Acesulfame degradation by thermally activated persulfate: Kinetics, transformation products and estimated toxicity The existence of the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACE) in quantities of significance can negatively impact water quality, and its consumption has been associated with deleterious health effects. The present investigation explores the efficacy of heat-activated sodium persulfate (SPS) for eliminating ACE. The complete degradation of 0.50 mg L−1 of ACE was achieved within 45 min under a reaction temperature of 50 °C and 100 mg L−1 of SPS. The impact of thermal decomposition on ACE at a temperature of 60 °C was negligible. This study considers several factors, such as the SPS and ACE loading, the reaction temperature, the initial pH, and the water matrix of the reactor. The results indicate that the method's efficiency is positively correlated with higher initial concentrations of SPS, whereas it is inversely associated with the initial concentration of ACE. Furthermore, higher reaction temperatures and acidic initial pH levels promote the degradation of acesulfame. At the same time, certain constituents of the water matrix, such as humic acid, chlorides, and bicarbonates, can hinder the degradation process. Additionally, the data from LC-QToF-MS analysis of the samples were used to investigate transformation through suspect and non-target screening approaches. Overall, ACE's eight transformation products (TPs) were detected, and a potential ACE decomposition pathway was proposed. The concentration of TPs followed a volcano curve, decreasing in long treatment times. The ecotoxicity of ACE and its identified TPs was predicted using the ECOSAR software. The majority of TPs exhibited not harmful values.
