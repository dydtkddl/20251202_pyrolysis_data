You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A straightforward Py-GC/MS methodology for quantification of microplastics in tap water This study introduces a cost-effective and streamlined Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) methodology for detecting and quantifying microplastics in tap water, focusing on seven common polymers. Unlike conventional approaches relying on expensive pyrolyzate libraries, this method identifies pyrolysis fragments by matching their m/z values with commercially available mass spectral libraries (Wiley Registry 12th Edition/NIST 2020) and confirms findings using pure polymer standards. Recovery was evaluated using two approaches, demonstrating that analysis of the entire filter provided more accurate results compared to extrapolation from subsections. The method exhibited excellent linearity for all targeted polymers (R² > 0.996) and achieved detection limits as low as 0.01 µg for polystyrene (PS) and up to 2.59 µg for polyethylene (PE). Application to tap water samples revealed consistent detection of PS, ranging from 2.532 to 2.571 ng/L in morning samples and 0.867 to 1.540 ng/L in afternoon samples, with polypropylene and PE below the limit of quantification (<LOQ). This method provides a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective tool for routine laboratory analysis of microplastics in tap water and other environmental matrices. • A 23-minute Py-GC/MS method efficiently quantifies microplastics in tap water. • Cost-effective strategy using commercially available mass spectral libraries. • Accurate quantification with ng/L sensitivity validated by pure polymer standards.
