You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Are you drowned in microplastic pollution? A brief insight on the current knowledge for early career researchers developing novel remediation strategies Microplastics (MPs) composed of different polymers with various shapes, within a vast granulometric distribution (1 μm - 5 mm) and with a wide variety of physicochemical surface and bulk characteristics spiral around the globe, with different atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, and terrestrial residence times, while interacting with other pollutants and biota. The challenges of microplastic pollution are related to the complex relationships between the microplastic generation mechanisms (physical, chemical, and biological), their physicochemical properties, their interactions with other pollutants and microorganisms, the changes in their properties with aging, and their small sizes that facilitate their diffusion and transportation between the air, water, land, and biota, thereby promoting their ubiquity. Early career researchers (ERCs) constitute an essential part of the scientific community committed to overcoming the challenges of microplastic pollution with their new ideas and innovative scientific perspectives for the development of remediation technologies. However, because of the enormous amount of scientific information available, it may be difficult for ERCs to determine the complexity of this environmental issue. This mini-review aims to provide a quick and updated overview of the essential insights of microplastic pollution to ERCs to help them acquire the background needed to develop highly innovative physical, chemical, and biological remediation technologies, as well as valorization proposals and environmental education and awareness campaigns. Moreover, the recommendations for the development of holistic microplastic pollution remediation strategies presented here can help ERCs propose technologies considering the environmental, social, and practical dimensions of microplastic pollution while fulfilling the current government policies to manage this plastic waste.
