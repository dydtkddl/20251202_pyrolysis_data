You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Silica embedded cobalt(0) nanoclusters: Efficient, stable and cost effective catalyst for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane Cobalt(0) nanoclusters embedded in silica (Co@SiO2) were prepared by a facile two-step procedure. In the first step, the hydrogenphosphate anion (HPO4 2−) stabilized cobalt(0) nanoclusters were in situ generated from the reduction of cobalt(II) chloride during the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of stabilizer. Next, HPO4 2− anion-stabilized cobalt(0) nanoclusters were embedded in silica formed by in situ hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethylorthosilicate added as ethanol solution. Co@SiO2 can be separated from the solution by vacuum filtration and characterized by UV–Vis electronic absorption spectroscopy, TEM, SEM-EDX, ATR-IR and ICP-OES techniques. Co@SiO2 are found to be highly active and stable catalysts in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) even at low cobalt concentration and room temperature. They provide an initial turnover frequency of 13.3 min−1 and 24,400 total turnovers over 52 h in the hydrolysis of AB at 25.0 ± 0.5 °C. Moreover, Co@SiO2 retain 72% and 74% of the initial activity after ten runs recyclability and five cycles reusability test in the hydrolysis of AB, respectively. The kinetics of hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB catalyzed by Co@SiO2 was studied depending on the catalyst concentration, substrate concentration, and temperature. The activation parameters of this catalytic reaction were also determined from the evaluation of the kinetic data.
