Contrasting roles of CO2 activation and N2 pyrolysis in bamboo shoot shell carbon for thermal energy storage Against the backdrop of escalating research on biomass-derived porous carbons for thermal energy storage, where the carbonization atmosphere profoundly dictates pore architecture and functional performance. This study systematically investigates the roles of CO2 activation and N2 pyrolysis in tailoring bamboo shoot shell (BSS)-derived porous carbons for polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based phase change materials (PCMs). CO2 activation at 900 °C induced hierarchical porosity (specific surface area: 567.1 m2/g, average pore width: 2.17 nm), achieving a 60.47 % PEG encapsulation efficiency. However, the confined pore structure impeded PEG molecular mobility, increasing non-isothermal crystallization activation energy (ΔEa = −160.16 kJ/mol) and prolonging half-crystallization time. In contrast, N2-pyrolyzed carbon (NCB) retained minimal porosity (15.2 m2/g) but higher graphitization, serving as efficient nucleation sites to reduce ΔEa (−153.44 kJ/mol) and enhance photothermal conversion efficiency (87.4 % compared to 85.6 % for CO2-activated composites). Both composites exhibited leak-proof stability and thermal cyclability. This innovation bridges waste-to-energy solutions with renewable energy technologies, expanding the applicability of PCM-based systems in solar thermal devices.
