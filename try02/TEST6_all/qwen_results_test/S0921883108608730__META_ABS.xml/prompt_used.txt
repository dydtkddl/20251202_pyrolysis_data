You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of heterogeneous chemical reactions caused in pyrolysis of biomass particles Abstract -Pyrolysis of woody biomass was studied experimentally with the aim of investigating heat transfer and heterogeneous chemical reactions. In rapid pyrolysis, two different pyrolysis rates were obtained, with different reactions taking place depending on the temperature (a process producing gas and a process producing tar + water). However, the temperature at the transit stage between the two steps for gas differs from the temperature for tar + water. The fact means that there are two processes for gas generation. The experimental results obtained for slow pyrolysis showed that the average temperature in the biomass layer increased slowly as compared with the change in the set temperature. This tendency does not vary over a mean particle size range of 1.1 < D p, 50 (mean particle size) < 11 mm. Numerical simulation of heat transfer in a tubular reactor, without considering chemical enthalpy, was carried out. Comparison of the calculated results with the experimental heat flow rates in the biomass layer revealed two endothermic regions and two exothermic regions. The flow rate of gas generated in the reaction showed two peaks at the exothermic regions. Thus, it was concluded that heat transfer by pyrolysis consists of many processes. Furthermore, we propose a new mechanism representing the heterogeneous chemical reactions involved in pyrolysis, which is divided into four processes: (i) evaporation of water, (ii) decomposition of cellulose, (iii) decomposition of generated tar and (iv) decomposition of lignin.
