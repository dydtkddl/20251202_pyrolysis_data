You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Facile activation of sludge-based hydrochar by Fenton oxidation for ammonium adsorption in aqueous media Lately, there has been a growing interest in converting low-cost biomass residuals, including wastewater sludge, into char-like materials for various applications. In this research, ammonium (NH4 +) adsorption and desorption potential of hydrochar activated via Fenton oxidation were systematically investigated. Hydrochar was prepared from domestic wastewater treatment plant sludge and activated by Fenton oxidation using different H2O2 concentrations, H2O2/Fe2+ ratios, and activation times. The activated hydrochars (AHs) were characterized by ATR-FTIR, high-resolution XPS, BET specific surface area, and SEM, and their NH4 + adsorption capacity was analyzed. The NH4 + adsorption isotherms and kinetics, adsorption in the presence of competing ions (with and without humic acid), and NH4 + desorption were investigated. The results show that following hydrochar activation, the acidic groups’ concentration and the BET surface area increased, but the morphology remained essentially unchanged. It was also found that the activation occurs within a few minutes when using a relatively low concentration of reagents, and without extensive post-treatment steps. The NH4 + adsorption onto AH at equilibrium fitted the Langmuir isotherm model, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 30.77 mg g−1, and the NH4 + adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order model. NH4 + adsorption in the presence of competing ions decreased by up to 33 ± 3%. NH4 + desorption experiments demonstrated that NH4 + recovery can reach 33 ± 5% with ultrapure water and 67 ± 2% with 2 M KCl. The results of this study indicate that Fenton oxidation is a promising alternative for hydrochar activation, and can be used as an adsorbent for NH4 + remediation in wastewater treatment processes.
