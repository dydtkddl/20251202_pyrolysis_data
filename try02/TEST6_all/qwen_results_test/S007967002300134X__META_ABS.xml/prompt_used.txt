You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in polyhydroxyalkanoates degradation and chemical recycling Plastics are nowadays essential to our daily life for a wide range of applications. In order to face the demand of polymer markets, given the depletion of fossil feedstocks from which they are still most commonly produced, and with the aim to develop more ecofriendly plastic materials, the need for renewable and/or recyclable polymers is huge. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a class of polyesters that could meet the challenges of such a circular economy, as they currently stand as promising bio-based, degradable and recyclable alternatives to traditional non-degradable commodity polymers that are polyolefins. PHAs typically feature different side-chain substituents on the repeating units, which beside the stereochemistry along the polymer backbone and the intrinsic characteristics of the macromolecules, are key parameters that dictate and enable tuning of their thermal, mechanical, and recyclability performances. PHAs are thus a large family of versatile polymers that are currently of topical interest in light of their end-of-life options. This review discusses the chemical recycling of natural, biosynthetic and synthetic PHAs, mainly focusing on the most common examples, namely poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), and its related copolymers. The most relevant non-biotechnological approaches, including pyrolysis-type processes, and solvolysis with especially hydrolysis and alcoholysis, whether they are catalyzed or not, are then addressed. The latest advances on the degradation, depolymerization and upcycling of PHAs, show promising outcomes for a close-carbon cycle economy with a favorable environmental impact, as exemplified from the most recent literature.
