You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization strategies and emerging application of functionalized 3D-printed materials in water treatment: A review Access to clean water is a fundamental problem that has been emphasized by the United Nations and World Health Organization. Water is one of the vital necessities for humans to stay alive and prevent disease. However, due to the increasing world population and climate change, it is predicted water resources will be stressed and limited due to poor quality. Various water treatment processes have been developed based on the presence of contaminants in water to solve the urgent issue. Due to the outstanding ability to meet the demands of commercial applications, the newest methods of combining additive manufacturing (AM) and surface functionalization have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement of this field, more advanced, flexible, and efficient surface functionalization strategies for additively manufactured materials have been discussed. The strategy and methods, including etching, deposition processing, surface grafting, and biofilm growth, are summarized concisely, alongside with the surface enhancement property such as antifouling, mechanical and chemical stability and other unique features. In this work, recent advances in functionalized 3D-printed materials used in various water research as mesh, membrane, photocatalyst, scaffold and biocarrier are reviewed. Furthermore, the fundamental issue associated with 3D functional materials is assessed along with the proposed process optimization strategies. Lastly, the challenges and future perspectives of functionalized 3D-printed materials are discussed to develop a novel and versatile approach for functions in the water treatment system.
