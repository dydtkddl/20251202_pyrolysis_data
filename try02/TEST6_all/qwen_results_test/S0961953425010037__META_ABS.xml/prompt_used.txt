You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in biogas using low-cost and eco-friendly extruded adsorbent derived from rubber wood ash Alkaline properties and metal oxide compounds presenting in biomass ash can accelerate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption. However, high pressure is required to drive gas flow when using ash particles. Pelletization of ash is the solution to overcome this problem. The present research aimed to develop an eco-efficiency adsorbent using biomass ash of rubber wood mixed with clay for the adsorption of H2S and CO2 from biogas. Adsorbent pellets were prepared by blending biomass ash with clay as a binder at different proportions (20–40 wt% ash), followed by extrusion and drying either under controlled temperatures (100–500 °C) or by sun drying. For batch operation, among 10 different adsorbents, 80 % and 20 % clay biomass ash baked at 300 °C exhibited maximum H2S and CO2 adsorption. Continuous flow studies were performed to test the biogas upgrading capability of the optimal adsorbent. The highest adsorption capacity, 3.71 mg H2S/g and 10.86 mg CO2/g, at a 0.1 L/min biogas flow rate was achieved. The data for the adsorption were correlated with Thomas, Yoon-Nelson, and Clark models, which showed satisfactory R2 values (≥0.98) confirming the quality of model fit. Economic analysis showed 850 USD per ton adsorbent production cost and with the selling price of 1232 USD per ton, the net present value of the project was 37,290 USD with 69 % internal rate of return and 2 years payback. These findings confirm the viability of utilizing rubber wood ash-based adsorbents as a cost-effective and viable option for use in biogas upgrading applications.
