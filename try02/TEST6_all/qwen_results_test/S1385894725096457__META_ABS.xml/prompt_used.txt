You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing hydrothermal liquefaction of multilayer plastic films for aromatic-rich oil recovery Multilayer films (MLFs) are widely utilized for their barrier protection and flexibility but pose significant challenges in separation and mechanical recycling due to their complex composition. This study addresses this challenge by applying hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) as a novel recycling pathway specifically for multilayer plastic films (MLFs), an understudied yet critical waste stream. A central composite design was employed to investigate the effects of temperature (375–425 °C) and reaction time (2−3h) on product yields and aromatic chemical production. Response surface methodology was used to generate contour plots, revealing the correlation between reaction conditions and the yields of oil, solid, gas, and aromatics. Optimal conditions of 425 °C and 2.5 h resulted in a 70 wt% oil yield. The oil was found to be rich in aromatic compounds, accounting for 91 % of the relative distribution, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), reaching ~48 %. A key novel aspect of this work is the comprehensive economic evaluation, which benchmarks HTL against mechanical recycling, pyrolysis, and incineration. This study demonstrates HTL's potential as an effective method for upcycling MLFs into high-value chemicals like BTEX, offering a strategic pathway toward a circular plastic economy. By converting challenging waste materials into valuable resources, HTL not only addresses recycling challenges but also contributes to sustainable resource management and environmental preservation.
