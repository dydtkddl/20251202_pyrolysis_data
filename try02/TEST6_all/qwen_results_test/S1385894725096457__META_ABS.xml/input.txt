Optimizing hydrothermal liquefaction of multilayer plastic films for aromatic-rich oil recovery Multilayer films (MLFs) are widely utilized for their barrier protection and flexibility but pose significant challenges in separation and mechanical recycling due to their complex composition. This study addresses this challenge by applying hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) as a novel recycling pathway specifically for multilayer plastic films (MLFs), an understudied yet critical waste stream. A central composite design was employed to investigate the effects of temperature (375–425 °C) and reaction time (2−3h) on product yields and aromatic chemical production. Response surface methodology was used to generate contour plots, revealing the correlation between reaction conditions and the yields of oil, solid, gas, and aromatics. Optimal conditions of 425 °C and 2.5 h resulted in a 70 wt% oil yield. The oil was found to be rich in aromatic compounds, accounting for 91 % of the relative distribution, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), reaching ~48 %. A key novel aspect of this work is the comprehensive economic evaluation, which benchmarks HTL against mechanical recycling, pyrolysis, and incineration. This study demonstrates HTL's potential as an effective method for upcycling MLFs into high-value chemicals like BTEX, offering a strategic pathway toward a circular plastic economy. By converting challenging waste materials into valuable resources, HTL not only addresses recycling challenges but also contributes to sustainable resource management and environmental preservation.
