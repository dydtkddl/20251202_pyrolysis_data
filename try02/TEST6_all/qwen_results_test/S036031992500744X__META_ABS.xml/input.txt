Effect of sorghum biomass on hydrothermal co–gasification of PET/HDPE/PP/PVC for hydrogen production This study investigated the effects of sorghum biomass (SB) on the hydrothermal co–gasification (HcG) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high–density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The gasification trials of both individual plastics and SB as well as P/SB combinations were conducted. The effects of adding SB to plastic HcG on total gas volume, mole fraction distribution, hydrogen efficiency, gasified carbon conversion and liquid analysis were examined. The total gas volume obtained from hydrothermal gasification (HG) of individual plastics ranked as PP > PET > HDPE > PVC. In contrast, during HcG, the order changes to PVC/SB > PP/SB > PP/SB > HDPE/SB > PET/SB. The hydrogen efficiency ranking for individual plastics is PP > HDPE > PVC > PET. The hydrogen efficiency of PP is 14.5 (±0.3) mol H2/kg feed. The order of hydrogen efficiency for co–gasification is PVC/SB > HDPE/SB > PP/SB > PET/SB. 16.9 (±0.2) mol H2/kg feed was obtained from co–gasification of PVC/SB, and 20.3 (±0.3) mol H2/kg feed was obtained with the catalyst. The greatest H2 efficiency increase of 6.0 mol H2/kg feed was observed when catalytic conditions replaced HcG of PET/SB. According to GC–MS analysis, aromatics and furfural derivative structures have created shift effects towards phenolic compounds by reducing the product variety in liquid analysis. The study was investigated to determine the effective combination of different types of plastics with biomass for hydrogen rich gas production via HcG. It is envisaged that the use of KCl, one of the most abundant salts in seawater, as a catalyst and the use of plastic wastes as input without any drying and washing process before gasification may have a cost–cutting effect on expensive hydrogen technologies.
