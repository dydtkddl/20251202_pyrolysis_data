You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Changes in physical structure and chemical composition of phosphate rock during calcination in fluidized and fixed beds Abstract The present study deals with the effects of important variables on the calcination of phosphate rock in fluidized and fixed beds. Further, the calcined samples were characterized for variation in physical structure and chemical composition as compared to the raw ore by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury porosimetry as well as BET surface area techniques. Calcination extent was found to increase slightly with gas flow rate. In studying the effect of particle size on calcination in the fluidized bed, the calcination extent increased with decreasing particle size. Calcination in the fluidized bed was found to be faster than that in the fixed bed. The XRD patterns showed that the chief mineral constituents of calcined samples were calcium oxide and fluorapatite, while those in the raw ore were calcite, fluorapatite and carbonate-fluorapatite. The carbonate-fluorapatite changed to fluorapatite during calcination. SEM micrographs of the calcined samples showed that macro pores occur in the carbonate during calcination. In addition, shrinkage and cracks in the surrounding parts of the phosphate due to sintering were observed. The pore size distribution indicated an increase in macro pores and a decrease in micro pores upon calcinations.
