You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

International perspectives on glass waste form development for low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste The global transition to low-carbon energy sources will require a significant contribution of nuclear energy to achieve emission goals. Low-level radioactive wastes (LLW) and intermediate-level radioactive wastes (ILW) are created in various phases of the nuclear fuel cycle for power generation, as well as from nuclear accidents, legacy weapons production, contaminated site decommissioning, and other nuclear activities such as radiopharmaceutical production. In this review, we will summarize recent developments, state-of-the-art glass formulations, and thermal treatment process developments for vitrification of nuclear LLW and ILW from programs in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America. Throughout, we will discuss the selection of glass over other possible waste forms and any special processing considerations due to the nature of the waste. The characteristics of the wastes, such as mixed technological waste, waste coming from dismantling of reprocessing facilities, site decommissioning, and accident site decontamination, are important considerations. This is balanced with the suite of technologies available to vitrify these wastes, e.g., variations of incineration, in-can melting, and plasma treatment. Glass properties and microstructural aspects are compared to give an overview of the versatility of packaging matrices, such as homogeneous glasses, composites, and crystalline matrices. The volume and heterogeneity of the waste, specific radionuclide content, and solubility of components in silicate melts, all factor into the selection of a given waste form, processing route, and technology. Case studies include examples from the United States, United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, France, Australia, Japan, Korea, and China.
