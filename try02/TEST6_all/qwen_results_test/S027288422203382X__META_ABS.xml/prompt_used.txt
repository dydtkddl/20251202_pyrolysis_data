You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photocatalytic sol-gel/P25 TiO2 coatings for water treatment: Degradation of 7 selected pharmaceuticals The effect of different water matrices on the photocatalytic degradation of dissolved pharmaceuticals was explored. The focus was on the degradation efficiencies in wastewater effluent from a bioreactor and water effluent from a central wastewater treatment plant and comparing the results with degradation in deionized H2O. The compounds tested included: oxytetracycline, marbofloxacin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, phenytoin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole. For the experiments performed in this study, a compact packed-bed photocatalytic reactor was used in which the hybrid TiO2 photocatalyst (sol-gel/P25) was deposited on ∼3 mm glass beads. As expected, the reactions proceed more slowly in wastewater than in deionized water, yet it is shown that removal of the compounds from the water is still possible even when other organic molecules are present. Total organic carbon measurements have shown that complete mineralization takes place albeit at slower rates than the initial degradation of parent compounds. The results show that an acidic pH can increase the reaction rates and the adsorption on the photocatalyst surface. Analyses of the degradation intermediates were performed using tandem liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry system. Additionally, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was applied to get insight into the local structure of the photocatalyst before and after use. Understanding the effects that different wastewater compositions have on photocatalytic reactions will help to refine the potential applications of the technology.
