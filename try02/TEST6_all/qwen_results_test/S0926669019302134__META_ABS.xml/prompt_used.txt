You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combined chemical-templated activation of hydrolytic lignin for producing porous carbon Chemical activation and template method using lignin have been considered efficient for producing microporous activated carbon. However, the limited accessibility of micropores and significant chemical consumption hinder the application of aforementioned methods. In order to save attractive properties of both activation routes and to overcome environmental impact, novel combined chemical-templated activation was investigated. A mixture of NaOH and NaCl was employed to produce carbon, which possessed high surface area and versatile porous structure. The process was optimised and described by mathematical models using the response surface method (RSM). The BET surface area and yield were selected as output performances (responses), whilst temperature, time and chemical ratio were chosen as variable inputs (factors). Macropore sizes were of the same NaCl crystal size confirmed by XRD and SEM indicating a template mechanism. Micropore origin was suggested by chemical reactions between NaOH and carbon with a formation of Na2CO3 confirmed by XRD standard patterns and corresponding FTIR peaks. According to RSM design, the most significant factor is chemical ratio for both responses. The experimental data of the BET surface area is in a good validity of the quadratic model, while yield matched the linear model well according to the ANOVA test. In this study, porous carbon was produced by new method overcoming the major challenges of templated and chemical activation and brings added value of lignin.
