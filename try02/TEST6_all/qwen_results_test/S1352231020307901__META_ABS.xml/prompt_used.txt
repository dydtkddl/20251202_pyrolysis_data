You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Occurrence of both nonvolatile and semivolatile carbonaceous air particulate markers using thermal desorption-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry Particulate matter (PM) occurring in the atmosphere is a complex mix of organic species that originate from many sources due to long range transport. Many anthropogenic and biogenic sources have unique chemical components that enable their use as atmospheric markers of emissions. Application of thermal desorption–pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-Pyr-GC-MS) enabled the characterization of both semivolatile and nonvolatile atmospheric markers in PM, both of which are difficult to characterize using traditional TD or solvent extraction alone. The nonvolatile organic PM fraction was found to be significant based on thermal optical analysis (TOA) quantification, with 73–87% of organic carbon (OC) evolving at temperatures above 400 °C (i.e., Pyr). The semivolatile organic carbon (SVOC) fraction (i.e., TD) of PM featured distinct profiles of alkanes, fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters and 2-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mostly associated with biogenic origin. By contrast, in the Pyr fractions of carbonaceous PM, highly abundant homologous series of n-alkenes, n-alkylbenzenes, PAHs, n-alkanes, and substituted phenols were identified. The occurrence of these compounds is conveyed through newly developed pyrolytic indicators reflecting the breakdown of biogenic sources, e.g., plant lipids, although certain sampling periods showed a contribution of anthropogenic origin. These previously unresolved biogenic and anthropogenic Pyr profiles provide a more representative characterization of atmospheric PM that can help in identifying emission sources.
