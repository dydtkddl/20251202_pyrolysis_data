You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of fiber reinforced composites: Online mass spectrometric tracing, offline physicochemical speciation and toxicological evaluation of a pilot plant pyrolytic conversion The increasing demand for lightweight materials with exceptional stability and durability has resulted in a significant rise in fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) production. These materials find applications in various fields. However, the exceptional properties and diverse compositional range of FRPs pose challenges to conventional recycling strategies. Pyrolysis has emerged as a highly promising approach for separating the fibers from the polymer matrix. In this study, we employed thermal analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the pyrolysis process. Representative FRP showed a starting decomposition temperature of 300 °C and bisphenol A, styrene, alkenes, and phenols could be identified. The identified parameters were used to operate a pilot plant with a capacity of up to 50 kg/h FRP, and reactor products were directly analyzed with soft photoionization mass spectrometry. The findings demonstrated good agreement between the pilot plant results and laboratory experiments, particularly for smaller compounds (m/z<200). The non-condensable fraction showed a range of 17 to 22 MJ/m3 as lower heating value. Analysis of the recovered fibers (diameter between 6.20 and 8.05 μm) revealed residual coke, but no toxic fibers were detected, according to the World Health Organization's definition. Yet, the organic coating of the fibers contained small amounts of potentially harmful PAHs. A toxicological assessment using a multicellular in vitro model confirmed the low hazardous potential of the recovered fibers. The findings contribute to developing sustainable and environmentally friendly recycling strategies for FRP while addressing important aspects related to the safety and toxicological implications of the resulting chemicals and fibers.
