You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nitrogen-doped nanostructured carbons: A new material horizon for water desalination by capacitive deionization Capacitive deionization (CDI) is regarded as a novel, low-cost, and environmentally friendly technique that plays a critical role in desalination and water treatment. Although much progress has been achieved, the development of better CDI technologies, especially through the design and synthesis of various porous carbonaceous materials with enhanced CDI performance, continues to attract increasing interest within the scientific fraternity. Considering that previous traditional porous carbons might suffer from deficient salt adsorption capacity, the nitrogenization of porous carbons, which brings new opportunities for CDI applications, has emerged as an effective strategy to modify the surface characteristics of porous carbons and ultimately improve their CDI performance. This review summarizes the recent significant breakthroughs on the construction of NCs, including in situ doping and post-treatment strategies, and their practices in the field of CDI to impart a comprehensive understanding of the strategic evolution of the synthetic approaches to nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) with remarkable CDI characteristics. We present an exhaustive analysis of newly synthesized NCs and the impact of their compositional and structural features on their CDI performance; further, we highlight a special emphasis on the possible role of nitrogen dopants in the CDI process. In addition to elucidating the state-of-the-art CDI applications, we address the remaining challenges, and finally, the possible direction for the use of NCs for CDI is described to provide some useful clues for future developments in this promising field.
