Co-pyrolysis of biomass and different plastic waste to reduce hazardous waste and subsequent production of energy products: A review on advancement, synergies, and future prospects Global energy consumption has increased as a result of a growing population and industrialization, leading to a number of complications such as fossil fuel exhaustion, electrical shortages, and pollution. Due to these challenges, it was necessary to discover and apply abundant renewable energy sources, especially biomass, using thermochemical conversion methods such as co-pyrolysis. Synergistic improvements can be made to fuel and value-added products by using plastic waste and solid biomass feedstock mixtures. The present research provides an indication of earlier investigations, current achievements, and upcoming possibilities in the co-pyrolysis of solid biomass and plastic waste for the generation of superior-quality biofuels. The properties of key plastic waste components are addressed, with an emphasis on the synergistic benefits that may be obtained by co-pyrolyzing them with biomass. A range of state-of-the-art experimental methodologies for the co-pyrolysis study is assessed using different types of reactors. The obstacles and prospects for advancement in the co-pyrolysis of various solid biomass and plastic waste mixes are also highlighted. This critical evaluation indicated that co-pyrolysis of solid biomass with plastic waste is more advantageous than typical biomass pyrolysis independently and it is a simple, effective, and optional method of accomplishing effective waste management, boosting energy security, and lowering reliance on fossil fuels.
