You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD-based coupled multiphase modeling of biochar production using a large-scale pyrolysis plant This paper presents a combined CFD simulation of the thermal conversion of biomass to biochar and the co-combustion of air and biomass volatiles with non-premixed swirl air and volatiles in an industrial pyrolysis plant. The main objective of this study is to investigate thermal conversion process in indirect biochar plants taking into accounts the main challenges associated with biochar production. The model is based on the implementation of calculations on the thermal conversion of biomass in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) environment. Several sub-models have been introduced to simulate the thermal conversion of biomass to biochar, taking into consideration heat and mass transfer, drying, pyrolysis and volume shrinkage. A non-uniform heat flux obtained by simulating the non-premixed co-combustion of the swirl propane burner and the wood volatile gas has been implemented as an inlet boundary condition in the pyrolysis section. The feasibility of the self-ignition of wood volatiles has been investigated. Uniformity of heat transfer rate between thermal oxidizer and pyrolysis section and lower moisture content in the feedstocks play a remarkable role in producing higher quality of biochar and minimizing residence time in indirect slow pyrolysis plants.
