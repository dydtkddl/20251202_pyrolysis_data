You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photooxidative and pyrolytic degradation of methyl methacrylate-alkyl acrylate copolymers Different compositions of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methyl acrylate) (PMMAMA), poly(methyl methacrylate-co-ethyl acrylate) (PMMAEA) and poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) (PMMABA) copolymers were synthesized and characterized. The photocatalytic oxidative degradation of all these copolymers were studied in presence of two different catalysts namely Degussa P-25 and combustion synthesized titania using azobis-iso-butyronitrile and benzoyl peroxide as oxidizers. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weight distribution of the samples as a function of time. The GPC chromatogram indicated that the photocatalytic oxidative degradation of all these copolymers proceeds by both random and chain end scission. Continuous distribution kinetics was used to develop a model for photocatalytic oxidative degradation considering both random and specific end scission. The degradation rate coefficients were determined by fitting the experimental data with the model. The degradation rate coefficients of the copolymers decreased with increase in the percentage of alkyl acrylate in the copolymer. This indicates that the photocatalytic oxidative stability of the copolymers increased with increasing percentage of alkyl acrylate. From the degradation rate coefficients, it was observed that the photocatalytic oxidative stability follows the order PMMABA > PMMAEA > PMMAMA. The thermal degradation of the copolymers was studied by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The normalized weight loss and differential fractional weight loss profiles indicated that the thermal stability of the copolymer increases with an increase in the percentage of alkyl acrylate and the thermal stability of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-alkyl acrylate)s follows the order PMMAMA > PMMAEA > PMMABA. The observed contrast in the order of photostability and thermal stability of the copolymers was attributed to different mechanisms involved for the scission of polymer chain and formation of different products in both the processes.
