An innovative method for optimizing continuous torrefaction in a helical screw-induced rotational fluidised bed reactor: Merging flow dynamics, energy efficiency, and biomass pretreatment to augment biochar production This study investigates the optimization and performance of a novel Helical Screw-Induced Rotation (HSIR) fluidized bed reactor for the continuous torrefaction of palm kernel shell (PKS). A hybrid Design of Experiments (DOE) approach was employed, integrating Face-Centered Central Composite Design (FCCD), Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and advanced statistical analyses to capture nonlinear effects and interactions among critical variables: reactor temperature (240–320 °C), feed rate speed (FRS), and helical screw rotation speed (HSRS). This combined optimization strategy represents a methodological advancement over conventional single-design approaches, enabling more robust prediction of reactor hydrodynamics and performance. The optimal operating condition (280 °C, FRS 50 rpm, HSRS 40 rpm) yielded biochar with a calorific value of 24.12 MJ·kg−1, a mass yield of 0.72 %, and a mean residence time of 17.67 min. To comprehensively evaluate process performance, novel indicators were introduced, including Energy Conversion Efficiency (ECE), Degree of Torrefaction (DoT), and Reactor Throughput Efficiency (RTE), achieving maximum values of 95.5 % and 20.36 g·min−1, respectively. Furthermore, water-washing pretreatment (75 °C, 6 h) effectively reduced alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs), decreasing ash content and improving devolatilization, hydrophobicity, grindability, and thermal stability. The integration of multi-variable optimization with pretreatment and Residence Time Distribution (RTD)-based reactor analysis establishes a novel framework for intensifying biomass torrefaction and advancing PKS as a scalable renewable feedstock for sustainable energy and material applications.
