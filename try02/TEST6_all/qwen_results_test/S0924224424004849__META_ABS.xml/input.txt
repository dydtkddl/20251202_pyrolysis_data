Pectin and pectic oligosaccharides (POS): Recent advances for extraction, production, and its prebiotic potential Background Pectin is an important dietary fiber present in human diet and is used as additive for several purposes, being that their hydrolysis for production of pectic oligosaccharides (POS) has been extensively reported in the last years, making it a potential functional ingredient mainly because their prebiotic effects. Therefore, it is essential the critical analysis of the most advances about ecofriendly methods for the extraction of pectin and POS production, as well as the role of structure features on their biological activities, being the relationship between these molecules and gut microbiota modulation one the most relevant approach. Scope and approach This review discusses up-to-date insights into the applicability and efficiency of conventional, enzymatic, emerging technologies and natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) in the extraction of pectins, and the main methods for employed for POS synthesis, including enzymatic, chemical and novel technologies. It emphasizes the role of these approaches in the yield, chemical features, and their advantages and limitations. Finally, the prebiotic effect of pectins and POS are discussed. Key findings and conclusions Unconventional raw materials have shown potential as substrates for obtaining pectins. While acid extraction is well-established, technologies like ultrasound and microwave combined with organic acids offer improved efficiency. Moreover, the use of green solvents such as NADES, and other technologies are a growing trend. Emerging technologies also allow chemical-structural modification of pectins, and when combined with enzymatic or chemical methods, they enable the production of diverse POS with prebiotic effects. Based on the recent evidence, both pectins and POS can improve gut and host health, though more research is needed to understand their specific mechanisms in in vivo models.
