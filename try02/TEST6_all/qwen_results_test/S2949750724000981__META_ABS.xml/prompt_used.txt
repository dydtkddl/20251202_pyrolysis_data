You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of pyrolysis temperature on the physical and chemical characteristics of pine wood biochar Biochar is a useful bioproduct with a wide range of promising applications. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of pyrolysis temperatures on the physicochemical properties of biochar produced from pine wood using a slow pyrolysis methodology. Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis uncovered that the biochar synthesized at the different temperatures selected possessed distinct functional groups. The elemental analysis confirmed that an increase in pyrolysis temperature led to a rise in the carbon (C) concentration, whereas conversely there is a reciprocal decrease in the levels of oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H). Consequently, biochar produced at high temperatures showed low (O/C) and (H/C) fractions. Surface area (gas adsorption) studies indicated that the biochar surface area and pore volume increase at higher pyrolysis temperature. In contrast, the pore size was found to decrease at high temperatures. It was found that increased pyrolysis temperature resulted in reduced biochar yield. Biochar for use in specific applications like as an adsorbent material is ultimately influenced by the pyrolysis temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that the results of the current study enhances the understanding on the effect of pyrolysis temperature on biochar synthesis and how different parameters can be used to tailor the material characteristics for specific applications.
