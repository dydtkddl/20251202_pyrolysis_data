You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pioneering new paths in sodium-ion batteries: A comprehensive review towards binder-free anode and cathode materials for next-generation energy storage Significant technological advancements have improved the efficiency and reduced the cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), making them a leading energy storage solution. Despite their high power and energy density, concerns over lithium resource availability, cost, and the need for higher energy density have driven the search for “beyond Li-ion” technologies. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative due to their similar working principles and manufacturing processes to LIBs. A major component in conventional battery electrodes is the binder, used to hold active materials and conductive additives together. However, binders are often electrochemically inactive, insulating, and mechanically unstable, which can hinder performance by reducing conductivity, causing uneven material distribution, and limiting cycle stability. In contrast, binder-free electrodes offer several advantages, such as higher surface area, better adhesion to current collector, and improved tolerance to volume changes during cycling. These features contribute to enhanced electronic conductivity, improved electrochemical reversibility, and better overall battery performance. This review highlights recent advancements in binder-free anode and cathode materials-including metals, carbon-based structures, MXene, and hybrids-along with novel synthesis strategies. The discussion also covers their impact on rate capability and cycle life, and outlines the current challenges and future directions for realizing practical applications of SIBs. In addition, this review provides an integrative perspective by covering diverse material platform and latest fabrication methods, offering a timely road map for the advancement of the binder-free sodium ion battery technologies.
