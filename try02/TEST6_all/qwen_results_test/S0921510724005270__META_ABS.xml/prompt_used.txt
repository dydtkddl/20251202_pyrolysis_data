You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A state of review for graphene-based materials in preparation methods, characterization, and properties The advancement of the modern flexible and bendable technology has sparked increasing interest among researchers in graphene-based materials. When graphene and its derivatives are used as rubber reinforcement, the wear resistance and mechanical properties of the composite can be improved, suitable for smart wearable devices and protective materials. In this paper, preparation methods, characterization techniques and properties of graphene-based materials including graphene, graphene oxide (GO) and graphene/rubber nanocomposites are summarized. First of all, a comprehensive review of various methods for synthesizing graphene-based materials is presented, with an emphasis on their respective advantages and limitations. The subsequent discussion focuses on a range of characterization methods used to determine structure, morphology, and purity of graphene-based materials. It is final that the introduction of graphene-based materials in various properties encompassing their exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity, remarkable mechanical strength, as well as outstanding chemical stability, which make them widely used in electronics, catalysts, sensors and other related fields. The aim of this artical is to provide reference for the preparation of graphene-based materials, further promoting their research and application in the diversified fields.
