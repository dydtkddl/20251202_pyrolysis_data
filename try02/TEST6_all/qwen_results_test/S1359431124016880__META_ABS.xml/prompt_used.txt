You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic evaluation of decarbonized power production based on solar energy integration This study aims to create an environmentally friendly system by utilizing solar and biomass energies as renewable sources, employing high temperature and pressure ranges for analysis. A new energy system is introduced, using biomass to produce hydrogen and other valuable commodities. The study evaluates power and hydrogen production technologies from a thermodynamic perspective, including conventional biomass gasification, calcium and iron thermochemical looping cycles, and gasification with supercritical water, incorporating carbon capture techniques. It assesses and compares the performance of locally available biomass material, such as cotton stalk, during gasification. Results show that employing the supercritical water gasification cycle yields the highest hydrogen production (8330 kg/h) and carbon capture rate (92.91 %), with potential for significant reduction in CO2 emissions. Supercritical water gasification also demonstrates electricity, heating, and CO2 production rates of 51.48 MW, 23.3 MW, and 16.6 MW, respectively. Integrating supercritical water gasification with solar energy enhances syngas productivity and system efficiency. Additionally, the highest performance is demonstrated in the SCWG case, which exhibits the lowest irreversibility at 320.32 MW. In conclusion, the system with supercritical water gasification emerges as the most efficient biomass conversion method, with higher energy and exergy efficiencies of 67.59 % and 49.74 %, respectively, under specific operating conditions. The developed model facilitates integration of solar energy into biomass gasification, enabling prediction and comparison of performance in terms of energy and exergy efficiencies.
