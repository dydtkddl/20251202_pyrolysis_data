You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling of sustainable methanol production via integrated co-gasification of rice husk and plastic coupled with its prediction and optimization using machine learning and statistical-based models To reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate environmental impact, co-gasification of waste materials presents a promising alternative for methanol production. In modeling gasification process, kinetic-based models are predominant but are often complex and lack inherent optimization capabilities. This study couples a kinetic-based model with predictive models, aiming to provide an optimization-embedded and simplified simulation approach. Using Aspen Plus, an integrated model for methanol production via co-gasification of rice husk and plastic was developed. Model prediction and optimization were performed using response surface methodology (RSM) as a statistical approach and artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) as a machine learning approach. Key input variables, including gasification temperature (GT), steam-to-feed ratio (STF), methanol production temperature (T) and pressure (P), were optimized for both the co-gasification and methanol sections. The integrated co-gasification-methanol model was successfully developed, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.31 when validated with experimental data. Predictions using both ANN-GA and RSM methods yielded a coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.99, with ANN-GA showing superior prediction accuracy. Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) from the RSM results also confirmed the model significance. The optimal methanol yield was 0.6 kg/kg feed under GT = 850 °C, STF = 0.96–1.73, T = 234–255 °C, and P = 114–150 bar. While ANN-GA provided superior optimization across most variables, RSM was more effective for optimizing pressure. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating machine learning and statistical models with kinetic-based simulations for optimizing an integrated gasification-methanol system.
