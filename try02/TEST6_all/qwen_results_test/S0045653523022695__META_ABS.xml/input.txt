Microplastics and biobased polymers to combat plastics waste Microplastics (MPs) have become the major global concern due to their adverse effects on the environment, human health, and hygiene. These complex molecules have numerous toxic impacts on human well-being. This review focuses on the methods for chemically quantifying and identifying MPs in real-time samples, as well as the detrimental effects resulting from exposure to them. Biopolymers offer promising solutions for reducing the environmental impact caused by persistent plastic pollution. The review also examines the significant progress achieved in the preparation and modification of various biobased polymers, including polylactic acid (PLA), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), lignin-based polymers, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), and poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA), which hold promise for addressing the challenges associated with unplanned plastic waste disposal.
