You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on recent advances in cellulose nanofibril based hybrid aerogels: Synthesis, properties and their applications With the depletion of fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns, the modernized era of technology is in desperate need of sustainable and eco-friendly materials. The industrial sector surely has enough resources to produce cost-effective, renewable, reusable, and sustainable raw materials. The family of very porous solid materials known as aerogels has a variety of exceptional qualities, such as high porosity, high specific surface area, ultralow density, and superior thermal, acoustic, and dielectric properties. As a result, aerogels have the potential to be used for many different purposes, such as absorbents, supercapacitors, energy storage, and catalytic supports. Recently, cellulose nanofibril (CNF) aerogels have attracted remarkable attention for their large-scale utilization because of their high absorption capacity, low density, biodegradability, large surface area, high porosity, and biocompatibility. Recent advancements have confirmed that CNF-based hybrid aerogels can be proposed as the most privileged and promising novel material in various applications. This comprehensive review highlights the recent reports of the CNF-based hybrid aerogels, including their properties and frequent preparation approaches, in addition to their new applications in the areas of fire retardant, water and oil separation, supercapacitors, environmental, and CO2 capture. It is also assumed that this article will promote additional investigation and establish innovative capabilities to enhance novel CNF-based hybrid aerogels with new and exciting applications.
