You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Wheat straw/HDPE co-reaction synergy and enriched production of aromatics and light olefins via catalytic co-pyrolysis over Mn, Ni, and Zn metal modified HZSM-5 The co-reaction synergy of wheat straw (WS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic waste with varying mass ratios were evaluated at 550 °C in a fixed bed pyrolyzer reactor. Ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of WS and HDPE feed mix (3:1) at a high feed to catalyst ratio (10:1) was performed over Mn, Ni, and Zn (1, 5, and 10 wt%) metal-modified HZSM-5 at 550 °C to study the effect of metal promotors variations on the production of aromatics and light olefins. The prepared catalysts were characterized by employing XRD, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and UV-Vis analytical techniques. The results obtained in the present work indicated that 1%-Zn modified HZSM-5 produced a more relative proportion of aromatics (25.12%) in the co-pyrolysis oil organic phase, followed by 5% Ni and 5%-Zn-loaded HZSM-5 at 16.22% and 15.76% respectively. Furthermore, 5% Ni-HZSM-5 has shown higher deoxygenation ability (58.43%) in reducing the oxygenates formed, followed by 5% Mn (40.96%) and 1% Zn (35.37%) respectively. While, 5% Mn-HZSM-5 generated pyrolytic gases with higher volumetric compositions of (C2-C4) light olefins at 15.84%, followed by 1% Mn (13.97%) and 10% Ni (13.61%) respectively and these volumetric yields were strongly correlated with intermediate acidity of catalysts. The physical properties (e.g. HHV ~ 41–43 MJ/kg) of the resultant organic fraction of catalytic co-pyrolysis bio-oil are almost analogous to conventional fuels such as diesel and light fuel oil (LFO). Additionally, the resultant catalytic pyrolytic gases possessed excellent calorific value (LHV ~ 30–31 MJ/Nm3) and are comparable to natural gas. Overall, the present study has successfully demonstrated the promising nature of the catalytic co-pyrolysis process for the conversion of biomass and waste plastic into useful chemicals and fuels.
