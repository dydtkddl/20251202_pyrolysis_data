Investigation of thermochemical conversion of biomass in supercritical water using a batch reactor This study focused on gasification of biomass and a biomass model compound. Data are presented that show the presence of supercritical water enhances gasification efficiency, as it participates as both a solvent and a reactant. It is established that biomass gasification efficiencies are in the same range for all types of biomass. The thermodynamic changes of state are functions of elemental composition, not biomass species. The oxidation state of carbon atom of biomass is a key variable in determining the changes in enthalpy during both conventional combustion and supercritical water gasification. The oxidation state of the feed (together with the reaction conditions that influence the degree to which water participates as a reactant) also determines the vapor product composition. Decomposition reactions to vapor products are rapid and complete at high temperature (⩾550°C), catalytic mediation is not required. Temperature and residence time are important operating parameters for SCW gasification. Less important are the pressure of gasification (in the range of 40–67MPa) and the presence of catalyst. The vapor yield, gas composition, the carbon and hydrogen balance of SCW gasification are functions of gasification temperature, residence time and biomass load (concentration).
