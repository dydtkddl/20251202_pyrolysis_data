You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam reforming of plastic pyrolysis model hydrocarbons and catalyst deactivation Catalytic steam reforming of n-hexane, 1-hexene, tetradecane and toluene over a Ni commercial catalyst has been carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at 700°C. These compounds have been selected as model compounds of the volatiles formed in the pyrolysis of waste plastics in order to study in detail the performance of the catalyst in the pyrolysis-reforming of different plastic wastes. High carbon conversions and hydrogen yields are obtained at zero time on stream, with peak values being 96.5% and 82.8%, respectively, when n-hexane is used as model compound. Similar reactivity has been observed for tetradecane and 1-hexene, whereas lower carbon conversion (82%) and hydrogen yields (65%) are obtained for toluene. Concerning catalyst stability, olefinic compounds (1-hexene) and aromatic compounds (toluene) cause faster catalyst deactivation than paraffinic compounds (tetradecane and n-hexane). These disparities are explained by the different nature of the coke deposited and the different potential of the compounds to block Ni active sites, with olefins and aromatics being encapsulating coke precursors (amorphous and structured, respectively) and paraffins being filamentous and inert coke precursors.
