You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Blended torrefaction of combustible construction solid wastes and paper sludge on its combustion characteristics and migration of heavy metals and Cl Combustible construction solid wastes (CCDW) and paper sludge (PMS) are important components of combustible solid waste (CSW), which are also important ingredient in waste-to-energy system. Torrefaction experiments of CCDW, PMS and their blends in equal proportion (C50S50) were conducted in a tubular furnace reactor at torrefaction temperature (T) of 200–400 °C for 30 min. The fuel properties and migration of heavy metals and Cl of torrefied CCDW, PMS and C50S50 were investigated based on proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, caloric value determination, and the measurement of heavy metals and Cl in solid, liquid and gaseous products. Combustion characteristics of CCDW, PMS, C50S50 and their torrefied solid products were evaluated by TG-FTIR analyzer. The obtained results indicated that torrefaction can improve fuel performance of CCDW, PMS and C50S50. The fixed carbon, higher heating value (HHV) of torrefied solid products increased and volatile matter decreased gradually while T 250 °C. The combustible index (C n ) and burnout index (S) of blended torrefied products at 250 °C were the largest, achieving 111.26 × 10−6 and 0.49 × 10−6. Torrefaction can effectively remove Zn, Hg, As in CCDW, PMS and C50S50. More than 50 % of Cl was released from torrefied C50S50 when T > 300 °C. High torrefaction temperature (T > 300 °C) can remove more heavy metals and Cl, but it has an adverse effect on fuel properties of torrefied products, so the suggested torrefaction temperature is 250 °C.
