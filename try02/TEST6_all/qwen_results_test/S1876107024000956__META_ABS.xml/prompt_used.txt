You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on green adsorbent from plastic waste-derived char for wastewater treatment: Production, aqueous contaminants adsorption, and applications Background Plastics, ubiquitous in municipal solid waste globally, consistently negatively influence the environment. Therefore, it is imperative to recycle them conscientiously. Through the application of thermal pyrolysis, plastics can be transformed into biochar, exemplifying a sustainable and innovative approach to waste management. Methods The primary goal of this work was to thoroughly review the literature on fast pyrolysis of plastic waste, focusing on char formation and its potential applications in wastewater treatment. The analysis found that fast pyrolysis technologies play a crucial role in this complex process. An exact evaluation study was performed to examine the unique features shown by various polymers following their thermochemical conversion into char. Significant findings This study provides the first thorough assessment, highlighting the promising prospects of plastic waste-to-char technology in tackling the challenges associated with industrial wastewater, municipal wastewater, and agricultural wastewater treatment. The outcomes indicated that the char from plastic waste successfully eliminated 80 % of arsenic (+5) at a concentration of 6 g/L for 27 min. The data revealed that plastic char exhibited a variable adsorption capability for As5+, ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 mg/gm.
