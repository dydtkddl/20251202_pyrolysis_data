A review on green adsorbent from plastic waste-derived char for wastewater treatment: Production, aqueous contaminants adsorption, and applications Background Plastics, ubiquitous in municipal solid waste globally, consistently negatively influence the environment. Therefore, it is imperative to recycle them conscientiously. Through the application of thermal pyrolysis, plastics can be transformed into biochar, exemplifying a sustainable and innovative approach to waste management. Methods The primary goal of this work was to thoroughly review the literature on fast pyrolysis of plastic waste, focusing on char formation and its potential applications in wastewater treatment. The analysis found that fast pyrolysis technologies play a crucial role in this complex process. An exact evaluation study was performed to examine the unique features shown by various polymers following their thermochemical conversion into char. Significant findings This study provides the first thorough assessment, highlighting the promising prospects of plastic waste-to-char technology in tackling the challenges associated with industrial wastewater, municipal wastewater, and agricultural wastewater treatment. The outcomes indicated that the char from plastic waste successfully eliminated 80 % of arsenic (+5) at a concentration of 6 g/L for 27 min. The data revealed that plastic char exhibited a variable adsorption capability for As5+, ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 mg/gm.
