You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular characterization of wildfire impacts on organic matter in eroded sediments and topsoil in Mediterranean eucalypt stands Wildfires can increase soil erosion due to the destruction of the vegetation and changes in soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and quality. This fact is especially dramatic in the case of Mediterranean ecosystems. Therefore, the major goal of the present study was to achieve a better understanding of the short-term effects of wildfires on the quantity and quality of organic matter (OM) in the topsoil of burnt Mediterranean eucalyptus plantations in north-central Portugal. Wildfire had a large impact on slope-scale sediment losses, as they were approximately 30 times higher at the burnt site than at the unburnt site over the first 25months after the fire. The pH and total nitrogen (TN) content of the burnt topsoil showed a noticeable increase immediately after the wildfire, whereas the total organic carbon (TOC) content revealed the opposite behavior. However, the TOC content showed a partial recovery during the subsequent two years after the fire. The sediments eroded after the fire were consistently more acidic and richer in TOC and TN than the burnt topsoil; they also revealed less pronounced changes with time-since-fire compared with the burnt topsoil. Analytical pyrolysis analyses indicated that the fire resulted in an enrichment of aromatic compounds, nitrogen (N) constituents, lignin-derived compounds and polysaccharides. The latter is best explained with the input of partially charred OM, ash and decaying parts of plants killed by the fire. The thermal transformation of SOM caused the thermal breakdown and cracking of n-alkane compounds, as was revealed by the increase of the ratio of short-to-long chains and the alteration of the typical odd-over-even carbon predominance indexes. The relative abundance of specific biomarkers for vegetation and, in particular for Eucalyptus globulus, such as terpenoids eucalyptol and globulol decreased drastically or even disappeared from the pyrolysates of the burnt topsoil. These fire-induced changes in the quality of topsoil OM persisted during the whole post-fire period of 25months. In general, the Py–GC/MS results pointed out that during the first two years after the fire the recovery of the topsoil OM quality was practically negligible.
