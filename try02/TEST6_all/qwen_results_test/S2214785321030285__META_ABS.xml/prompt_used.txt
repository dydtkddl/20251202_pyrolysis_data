You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design and development of single screw conveying machine for pyrolysis of waste plastics using nano zeolite particles in fixed bed reactor In the present economic growth, the energy produced from sustainable resources plays a vital role rather than from non-renewable energy resources. There are many alternative sustainable energy resources available for energy development, such as biomass, hydropower, and wind energy. Another interest in current research is the conversion of waste plastic material into liquefied fuel. The use of plastic materials implies high demand and causes depletion of natural resources. Moreover, tons of used plastic materials are ending up in the oceans, landfill or open burning causes pollution. So, a suitable waste management strategy implies controlling or reduce the pollution causing the environment. In this present work, a new method has been addressed to extract liquefied fuels from waste LDPE plastics. A single screw conveying machine setup is fabricated to mix the shredded waste plastics with Nano zeolite catalyst. The various weight percentage of plastic material and zeolite catalyst is mixed and subject to pyrolysis process. The distribution of nano zeolite catalyst with the plastic wastes was found to be even, which leads to improved heat transfer rate, pyrolysis temperature, and reduced reaction time also produces a higher pyrolytic oil yield of 7%. The FT-IR results of extracted pyrolytic oil outcomes showed clear peaks of carbon and oxidizing agent chemical bonds in all liquid oil samples also alkanes present in the oil are confirmed with the GC–MS results. The liquid oil has a higher heating value range of 9820–9860 Kcal/kg, which is close to the standard diesel fuel heating value.
