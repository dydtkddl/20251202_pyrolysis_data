Design and development of single screw conveying machine for pyrolysis of waste plastics using nano zeolite particles in fixed bed reactor In the present economic growth, the energy produced from sustainable resources plays a vital role rather than from non-renewable energy resources. There are many alternative sustainable energy resources available for energy development, such as biomass, hydropower, and wind energy. Another interest in current research is the conversion of waste plastic material into liquefied fuel. The use of plastic materials implies high demand and causes depletion of natural resources. Moreover, tons of used plastic materials are ending up in the oceans, landfill or open burning causes pollution. So, a suitable waste management strategy implies controlling or reduce the pollution causing the environment. In this present work, a new method has been addressed to extract liquefied fuels from waste LDPE plastics. A single screw conveying machine setup is fabricated to mix the shredded waste plastics with Nano zeolite catalyst. The various weight percentage of plastic material and zeolite catalyst is mixed and subject to pyrolysis process. The distribution of nano zeolite catalyst with the plastic wastes was found to be even, which leads to improved heat transfer rate, pyrolysis temperature, and reduced reaction time also produces a higher pyrolytic oil yield of 7%. The FT-IR results of extracted pyrolytic oil outcomes showed clear peaks of carbon and oxidizing agent chemical bonds in all liquid oil samples also alkanes present in the oil are confirmed with the GC–MS results. The liquid oil has a higher heating value range of 9820–9860 Kcal/kg, which is close to the standard diesel fuel heating value.
