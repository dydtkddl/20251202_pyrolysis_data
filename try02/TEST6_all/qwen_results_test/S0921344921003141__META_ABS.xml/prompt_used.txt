You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery and reuse of carbon fibre and acrylic resin from thermoplastic composites used in marine application The development of new sustainable routes towards better environmental footprint of composites for marine boatbuilding is motivated by the absence of eco-friendly and economically viable recycling techniques to deal with growing end-of-life thermoset boats waste and increasing restrictive legislation. Thermoplastic composites may offer the possibility to recover raw materials from retired parts, which could have a substantial environmental and economic benefit. This study investigates the feasibility of recovery and reuse of both reinforcement and matrix from a carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic Elium composite. An original pyrolysis process allowed the depolymerisation of the acrylic matrix and recovery of clean carbon fibres and matrix monomer. Distillation was used to purify the monomer from impurities and a recycled Elium resin was synthesized and reused as matrix with long and aligned recycled carbon fibre reinforcement. The study of the morphological and composition differences at fibre scale resulted in concluding that sizing has been decomposed during depolymerisation process and only small traces of polymer were left on fibre surface. Virgin and recycled resin reinforced with carbon fibre laminates were produced by resin infusion. While tensile modulus, strength and strain at break were nearly unchanged, interlaminar shear strength results showed enhanced fibre-matrix interphase bonding. Dynamic mechanical analysis confirmed the good quality of recovered carbon fibres as well as similar virgin and re-polymerised resin properties. The new composite made from both recycled fibre and matrix could be used in the same application field.
