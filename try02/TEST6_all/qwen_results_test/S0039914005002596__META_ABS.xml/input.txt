Applications of evolved gas analysis Part 1: EGA by infrared spectroscopy The analytical applications of the evolved gas analysis (EGA) performed by infrared spectroscopy, for the period extending from 2001 to 2004, are collected in this review. By this technique, the nature of volatile products released by a substance subjected to a controlled temperature program are on-line determined, with the possibility to prove a supposed reaction, either under isothermal or under heating conditions.
