Synthesis of nanocrystalline cellulose induced hierarchical porous ZSM-5 for catalytic conversion of low-density polyethylene The catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene over hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite was studied to improve liquid oil quality in a facile reactor for the first time. The HZZ was successfully synthesized by using green and inexpensive nanocrystalline cellulose as a mesoporous template. Nanocrystalline cellulose played a disturbing role in the crystallization process of hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite, which facilitated the formation of ordered surface morphology and excellent porous structure. Compared with conventional HZSM-5, hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly improve the bio-oil yield. The relative content of cycloalkanes increased while the relative content of aromatics decreased. The 94.4 area.% of jet fuel range hydrocarbons with 51.8 area.% cycloalkanes and 25.0 area.% of aromatics can be obtained. Hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite with a low Si/Al ratio had high acidity favors high liquid yield and aromatic hydrocarbon selectivity. The current work contributes to the green synthesis of Hierarchical HZSM-5 zeolite while providing a novel catalyst for value-added fuels production from waste plastics pyrolysis.
