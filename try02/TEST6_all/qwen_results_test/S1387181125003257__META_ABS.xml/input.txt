Ni-modified multilayer MFI nanosheets for co-pyrolysis of corn stover and polyethylene to prepare hydrocarbon-rich products Multilayer MFI nanosheets (MMN) with different Ni loading ratios (3, 6, 10 wt%) were synthesized to prepare hydrocarbon-rich products. In view of the thermogravimetric analysis, A mixture of corn stover (CS) and polyethylene (PE) in a ratio of 3:2 exhibits a pronounced synergistic effect. The effects of different doses of MMN and different nickel loadings on pyrolysis products were studied using Py-GC/MS. Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) began to be detected and reached a maximum value of 30.08 % at CP2M, while oxygen-containing compounds (OCCs) decreased by 43.75 % compared to CPNC. The deoxygenation ability of MMNs was further enhanced with different Ni loading ratios, with MMNs having a low Ni loading ratio (3 wt%) achieving the minimum relative content of OCCs at 3.67 %. The introduction of Ni species altered the B/L ratio of MMN, thereby inhibiting the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This work provided a new pathway for preparing hydrocarbon-rich fuels from biomass pyrolysis by using metal-modified MMN.
