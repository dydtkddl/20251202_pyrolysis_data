You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ni-modified multilayer MFI nanosheets for co-pyrolysis of corn stover and polyethylene to prepare hydrocarbon-rich products Multilayer MFI nanosheets (MMN) with different Ni loading ratios (3, 6, 10 wt%) were synthesized to prepare hydrocarbon-rich products. In view of the thermogravimetric analysis, A mixture of corn stover (CS) and polyethylene (PE) in a ratio of 3:2 exhibits a pronounced synergistic effect. The effects of different doses of MMN and different nickel loadings on pyrolysis products were studied using Py-GC/MS. Monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) began to be detected and reached a maximum value of 30.08 % at CP2M, while oxygen-containing compounds (OCCs) decreased by 43.75 % compared to CPNC. The deoxygenation ability of MMNs was further enhanced with different Ni loading ratios, with MMNs having a low Ni loading ratio (3 wt%) achieving the minimum relative content of OCCs at 3.67 %. The introduction of Ni species altered the B/L ratio of MMN, thereby inhibiting the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This work provided a new pathway for preparing hydrocarbon-rich fuels from biomass pyrolysis by using metal-modified MMN.
