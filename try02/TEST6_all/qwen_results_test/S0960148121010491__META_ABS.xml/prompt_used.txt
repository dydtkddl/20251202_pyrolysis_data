You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of renewable carbon resources from the household kitchen waste via char induced microwave pyrolysis This study is focused on creating value addition to kitchen waste (KW) by converting it into valuable product resources via microwave pyrolysis. The effect of the following on product yields and energy efficiency were examined in this study: (i) microwave power (140–700 W), (ii) KW: susceptor ratio (20:0 to 20:20 (g/g)), and (iii) pyrolysis temperature (200–600 °C). The KW was pyrolyzed without the addition of a susceptor and char formed during pyrolysis acted as a susceptor and enhanced pyrolysis energy efficiency (78%). An increase in microwave power has significantly increased the heating rate from 4 to 85 °C/min, and KW has produced 73 wt% of bio-oil and gases even at low microwave power (140 W). An increase in pyrolysis temperature promoted thermal cracking of KW, which resulted in decreased char yields (64–27 wt%), and an increase in gas yields (12–45 wt%). Bio-oil contains a significant amount of phenolics (35–50%) and its selectivity varied significantly with the variables probed. The selectivity of furan derivatives has dramatically decreased from 45 to 20% with the increase in pyrolysis temperature. This work demonstrated the feasibility of valorization of kitchen waste into various value-added products.
