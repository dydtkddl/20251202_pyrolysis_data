Modeling and tracing of polycarbonate (PC) degradation in soil microcosm with a PC microplastics quantification method based on pyrolysis GC–MS Understanding the migration and transformation of polycarbonate (PC) plastic wastes in the natural environment is crucial for assessing their environmental impact and bioremediation. In this study, PC plastic degradation was modeled and traced in soil microcosm by investigating physiochemical properties changes of PC, the formation of microplastics, and changes in soil microbial communities. Notably, PC microplastics quantification method was also successfully devised by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry and also applied herein. Through gel permeation chromatography analysis, the molecular weight of the naturally aged PC film obviously reduced, whereas no change for unaged ones. After 12 months of soil burial, the surface corrosion and holes formation were emerged on the surfaces of both PC films in the non-sterilized soil harboring indigenous microorganisms by scanning electron microscope. The worsened thermal stability of both PC films in non-sterilized soil was demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis. Meanwhile, the presence of increased hydroxyl group absorption and decreased carbonyl peak highlighted molecular chain breakage in both PC films by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In particular, all the changes were more significant in aged PC than unaged ones. Furthermore, the increase of quantified PC microplastics on the surface of PC film in the non-sterilized soil accompanied the decreasing of microbial diversity and the enrichment of potential functional microorganisms. These findings revealed that the combination of natural aging and indigenous microbes exhibited a noticeable performance in PC plastics degradation in soil microcosm, providing new insights into the degradation mechanism of PC plastic wastes in the natural environment.
