You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coal gangue-supported catalyst for the efficient conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes From an economic and environmental perspective, pyrolysis-catalysis is a promising method for converting waste plastics into high-value products. Low-cost catalysts are crucial for the large-scale processing of waste plastics. This study prepared a nickel-based catalyst supported on solid waste coal gangue (CG) using a simple impregnation method and investigated the effect of catalyst composition on the catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene to produce hydrogen and high-value carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Experiments were conducted in a two-stage fixed bed reactor, where the plastic was pyrolyzed in the first stage (500 °C) and the resulting volatiles were activated on the catalyst in the second stage. The effects of catalytic temperature (700–900 °C) and Ni loading (5%–20%) on the products were studied. The results showed that the 15% Ni/CG catalyst exhibited optimal activity at a catalytic temperature of 750 °C, with maximum hydrogen concentration and yield reaching 66.48 vol% and 31.48 mmol/g, respectively, and CNTs yield reaching 79.71 mg g⁻1. At this temperature, the resulting carbon had a high degree of graphitization and fewer defects, with an ID/IG value of 0.72. Additionally, the gas-phase oxidation method effectively regenerates the coal gangue-based catalyst. After five cycles of pyrolysis-catalysis experiments, the hydrogen concentration and yield remained high, at approximately 63.0 vol% and 27 mmol g⁻1. Low-temperature oxidation removed most amorphous carbon, enriching the catalyst surface with up to 73.9 wt% CNTs of high quality (ID/IG ratio of 0.67). The mechanism of CNTs formation from polyethylene pyrolysis and catalytic decomposition was also discussed.
