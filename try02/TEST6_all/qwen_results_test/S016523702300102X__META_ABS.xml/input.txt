RETRACTED: Effect of process parameters on bio-oil yield from lignocellulosic biomass through microwave-assisted pyrolysis technology for sustainable energy resources: Current status This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article is being retracted at the request of the Editors. The authors have plagiarized part of a paper that had already appeared in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 104 (2019) 328-336 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2019.01.030. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that their work is original and has not appeared in a publication elsewhere. Re-use of any data should be appropriately cited. As such, this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter, and apologies are offered to journal readers that this was not detected during the submission process.
