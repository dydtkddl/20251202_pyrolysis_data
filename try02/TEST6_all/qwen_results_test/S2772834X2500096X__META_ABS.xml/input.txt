Advances in Nano-phases Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites: Interfacial Engineering and Configuration Strategy Advances in aerospace technology have fueled a substantial demand for titanium matrix composites (TMCs), as promising candidates for structural load-bearing components. Traditional TMCs, however, encounter the persistent trade-off between strength and ductility due to strong stress concentration induced by micron-phases. Substituting micron-phases with nano-phases (e.g., ceramic nano-phases or carbon nanomaterials) has been demonstrated to effectively improve mechanical properties in TMCs. Nevertheless, severe interfacial lattice mismatch between nano-phases and Ti matrix, coupled with the agglomeration behavior caused by inherent Van der Waals forces of nano-phases pose notable challenges to attaining optimal strengthening efficiency. Thus, this review systematically summarizes recent advancements in addressing the aforementioned dilemma in nano-phases reinforced TMCs (NRTMCs). It begins with an overview of various nano-phases and fabrication methodologies employed in NRTMCs. Subsequently, the discussion focuses on the multiscale design strategies of NRTMCs, encompassing interfacial engineering in nanoscale, and configuration strategies in microscale, mechanical properties and associated strengthening mechanisms in NRTMCs. Finally, this review provides comprehensive insights into current development trends and future application prospects, outlining the advantages/disadvantages alongside underlying issues of NRTMCs. It serves as a valuable guideline for researchers pursuing the next-generation of high-performance TMCs, highlighting the considerable potential of NRTMCs to revolutionize aerospace and other industries.
