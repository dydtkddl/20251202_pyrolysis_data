You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in Nano-phases Reinforced Titanium Matrix Composites: Interfacial Engineering and Configuration Strategy Advances in aerospace technology have fueled a substantial demand for titanium matrix composites (TMCs), as promising candidates for structural load-bearing components. Traditional TMCs, however, encounter the persistent trade-off between strength and ductility due to strong stress concentration induced by micron-phases. Substituting micron-phases with nano-phases (e.g., ceramic nano-phases or carbon nanomaterials) has been demonstrated to effectively improve mechanical properties in TMCs. Nevertheless, severe interfacial lattice mismatch between nano-phases and Ti matrix, coupled with the agglomeration behavior caused by inherent Van der Waals forces of nano-phases pose notable challenges to attaining optimal strengthening efficiency. Thus, this review systematically summarizes recent advancements in addressing the aforementioned dilemma in nano-phases reinforced TMCs (NRTMCs). It begins with an overview of various nano-phases and fabrication methodologies employed in NRTMCs. Subsequently, the discussion focuses on the multiscale design strategies of NRTMCs, encompassing interfacial engineering in nanoscale, and configuration strategies in microscale, mechanical properties and associated strengthening mechanisms in NRTMCs. Finally, this review provides comprehensive insights into current development trends and future application prospects, outlining the advantages/disadvantages alongside underlying issues of NRTMCs. It serves as a valuable guideline for researchers pursuing the next-generation of high-performance TMCs, highlighting the considerable potential of NRTMCs to revolutionize aerospace and other industries.
