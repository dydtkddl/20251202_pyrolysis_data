You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A Comprehensive Review on CNTs and CNT-Reinforced Composites: Syntheses, Characteristics and Applications Since their first synthesis, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) gained remarkable research interest owing to their astonishing mechanical properties and extensive range of potential applications in various sectors, such as aerospace, automobile, biomedical, defence, energy, etc. This paper covers numerous characterization techniques, synthesis approaches and properties of the CNTs, reported by earlier researchers in the past. The technological and industrial needs for the development of lightweight nanocomposites have led to the significant advancements in the preparation of CNT-reinforced composites. In preliminary sections, the properties and applications of the CNT-reinforced nanocomposites are elaborated along with the issues related to their preparation. Here, various nanotubes synthesis processes, such as arc discharge, laser ablation and chemical vapour deposition, are exemplified with the support of published works. Furthermore, we have also addressed the several surface modification techniques of CNTs, such as purification, functionalization and dispersion, which make this review novel and exhaustive. In order to address the limitations and challenges incurred during the preparation of various CNT-reinforced polymer/metal matrix composites, an extensive collection of the published literature is reported and discussed, thoroughly. Based on this exhaustive review, some specific observations are made which would facilitate upcoming researches to explore the research opportunities in the preparation of CNTs and CNT-reinforced composites and their potential applications for the high-performance structures/components.
