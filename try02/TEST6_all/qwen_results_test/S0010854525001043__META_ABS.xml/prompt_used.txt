You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation strategies of waste-derived MOF and their applications in water remediation: A systematic review The severity of aquatic environmental problems has been acknowledged widely. To mitigate the escalating water pollution, it is imperative to adopt appropriate functional environmental materials for water purification. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a favorable option because of their porous and stable characteristics. Conventional MOF preparation relies on the integration of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands. However, the increasing demand for MOF materials emphasizes the need for sustainable and eco-friendly production methods. Utilizing waste resources such as metals and organic contaminants as precursors for hydrolysis/purification facilitates waste reuse and enables the production of waste-derived MOFs (W-MOFs). These W-MOFs can be used extensively in wastewater purification. Given the adsorption and advanced oxidation mechanisms, the selection and preparation of suitable W-MOFs for eliminating diverse pollutants in aquatic environments hold significant potential. The pollutant-removal mechanisms of these high-value W-MOFs should be studied further. In this review, available information regarding the production processes of W-MOF and their physicochemical characterization is discussed. Additionally, the current status of W-MOF applications in wastewater treatment and the underlying purification mechanisms are analyzed. The overarching goal is to provide alternative material preparation methods that promote a green environment and align these with the concept of sustainable waste utilization.
