Preparation strategies of waste-derived MOF and their applications in water remediation: A systematic review The severity of aquatic environmental problems has been acknowledged widely. To mitigate the escalating water pollution, it is imperative to adopt appropriate functional environmental materials for water purification. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a favorable option because of their porous and stable characteristics. Conventional MOF preparation relies on the integration of metal ions/clusters and organic ligands. However, the increasing demand for MOF materials emphasizes the need for sustainable and eco-friendly production methods. Utilizing waste resources such as metals and organic contaminants as precursors for hydrolysis/purification facilitates waste reuse and enables the production of waste-derived MOFs (W-MOFs). These W-MOFs can be used extensively in wastewater purification. Given the adsorption and advanced oxidation mechanisms, the selection and preparation of suitable W-MOFs for eliminating diverse pollutants in aquatic environments hold significant potential. The pollutant-removal mechanisms of these high-value W-MOFs should be studied further. In this review, available information regarding the production processes of W-MOF and their physicochemical characterization is discussed. Additionally, the current status of W-MOF applications in wastewater treatment and the underlying purification mechanisms are analyzed. The overarching goal is to provide alternative material preparation methods that promote a green environment and align these with the concept of sustainable waste utilization.
