Deposition of nanocrystalline CuS thin film from a single precursor: Structural, optical and electrical properties Nanocrystalline CuS thin films were fabricated using a metal organic deposition technique taking Cu(SOCCH3)2Lut2 as the precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Raman spectroscopic techniques were applied for characterization and found that the deposited CuS films were of ‘covellite’ phase with an average particle size of 18nm. Optical measurements showed significant amount of “blue shift” in the band gap energy. Hall measurements of the films showed p-type conduction nature with a carrier concentration in the range 1012–1013 cm−3.
