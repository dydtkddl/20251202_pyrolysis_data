Enhanced decomposition of epoxy resin polymer through steam-assisted pyrolysis: Insights from experiments and ReaxFF-MD simulations The management of waste epoxy resin-based composites has become a worldwide challenge due to the stable crosslinked structure of cured epoxy resin, and pyrolysis is an efficient method to break down this polymer, but the lack of free radicals suppresses its complete decomposition. This study investigated the degradation performance of cured epoxy resin polymer under steam-assisted pyrolysis. The results confirmed that steam substantially enhanced the degradation of epoxy resin, leading to the production of more valuable gases (e.g., H2 and CO) and less pyrolysis char. Moreover, the pyrolysis char generated in a steam atmosphere contained abundant oxygen-containing groups, which resulted in a lower degree of graphitization and higher oxidative reactivity, facilitating its removal through oxidation. Reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations revealed that H and O radicals generated from H2O molecules respectively promoted the cleavage of C–O and C–N bonds within the thermosetting epoxy resin polymer, accelerating its breakdown into phenolic compounds and light hydrocarbons. This research highlighted steam-assisted pyrolysis as a promising method for disposing of epoxy resin-based composites while simultaneously recovering light pyrolysis oil or hydrogen-containing syngas.
