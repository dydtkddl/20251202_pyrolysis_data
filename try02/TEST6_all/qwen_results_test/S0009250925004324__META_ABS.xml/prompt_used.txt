You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced decomposition of epoxy resin polymer through steam-assisted pyrolysis: Insights from experiments and ReaxFF-MD simulations The management of waste epoxy resin-based composites has become a worldwide challenge due to the stable crosslinked structure of cured epoxy resin, and pyrolysis is an efficient method to break down this polymer, but the lack of free radicals suppresses its complete decomposition. This study investigated the degradation performance of cured epoxy resin polymer under steam-assisted pyrolysis. The results confirmed that steam substantially enhanced the degradation of epoxy resin, leading to the production of more valuable gases (e.g., H2 and CO) and less pyrolysis char. Moreover, the pyrolysis char generated in a steam atmosphere contained abundant oxygen-containing groups, which resulted in a lower degree of graphitization and higher oxidative reactivity, facilitating its removal through oxidation. Reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations revealed that H and O radicals generated from H2O molecules respectively promoted the cleavage of C–O and C–N bonds within the thermosetting epoxy resin polymer, accelerating its breakdown into phenolic compounds and light hydrocarbons. This research highlighted steam-assisted pyrolysis as a promising method for disposing of epoxy resin-based composites while simultaneously recovering light pyrolysis oil or hydrogen-containing syngas.
