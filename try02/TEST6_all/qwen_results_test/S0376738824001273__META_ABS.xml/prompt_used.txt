You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon molecular sieve gas separation materials and membranes: A comprehensive review Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes offer some of the best combinations of high selectivity and permeability for molecular separations of permanent and condensable gases available to date. In addition, the fabrication of CMS membranes benefits from the well-established solution processing methods developed for fabrication of high-performance commercial polymeric membranes. In this review, we critically evaluate the extensive data set on CMS membranes available in the peer-reviewed literature published since the 1980s. In the first part, we focus on the material perspectives and evaluate how various polymer chemistries were used as precursors for generation of CMS films. We highlight the role of fluorinated and non-fluorinated polyimides as well as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) which tend to dominate the more recent literature. In addition, we identify the most important parameters that determine the gas separation performance of CMS membranes, such as (i) pyrolysis temperature, (ii) pyrolysis atmosphere, or (iii) pre- and post-treatments and others. We collected and evaluated the CMS membrane performance for the separation of permanent gases (He, H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO2) and highly energy-intensive olefin/paraffin separation. In the second part, we highlight the currently available data on CMS thin-film composite and integrally-skinned asymmetric membranes, which exhibit excellent permeance and selectivity in many important industrial separations. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations for future research in the area of CMS materials and membranes based on a critical evaluation of the reported data.
