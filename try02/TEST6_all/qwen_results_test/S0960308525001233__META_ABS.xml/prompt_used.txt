You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of orange peels through the production of eco-friendly, highly effective adsorbents for herbicides based on one-step CO₂-activation under conventional/microwave heating Orange peels were used to produce new eco-friendly activated carbons with high adsorption performance towards diuron and glyphosate, even in aqueous systems with complex composition. Activated carbons were obtained through a one-step process involving biomass pyrolysis and CO2-consuming physical activation under conventional or microwave-assisted heating. Surprisingly, despite worse textural parameters, materials produced in a conventional manner showed a higher ability to immobilize herbicides of different nature than analogous solids obtained in a microwave furnace. With the initial diuron concentration of 10 mg/L, 97 % (48.68 mg/g) and 73 % (35.57 mg/g) of the herbicide were adsorbed on the materials produced through conventional and microwave heating, respectively. In the case of glyphosate, the adsorption efficiency was 58 % (2.91 mg/g) for the carbonaceous material obtained in a conventional furnace and 25 % (1.26 mg/g) for that treated with microwaves. The adsorption of diuron and glyphosate was also studied in complex systems containing metals (Cu, Cd), metalloids (As, Se) or polymers (synthetic cationic and anionic polyacrylamide, bacterial exopolysaccharide). It was noted that cationic polyacrylamide favored glyphosate binding, but its impact on the herbicide adsorption was rather small. The desorption degree of diuron from the produced materials was rather at low level (4.36 % in total after 3 desorption cycles conducted with water), but the addition of polymers further decreased this value. Cationic polyacrylamide significantly decreased the total desorption of glyphosate, i.e., from 40 % to even 0 %. The activated carbon of the highest adsorption capacity appeared to be non-phytotoxic and able to enhance plant growth in the glyphosate presence.
