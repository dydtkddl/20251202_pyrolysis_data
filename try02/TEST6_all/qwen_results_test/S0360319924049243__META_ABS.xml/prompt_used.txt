You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced syngas production via plastic rubber chemical looping gasification: Role of iron–nickel oxide oxygen carriers To meet the growing demand for efficient waste management solutions, a novel method called Plastic Rubber Chemical Loop Gasification (PRCLG) offers an innovative and effective approach to the thermal treatment of rubber and plastic waste, producing high-purity fuel and hydrogen-rich syngas. In this study, iron-nickel oxide was synthesized and used as an oxygen carrier to facilitate the PRCLG process. The impact of these oxygen carriers on syngas production was thoroughly investigated, and the evolution of the oxygen carrier's activity was analyzed through changes in the microenvironment during the gasification process. Experimental results showed that under pyrolysis conditions at 750 °C, the syngas yield was 1142 mL/g. After introducing a controlled atmosphere with 1.5 mL/h of water vapor, the syngas yield increased to 2150 mL/g. Further enhancement of the syngas yield using a catalyst resulted in a yield of 3562 mL/g, with a carbon conversion rate of 94%. The study confirmed that optimal syngas yields were achieved at 750 °C, highlighting the importance of precise temperature control. Over ten cycles spanning 600 min, the iron-nickel oxide oxygen carrier exhibited stable performance, demonstrating its durability and effectiveness. This innovative PRCLG method not only provides a solution for the disposal of rubber and plastic waste but also contributes to the production of valuable energy resources, aligning with sustainable development goals and advancing waste-to-energy technologies.
