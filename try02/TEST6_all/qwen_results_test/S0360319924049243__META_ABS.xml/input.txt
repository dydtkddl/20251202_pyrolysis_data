Enhanced syngas production via plastic rubber chemical looping gasification: Role of iron–nickel oxide oxygen carriers To meet the growing demand for efficient waste management solutions, a novel method called Plastic Rubber Chemical Loop Gasification (PRCLG) offers an innovative and effective approach to the thermal treatment of rubber and plastic waste, producing high-purity fuel and hydrogen-rich syngas. In this study, iron-nickel oxide was synthesized and used as an oxygen carrier to facilitate the PRCLG process. The impact of these oxygen carriers on syngas production was thoroughly investigated, and the evolution of the oxygen carrier's activity was analyzed through changes in the microenvironment during the gasification process. Experimental results showed that under pyrolysis conditions at 750 °C, the syngas yield was 1142 mL/g. After introducing a controlled atmosphere with 1.5 mL/h of water vapor, the syngas yield increased to 2150 mL/g. Further enhancement of the syngas yield using a catalyst resulted in a yield of 3562 mL/g, with a carbon conversion rate of 94%. The study confirmed that optimal syngas yields were achieved at 750 °C, highlighting the importance of precise temperature control. Over ten cycles spanning 600 min, the iron-nickel oxide oxygen carrier exhibited stable performance, demonstrating its durability and effectiveness. This innovative PRCLG method not only provides a solution for the disposal of rubber and plastic waste but also contributes to the production of valuable energy resources, aligning with sustainable development goals and advancing waste-to-energy technologies.
