You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transformation characteristics of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine during microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment of excavated waste The removal effect of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine from the excavated waste utilizing the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was investigated in this work. Speciation changes of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in hydrochars with different treatment times were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Results showed that 90% chlorine, 65% nitrogen and 63% sulfur were removed from the excavated waste after treatment at 230 °C for 100 min, while 82% energy and 85% carbon element were recovered at the same time. The conversion of organic nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine into the corresponding water-soluble inorganic forms was enhanced by the combined microwave irradiation and hydrothermal reaction, which promoted the migration of Cl, S, N into the liquid phase. However, some original and generated species of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine remained in the hydrochars due to the polymerization of organic forms and the adsorption of inorganic forms. These findings suggested that the efficient purification of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in excavated waste could be obtained using the microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment without additives, which provided a reference for the recycling and cleaning utilization of excavated waste.
