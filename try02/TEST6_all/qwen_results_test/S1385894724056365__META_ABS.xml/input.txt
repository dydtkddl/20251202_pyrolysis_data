Integration of photo/magnetic responsive composite phase change materials with polyurethane sponge for sustainable and efficient cleanup of crude oil spills The efficient remediation of viscous oil spills is still a global challenge in practice due to the poor fluidity caused by their high viscosity. The adsorbents with in situ heating characteristics are regard as potential candidate for rapid and efficient crude oil spills cleanup. Although solar-assisted heating is the cleanest and most energy-efficient way, the great variation of sunlight intensity with the season and location is an obstacle to its practical application. To promote oil adsorption and enhance energy utilization efficiency, we constructed a novel adsorbent with simultaneous photo/magnetic-thermal response, and importantly phase change materials (PCMs) as thermal energy storage unit were introduced into the adsorbents. The Co/CNTs with high graphitization as efficient sunlight absorbers can significantly improve the photothermal conversion capacity of the adsorbent, resulting in rapid oil adsorption under solar illumination. Besides, benefiting from the superior magnetic response of Co particles encapsulated in the carbon skeleton, the adsorbent also enables efficient oil adsorption under alternating magnetic field. Most importantly, thanks to the cross-connected network structure of CNTs derived from the carbonization of ZIF-67, the PEG was well anchored in the Co/CNTs particles, which allows the adsorbent to store thermal energy and release heat for sustained cleanup of the oil spills when the energy input is insufficient. The adsorbent integrates with superior photo/magnetic-thermal conversion and thermal storage functions provides an innovative solution for efficient and energy-saving remediation of crude oil spills and breaks new grounds of PCMs applications.
