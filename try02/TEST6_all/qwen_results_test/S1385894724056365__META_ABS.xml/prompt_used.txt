You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integration of photo/magnetic responsive composite phase change materials with polyurethane sponge for sustainable and efficient cleanup of crude oil spills The efficient remediation of viscous oil spills is still a global challenge in practice due to the poor fluidity caused by their high viscosity. The adsorbents with in situ heating characteristics are regard as potential candidate for rapid and efficient crude oil spills cleanup. Although solar-assisted heating is the cleanest and most energy-efficient way, the great variation of sunlight intensity with the season and location is an obstacle to its practical application. To promote oil adsorption and enhance energy utilization efficiency, we constructed a novel adsorbent with simultaneous photo/magnetic-thermal response, and importantly phase change materials (PCMs) as thermal energy storage unit were introduced into the adsorbents. The Co/CNTs with high graphitization as efficient sunlight absorbers can significantly improve the photothermal conversion capacity of the adsorbent, resulting in rapid oil adsorption under solar illumination. Besides, benefiting from the superior magnetic response of Co particles encapsulated in the carbon skeleton, the adsorbent also enables efficient oil adsorption under alternating magnetic field. Most importantly, thanks to the cross-connected network structure of CNTs derived from the carbonization of ZIF-67, the PEG was well anchored in the Co/CNTs particles, which allows the adsorbent to store thermal energy and release heat for sustained cleanup of the oil spills when the energy input is insufficient. The adsorbent integrates with superior photo/magnetic-thermal conversion and thermal storage functions provides an innovative solution for efficient and energy-saving remediation of crude oil spills and breaks new grounds of PCMs applications.
