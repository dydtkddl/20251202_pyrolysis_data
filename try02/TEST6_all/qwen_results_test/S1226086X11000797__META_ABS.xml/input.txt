Thermal degradation of plywood with block polypropylene in TG and batch reactor system The copyrolysis of plywood and block polypropylene (PP) was carried out in a batch reactor system, and analyzed via TGA and Py-GC/MS. Specific attention was paid to the diagnosis of the interaction between the plywood and block polypropylene during their copyrolysis, with the relationship between the interaction and improvement in the quality of the bio-oil explained. From the TGA results, the window of the decomposition temperature of PP during copyrolysis was slightly increased, indicating that the products from the pyrolysis of plywood affected the characteristic of the pyrolysis of PP. The new products not observed in the single component pyrolysis were formed and the quantities of products appeared in the single component pyrolysis also varied. In the batch reactor system, the bio-oil yield was increased and the amounts of oxygen and water decreased. Consequently, the heating value of the bio-oil was increased.
