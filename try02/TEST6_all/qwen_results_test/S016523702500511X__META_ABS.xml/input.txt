Comprehensive evaluation of e-waste plastic pyrolysis technology: Research status, technical challenges and prospects With the rapid growth of electronic waste (e-waste), traditional landfill and incineration methods are generally faced with environmental pollution, high energy consumption, low economy or insufficient material stability and other problems. It is difficult to meet the dual needs of efficient resource recycling and sustainable development of e-waste. Pyrolysis technology has become a mainstream solution for recycling electronic plastics due to its efficient resource conversion and pollution control capabilities. In this paper, the reaction mechanism, development status and engineering challenges of vacuum pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, microwave assisted pyrolysis and plasma pyrolysis are systematically reviewed. The efficiency and limitations of these five technologies are analyzed in combination with experimental data and cases. In response to the challenges of efficient conversion and pollution control in the recycling of electronic plastics, this paper proposes a solution centered on the collaborative coupling of multiple technologies, aiming to explore efficient recycling technologies for plastics in e-waste and promote the large-scale application of pyrolysis technology in e-waste. Pyrolysis technology provides a feasible path for high-value conversion of electronic plastics, but its industrialization needs to break through the bottlenecks of material corrosion resistance, catalyst stability and optimization of system energy efficiency. Future research should focus on catalytic system innovation, multi-technology collaboration, intelligent process regulation, whole-chain environmental assessment and industrialization verification, and promote technology from the laboratory to industrialization.
