You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green solvents for end-of-life photovoltaic module recycling: Mechanisms, applications, environmental and economic perspectives The significant rise in photovoltaic (PV) deployment has led to growing concerns over end-of-life (EOL) PV waste, highlighting the need for sustainable recycling technologies. Conventional recycling methods often involve high energy consumption or toxic chemicals. Green solvents have gained considerable attention as promising alternatives. Importantly, green solvents in EOL PV recycling serve two main functions: (i) removing or delaminating polymer encapsulants to separate glass and backsheet, and (ii) leaching valuable metals such as silicon, aluminium, and silver from the solar cells. Despite growing interest, the literature does not yet provide a comprehensive understanding of these applications. This review addresses this gap by examining a range of green solvents such as supercritical fluids, bio-based solvents, water, and deep eutectic solvents in the context of EOL PV recycling. This review found that these solvents offer reduced environmental impact, high separation efficiency of the encapsulation layer, and reusability, with a study reporting solvent reuse up to twenty-four times. Despite these benefits, green solvents face limitations in scalability and cost. Future research should focus on process optimization and the techno-economic feasibility of using these solvents in PV recycling processes.
