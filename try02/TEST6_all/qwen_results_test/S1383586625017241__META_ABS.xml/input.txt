High value-added utilization of CO2: Materials, methods, and prospects for catalytic conversion of graphene prepared from CO2 The rapid rise in global CO2 levels, driven by excessive reliance on fossil fuels, has made global warming, sea-level rise, and energy depletion among the most urgent and critical challenges facing modern society. As a transformative material, graphene holds significant promise for enabling a more sustainable future for fossil fuel-dependent economies. Given the generally low added value of CO2 utilization, this paper outlines the preparation mechanisms and catalytic conditions for synthesizing graphene using CO2 as both a precursor and an end product. It also evaluates the advantages and limitations of various preparation methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the gold thermal reaction, and molten salt carbon capture and electrochemical transformation (MSCCET), alongside the structural properties of graphene. In the high-value-added synthesis of graphene from CO2, advancements in catalyst performance, preparation mechanisms, and morphological control are crucial. Additionally, cost and environmental assessments must not be overlooked. This work provides valuable insights for advancing the high-value-added utilization of CO2 and the development of graphene-based materials.
