You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into glycine pyrolysis mechanisms: Integrated experimental and molecular dynamics/DFT simulation studies Understanding pyrolysis pathways of nitrogen-rich biomass is a key to the pyrolytic production of value-added N-rich biochar and bio-oil or the removal of fuel-N to avoid NOX emission. Laboratory pyrolytic experiments referring to horizontal tube furnace pyrolyzer and several real-time analytic instruments, and numerical simulations involving reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) and density functional theory (DFT) were integrated to explore the pyrolysis of glycine (Gly), which is the simplest amino acid or organic N-carrier in biomass. The major products, reaction pathways, and some theoretical data were obtained and compared with the previous studies to understand the Gly pyrolysis mechanisms. Dehydration of Gly to afford H2O as well as glycylglycine and diketopiperazine (DKP), and decarboxylation of Gly to produce CO2 as well as amines were the dominant reactions at the initial pyrolysis stage, and H free radical transfer was the dominant way to induce these reactions. The pyrolysis of Gly and its derivatives such as glycylglycine and DKP yielded common products such as CO2, NH3, HCN, HNCO, CO, acetic acid, and acetamide; other chemicals including cyclobutanol, propane, alanine, dimethylamine, acetonitrile, and methylamine were also observed, which was different from previous studies. These findings provided a new insight into the pyrolysis mechanisms of Gly, and also showed a great potential of the integrated experiment and simulation on such investigations.
