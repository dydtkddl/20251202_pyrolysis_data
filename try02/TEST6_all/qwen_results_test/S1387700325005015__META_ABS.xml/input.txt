Multifaceted roles of hydroxyapatite: An extensive overview of synthesis approaches and applications in medicine and industry Hydroxyapatite (HA) has been widely used in regenerative medicine since its debut in 1950s. HA is preferred over other apatite family crystals to be used in bioceramics for its unique properties, including high biocompatibility and bioactivity. Its chemical composition and structure closely resemble that of natural bone mineral, allowing it to effectively mimic bone architecture and function as a scaffold. This review focuses on different approaches to synthesize HA, including wet, dry and high-temperature techniques, as well as using cost-effective natural biowastes like eggshells and animal bones. Beyond its established applications in bone transplants and dentistry, HA shows promise in non-medical fields such as catalysis and environmental remediation. HA is also used as a drug delivery carrier in cancer therapy, bolstered by its inherent bactericidal properties. HA derived from natural sources such as fish bones, scales, cow bones, sheep teeth and shells makes it an environment friendly option and a sustainable method to be used in modern biomedical engineering. This paper provides an extensive overview of the synthesis of HA by varying different reaction parameters like pH, temperature and duration of the processes and aims to elucidate how these factors influence the properties of HA. This review also focusses on the prominent applications of HA, highlighting its significance in both medical and industrial fields.
