You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-inspired and biomaterials-based hybrid photocatalysts for environmental detoxification: A review New materials tend to revolutionize scientific community and human race on a larger level. Scientists worldwide have not just been working on some wondrous materials with superior properties but have progressively focused on greener bio-inspired or bio-compatible materials for sustainable development. An increasing number of researchers have been working on using biomaterials as a part of photocatalysts for stability, bio-compatibility, generation of more reactive oxygen species and enhancement of optical absorption. In this review we have focussed on photocatalysts based on biopolymers, biochar, carbons, enzymes and proteins. This review presents various types of bio-inspired nanomaterials and their use as sustainable photocatalysts for degrading various venomous pollutants. The effect of pyrolysis temperature, temperature gradient, feedstock and synthetic route of biochar and carbon on the properties and final performance of derived photocatalysts has also been discussed. The increase in surface area, active adsorption sites, electron shuttling & reservoir properties, high visible absorption, charge separation and biocompatibility have also been elaborated. As far as photocatalytic performance is considered such bio-based photocatalysts are often questioned for their stability under such conditions and poor activity as compared to pure metal-based catalysts. These limitations can be overcome by choice of materials, modifications, new designing routes and coupling of biological methods and photocatalysis for removal of pollutants even from water from waste water treatment plants. Suitable modification to biomolecules as functionalisation has been reported for better adsorption of pollutants. The role of biomaterials in generation of reactive oxygen species, recombination suppression, interactions with pollutants, optical absorption, separation of charge carriers, shuttling and electron flow has also been elaborately explained. The concerns, challenges and future opportunities are also included in this review.
