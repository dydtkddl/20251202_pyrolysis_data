You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Probing PAH formation chemical kinetics from benzene and toluene pyrolysis in a single-pulse shock tube Benzene and toluene were pyrolyzed under highly argon-diluted conditions at a nominal pressure of 20 bar in a single-pulse shock tube coupled to gas chromatography/gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/GC–MS) diagnostics. Concentration evolutions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) intermediates were measured in a temperature range of 1100–1800 K by analyzing the post-shock gas mixtures. Different PAH speciation behaviors, regarding types, concentrations and formation temperature windows, were observed in the two reaction systems. A kinetic model was proposed to predict and interpret the measurements. Through a combination of experimental and modeling efforts, PAH formation patterns from species pools of benzene and toluene pyrolysis were illustrated. In both cases, channels leading to PAHs basically originate from the respective fuel radicals, phenyl and benzyl. Due to the higher thermal stability of benzene, the production of phenyl, and thus most PAH species, occur in higher temperature windows, in comparison to the case of toluene. In benzene pyrolysis, benzyne participates in the formation of crucial PAH species such as naphthalene and acenaphthylene. Phenyl self-recombination takes considerable carbon flux into biphenyl, which serves as an important intermediate leading to acenaphthylene through hydrogen loss and ring closure. The resonantly-stabilized benzyl is abundant in toluene pyrolysis, and its decomposition further produces other resonantly-stabilized radicals such as fulvenallenyl and propargyl. Barrierless addition reactions among these radicals are found to be important sources of PAHs. Fuel-specific pathways have pronounced effects on PAH speciation behaviors, particularly at lower temperatures where fuel depletion is not completed within the reaction time of 4.0 ms. Contributions from the commonly existing Hydrogen-Abstraction-Carbon-Addition (HACA) routes increase with the temperature in both cases.
