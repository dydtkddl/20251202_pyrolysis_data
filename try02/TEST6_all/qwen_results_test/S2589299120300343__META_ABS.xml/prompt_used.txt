You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorisation of oil palm wastes into high yield and energy content biochars via slow pyrolysis: Multivariate process optimisation and combustion kinetic studies Palm kernel shell (PKS) and empty fruit bunch (EFB) are agricultural wastes discharged in significant quantities by the Malaysia palm oil industry. In this work, valorisation of these wastes via slow pyrolysis were experimentally and statistically investigated to synthesise biochars. The interactive effects of several synthesis parameters (nitrogen flowrate, heating rate, pyrolysis temperature and time) on two pyrolysis process responses, viz biochar yield and higher heating value (HHV), were simultaneously assayed. The pyrolysis variables were optimised by response surface methodology (RSM) to maximise the two responses. It was determined that the optimum conditions for the biochars synthesis were 30 mL min−1 flowrate, 18.9–20 °C min−1 heating rate, 500–504.3 °C pyrolysis temperature and 30 min pyrolysis time. Under these synthesis conditions, the biochar yields were 34.27 and 36.86%, and HHV were 26.64 and 28.96 MJ kg−1 for EFB-biochar and PKS-biochar, respectively. The proximate analysis revealed that the biochars exhibited high fixed carbon contents. The current study also demonstrated that the activation energies of the EFB-biochar and PKS-biochar were three times lower than their corresponding raw wastes signifying the importance of the developed biochars as promising feedstock for combustion and gasification applications.
