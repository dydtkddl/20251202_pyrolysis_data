Role of activation progress on textural properties of biochar and their impact on tar cracking The gasification process converts biomass into syngas and produces biochar, a porous solid by-product, potentially with a high surface area, ideal for tar cracking applications. In this study, biochars with varying textural properties were produced by activating them under CO2 and H2O atmospheres to different extents of conversion. The relationship between these properties—particularly surface area and pore size distribution—and the conversion of a model tar was then examined. Results show that while the activation agent (CO2 or H2O), which impacts pore size distribution, had minimal influence on tar conversion, the activation progress, controlling specific surface area, was crucial. At 850 °C, toluene conversion ranged from 35 % for biochar with 300 m2/g surface area to nearly 100 % for biochar with 800 m2/g. Additionally, activation improved gas quality, with higher concentrations of H2, CO, and CH4 correlating with increased biochar surface area.
