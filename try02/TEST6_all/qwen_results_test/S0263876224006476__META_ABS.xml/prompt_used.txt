You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and kinetic study of pressurized CO2 gasification of biomass chars Pressurized CO2 gasification of biomass represents an effective approach for the utilization of biomass and the reduction of CO2 emissions. The impact of CO2 partial pressure on the gasification kinetics of biomass chars was examined on a pressurized thermogravimetric analyzer at temperatures between 750 and 950 °C and elevated pressures (up to 1 MPa). The findings demonstrated that the gasification rates of corn stalk char (CSC), toonasinesis sawdust char (TSC), and rice husk char (RHC) exhibited an increase with rising CO2 partial pressure. The reaction order exhibited variability with respect to CO2 partial pressure, gasification temperature, and biomass type. The reaction order associated with biomass char exhibited a higher value at the elevated CO2 partial pressure range (0.25–1.0 MPa) relative to the low CO2 partial pressure range (0.025–0.1 MPa). The nth-order model was employed to elucidate the gasification behaviors of biomass chars. The results indicated that the modified random pore model was successfully applied to model the gasification of CSC and TSC. The grain model was effective in predicting the gasification behavior of RHC. The gasification rates of the three biomass chars were accurately predicted by the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model at both low and high CO2 partial pressures. This study presents information on the effect of CO2 partial pressure on biomass char gasification and methods for predicting biomass char gasification under pressurized conditions.
