Optimization of the grain boundary network and tensile properties of powder metallurgy-hot isostatic pressed Ni-based alloy Inconel 625 Powder metallurgy-hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIPing) is an advanced manufacturing technology for large-sized and complex-shaped components for nuclear applications. In the present study, a novel PM-HIPing strategy was proposed to optimize the grain boundary network and tensile properties of Ni-based alloy Inconel 625, and it was verified by a series of experiments. Samples with 69 % and 74 % of coincidence site lattice (CSL) grain boundaries were obtained when the narrow-size ranged powder was consolidated at 1140 °C and 1180 °C, respectively. The fraction of CSL grain boundaries was further increased to ∼78.5 % after a high temperature solution treatment. Room temperature yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of PM-HIPed alloy 625 were comparable to that of the wrought specimens, elongation of the specimens was ∼56–60 %, the samples all featured with dimple ductile dominant fracture mode.
