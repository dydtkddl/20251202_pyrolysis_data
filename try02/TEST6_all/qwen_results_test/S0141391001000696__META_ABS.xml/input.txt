Experimental study of polystyrene thermolysis to moderate conversion A general model for polymer degradation by concurrent random and chain-end processes was developed using continuous distribution kinetics. Population balance equations based on fundamental, mechanistic free radical reactions were solved analytically by the moment method. The model, applicable to any molecular weight distribution (MWD), reduces to the cases of independent random or chain-end scission. Polystyrene degradation experiments in mineral oil solution at 275–350°C supported the model and determined reaction rate parameters. The degradation proceeded to moderate extents requiring a MW-dependent random scission rate coefficient. Throughout the experiments, the polymer MWD, which was measured by GPC, maintained the exponential form, so that the logarithm of MWD varies linearly with MW, with slope directly related to the number-average MW. Polystyrene random scission activation energy was 7.0 kcal/mol, which agrees well with other thermolysis investigations but is lower than that found by pyrolysis due to fundamental differences between the processes. Magnesium oxide, added as a heterogeneous catalyst in solution, was found to have no effect on polystyrene degradation rate.
