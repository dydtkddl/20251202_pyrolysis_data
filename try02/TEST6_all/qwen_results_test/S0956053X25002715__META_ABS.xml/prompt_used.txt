You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Computational-fluid-dynamics simulation of nitrogen oxide emission in a vertical-type waste incinerator under oxyfuel- and air-combustion conditions Oxyfuel combustion can significantly enhance carbon capture; however, its effects on NOX emissions are not yet fully understood in municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration. In this study, NOX generation in a vertical-type waste incinerator under air- and oxyfuel-combustion conditions was investigated using a combined experimental and computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) modeling approach. Pyrolysis and combustion experiments were conducted using refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to determine NOX precursors. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to quantify the thermal degradation behavior and determine the kinetic parameters of RDF and char. Gas chromatography analysis identified NH3 and HCN as the dominant NOX precursors, which were subsequently used in modeling NOX formation. The Kilpinen-97 reaction mechanism was implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate NOX formation in a zero-dimensional (0D) waste bed model and a two-dimensional (2D) combustion and recombustion chamber model. The results revealed that oxyfuel combustion significantly reduced NOX emissions by 12% compared to air combustion. This reduction was primarily attributed to the higher CO concentration under oxyfuel conditions, which enhanced NOX reduction through radical-driven reactions. Moreover, the 2D CFD model predicted lower NOX emissions than the 0D model, highlighting the impact of carbon dioxide’s physical properties on the flue gas mixing quality. Overall, these findings emphasize the potential of oxyfuel combustion to reduce NOX emissions and promote carbon capture in waste-to-energy plants, thus presenting a promising pathway toward more sustainable waste management.
