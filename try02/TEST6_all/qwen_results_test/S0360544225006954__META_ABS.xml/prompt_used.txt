You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of CO-rich syngas through CO2-Mediated pyrolysis of plastic waste and its practical use for power generation Pyrolysis of plastic waste has emerged as a strategic measure to produce liquid fuel, expanding applicability in internal combustion engines under controllable equivalence ratio. However, a difficulty in the precise control of hydrocarbon (HC) chain lengths in the liquid fuel still restricts its reliable utilization. To produce more combustible fuel, transforming plastic waste into gaseous fuels may be more viable approach. This study thus investigated a pyrolytic conversion of plastic waste, plastic bag waste (PBW), into syngas while leveraging carbon dioxide (CO2) as a partial oxidative agent. Pyrolysis of PBW generates a broad spectrum of HCs, which are unsuitable as transportation fuel. However, introducing CO2 enabled its interaction with PBW-derived pyrogenic HCs, partially shortening their carbon chain lengths. A nickel (Ni) catalyst was introduced to accelerate the reaction kinetics to govern the functional reactivity of CO2. Peak intensities of pyrogenic HCs were notably reduced, with effective conversion into CO-rich syngas, contributing to the enhanced carbon availability and suppressed CO2 emission within the proposed pyrolysis system. Catalytic pyrolysis was conducted under diverse temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) and CO2 concentrations (0, 20, 50, and 80 vol% CO2) to optimize the mechanistic reactivity of CO2. For a practical evaluation, the resulting CO-rich syngas was simulated in a gas turbine cycle model for power generation. The thermodynamic variables were determined using the syngas compositional matrix and then used to estimate gas turbine performances including work output and thermal efficiency. The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine cycle was significantly enhanced when utilizing CO-rich syngas produced from CO2-mediated catalytic pyrolysis, demonstrating more than two-fold increase compared with commercial natural gas.
