You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Studying the thermo-oxidative stability of chars using pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimetry A method to estimate the thermo-oxidative stability of chars is proposed using pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimetry. The temperature of char degradation is measured for different oxygen fractions (from 0.01 to 0.4, i.e. from 0 to 40%) into the pyrolyzer. Then the thermo-oxidative stability versus the oxygen fraction is modelled using a simple phenomenological equation. Two parameters have been calculated: the first one predicts the temperature of char degradation in “pure” oxygen and the second one corresponds to the sensitivity of the char degradation temperature to the oxygen fraction. These two parameters allow comparing the chars obtained from different materials after various pyrolysis procedures. Rough relationships between these two parameters and the elemental composition of char are identified. Phosphorus allows improving the thermo-oxidative stability of chars as expected but its effect is nonlinear. Lignocellulosic materials lead to chars with low thermal stability even when the phosphorus content is high. Finally, the obtained results show that the char elemental composition is not the only parameter influencing its thermo-oxidative stability.
