A comprehensive review of biomass utilization for sustainable biofuel and biocomponent development Environmental concerns and severe urgency in combating climate change have made the pursuit of sustainable energy sources more critical. Biomass is a renewable energy resource that can be used for a variety of uses, including bioenergy, biochemicals, bioproducts, and waste optimization. It has been recognized that biomass plays an important role in the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon energy future by providing a clean and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the essential elements of biomass and its application in addressing sustainability challenges throughout the value chain, encompassing biomass selection criteria as well as the difficulties encountered in utilizing lignocellulosic materials, agricultural residues, and organic wastes. The article elucidates the principal technologies that provide multifaceted approaches to valorizing biomass, thus enabling the production of biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bioplastics, and bio-based chemicals. The article utilizes environmental sustainability metrics, including Environmental Impact Assessment, resource productivity, circular economy principles, and a techno-economic analysis of biofuels, to achieve net-zero emissions. Moreover, this review helps industrial agents, academia, and policymakers to understand the impact of practicing biomass-based biofuel on solving adverse climate change.
