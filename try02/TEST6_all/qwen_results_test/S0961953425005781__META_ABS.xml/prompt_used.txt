You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of biomass utilization for sustainable biofuel and biocomponent development Environmental concerns and severe urgency in combating climate change have made the pursuit of sustainable energy sources more critical. Biomass is a renewable energy resource that can be used for a variety of uses, including bioenergy, biochemicals, bioproducts, and waste optimization. It has been recognized that biomass plays an important role in the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon energy future by providing a clean and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the essential elements of biomass and its application in addressing sustainability challenges throughout the value chain, encompassing biomass selection criteria as well as the difficulties encountered in utilizing lignocellulosic materials, agricultural residues, and organic wastes. The article elucidates the principal technologies that provide multifaceted approaches to valorizing biomass, thus enabling the production of biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas, bioplastics, and bio-based chemicals. The article utilizes environmental sustainability metrics, including Environmental Impact Assessment, resource productivity, circular economy principles, and a techno-economic analysis of biofuels, to achieve net-zero emissions. Moreover, this review helps industrial agents, academia, and policymakers to understand the impact of practicing biomass-based biofuel on solving adverse climate change.
