You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tuning the electrochemical behaviors of N-doped LiMn x Fe1– x PO4/C via cation engineering with metal-organic framework-templated strategy LiFePO4, as a prevailing cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), still encounters issues such as intrinsic poor electronic conductivity, inferior Li-ion diffusion kinetic, and two-phase transformation mechanism involving substantial structural rearrangements, resulting in unsatisfactory rate performance. Carbon coating, cation doping, and morphological control have been widely employed to reconcile these issues. Inspired by these, we propose a synthetic route with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as self-sacrificial templates to simultaneously realize shape modulation, Mn doping, and N-doped carbon coating for enhanced electrochemical performances. The as-synthesized LiMn x Fe1– x PO4/C (x = 0, 0.25, and 0.5) deliver tunable electrochemical behaviors induced by the MOF templates, among which LiMn0.25Fe0.75PO4/C outperforms its counterparts in cyclability (164.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C) and rate capability (116.3 mA h g−1 at 10 C). Meanwhile, the ex-situ XRD reveals a dominant single-phase solid solution mechanism of LiMn0.25Fe0.75PO4/C during delithiation, contrary to the pristine LiFePO4, without major structural reconstruction, which helps to explain the superior rate performance. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify the effects of Mn doping and embody the superiority of LiMn0.25Fe0.75PO4/C as a LIB cathode, which well supports the experimental observations. This work provides insightful guidance for the design of tunable MOF-derived mixed transition-metal systems for advanced LIBs.
