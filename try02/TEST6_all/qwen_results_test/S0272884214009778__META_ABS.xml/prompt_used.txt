You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Two-step debinding and co-extrusion of ceramic-filled PEBA and EVA blends The objective of this study is to investigate the choice of thermoplastic binders in a two-step debinding process involving solvent extraction (SE) and thermal debinding (TD) of samples produced using polymer (co-)extrusion. Two-step debinding uses a binder system combining soluble binders and thermoplastic binders, which are removed by SE and TD, respectively. In prior work, it was demonstrated that the two-step protocol eliminates debinding defects that are commonly observed in TD (Sharmin and Schoegl, 2014 [1]). The primary goal of this follow-up study is to establish that two-step debinding eliminates debinding defects irrespective of the choice of thermoplastic binders; a secondary goal is to investigate how the binder choice affects the co-extrusion process. In total, five batches using alumina powder and a binder system with a 1:1 ratio of thermoplastic binder and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as water soluble binder were tested. Three grades of polyethylene butyl acrylate (PEBA) and two grades of polyethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) with different melt flow indices were investigated. In all cases, extraction tests resulted in 80wt% removal of the original PEG content. However, PEBA samples showed a significantly faster PEG removal compared to EVA samples, which is attributed to a better dispersion of PEG within EVA. Tests with 4h extracted PEBA and 6h extracted EVA samples resulted in 60wt% removal of PEG and a defect-free specimen after TD and sintering. Also, microstructures of sintered PEBA and EVA samples are comparable, which confirms that the choice of thermoplastic binders has no effect on the two-step debinding process. Co-extrusion tests were performed for selected EVA and PEBA blends, where results showed better performance for co-extrusion of EVA blends.
