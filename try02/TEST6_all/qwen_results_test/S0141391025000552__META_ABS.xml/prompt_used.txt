You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Durability and performance of sustainable composite films from aliphatic-aromatic polyester with biomass-derived carbon-based filler particles Additives are known to improve the properties of biopolymers, but most additives have environmental or performance concerns that limit their use. In this context, the recovery and use of bio-waste and biomass for the formulation of sustainable bio-composites is a challenging issue for the transition from a linear to a more sustainable circular economy. Recently, the replacement of carbon-based fillers in polymers and biopolymers with biochar particles derived from thermochemical treatments of biomass waste has attracted increasing attention for its potentially critical role.In this work, sustainable bio-composites based on biodegradable poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT, and biochar, produced by controlled thermochemical treatments of biomass waste, were prepared by melt blending and their durability and performance were investigated in detail. Firstly, carob waste, after syrup extraction, was subjected to dry and wet thermochemical processes, i.e. slow pyrolysis at 280, 340 and 400 °C and hydrothermal carbonisation at 220, 250 and 280 °C, to obtain slow pyrolyzed biochar (SP-BC) and hydrothermal carbonised biochar (HTC-BC) particles. The SP-BC and HTC-BC, i.e. the solid phases resulting from the thermochemical processes, were characterised by elemental analysis and spectroscopy to study their physicochemical properties and by microscopy to analyse their morphology. Pure PBAT, PBAT/SP-BC and PBAT/HTC-BC bio-composites containing 10 % by weight of SP-BC and HTC-BC respectively were characterised by thermal, morphological, rheological and mechanical analyses. The results indicate that both types of particles exerted a reinforcing effect on PBAT and the resulting bio-composites were more thermo-mechanically stable compared to pure PBAT. Considering the potential application of these bio-composites as sustainable packaging materials, particular attention was paid to the photo-oxidation behaviour of these materials under accelerated artificial weathering conditions. Interestingly, both SP-BC and HTC-BC exerted a protective effect against the photooxidative ageing of PBAT, and this effect was more pronounced when HTC-BC was used.
