You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The prospect and limitation of high entropy alloy as 4th industrial material High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as an innovative family of multi-principal element alloys with unique properties that position them as potential candidates for the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) materials. Characterized by their multi-principal element composition, HEAs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and tailored functional properties. They leverage high configurational entropy to deliver superior performance over traditional alloys such as steel, aluminum, and titanium. HEAs have demonstrated remarkable potential in critical sectors, including aerospace, automotive, energy, and biomedicine, with examples like NbMoTaW in jet engines and TiZrNbTaMo in medical implants showcasing their versatility under extreme conditions. However, challenges such as high processing costs, difficulties in large-scale production, limited understanding of phase stability, and the need for advanced computational models to predict material behavior must be addressed. This paper explores the prospects of HEAs as the fourth industrial material, discussing their advantages, potential applications, and the limitations that must be overcome to realize their full industrial potential. By integrating emerging manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing and computational material design, HEAs could revolutionize material engineering and contribute significantly to Industry 4.0. Transitioning from niche innovations to industrial mainstays, mirroring the defining impact of steel in the First Industrial Revolution and silicon in the Third, thereby cementing their place at the forefront of Industry 4.0’s high-performance and sustainable future.
