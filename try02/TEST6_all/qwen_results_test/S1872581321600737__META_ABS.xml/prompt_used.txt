You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Changes in pyrolysis characteristics of agricultural residues before and after water washing Three agricultural residues (peanut straw, sorghum stalk and reed) were first pretreated by water washing, with which the pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a fixed bed reactor to investigate how the pyrolysis characteristics are changed by removing the alkali earth metals (AAEMs) and a part of fibrous components by water washing. The result shows that the water washing removes 52.7%–92.6% potassium and approximately half of neutral detergent solute (NDS) from three agricultural residues. The removal of AAEMs and NDS has a complex influence on the pyrolysis of agricultural residues, especially for peanut straw due to its higher contents of both AAEMs and NDS. However, the removal of AAEMs has an inhibitory effect on the reactions such as decarboxylation, decarbonylation, dehydrogenation and polycondensation, and the elution of NDS directly affects the yields and composition of gas and liquid products. For all three agricultural residues, overall, the water washing promotes the production of bio-oil and bio-char, but it lowers the gas yield. The bio-oils generated from the water-washed agricultural residues have higher proportions of oxygenates, especially sugars and furans, with lower proportions of hydrocarbons and nitrogenous compounds. Besides, after washing, the yields of CO2, CO and CH4 with peanut straw decrease significantly, while the proportion of long-chain fatty acids in bio oil increases.
