You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidative torrefaction of spruce-pine-fir sawdust in a slot-rectangular spouted bed reactor A slot-rectangular spouted bed (SRSB) reactor was employed to torrefy spruce-pine-fir sawdust in an oxidative atmosphere. The effects of torrefaction temperature (240–300 °C) and feed-gas oxygen concentration (3–9 vol.%) on torrefaction performance and solid product properties were investigated. Adding oxygen in the feed-gas led to more uniform temperature distributions in the SRSB reactor, and was a promising way to achieve stable continuous operation. The mass fraction of cyclone-caught torrefied biomass increased, whereas the mass fraction of torrefied biomass remaining in the reactor decreased, with increasing oxygen concentration and temperature. In oxidative torrefaction, biomass weight loss was 15.4–46.4%, while energy yield was 61.2–99.4%. The effects of oxygen concentration on the weight loss, energy yield and torrefied biomass properties were more significant at 300 °C than at 240 °C. The torrefied sawdust also had greater HHV and contained less volatiles, more carbon, less oxygen and less hydrogen than the raw biomass.
