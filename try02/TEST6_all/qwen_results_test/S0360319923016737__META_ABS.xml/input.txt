High-temperature reactor for hydrogen production by partial oxidation of hydrocarbons Today, conversion of hydrocarbons is one of the most common hydrogen production technologies. This paper presents a design of a high-temperature reactor — the main component of a hydrogen production unit using partial oxidation of hydrocarbons — as well as a physical model of gas generation. It also presents a schematic diagram of an experimental setup as well as results of experimental studies on steady-state modes of partial oxidation in the combustion chamber of a high-temperature reactor for various hydrocarbon feed/oxidant combinations. In the course of the study, we identified patterns that describe how the excess oxidant ratio affects the composition of products of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons to obtain hydrogen-containing gas of the required composition and parameters for hydrogen production. We propose a method to calculate nominal geometric dimensions of a high-temperature reactor, which makes it possible to estimate its weight and size at the design stage. The paper presents results of experimental studies confirming the adequacy of the proposed method.
