You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of micro/nanoplastics on the surface of polystyrene foam lunch boxes by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry In this work, membrane filtration and ultrafiltration centrifugation were used to separate and concentrate micro/nanoplastics attached on the surface of polystyrene (PS) foam lunch boxes. A pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) method was established to determine the content of PS micro/nanoplastics, expressed as a mass concentration, which was more suitable for the data comparison. The inner surface of a PS foam lunch box was rinsed with ultrapure water, and the PS microplastics in the rinse water were collected through a glass fiber membrane with pore size of 1 μm. Subsequently, an ultrafiltration centrifuge tube (100 kDa) was used to filter the filtrate again to collect the PS nanoplastics. The obtained PS micro/nanoplastics were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by Py-GC/MS. It was found that 8.52–11.43 μg/box of PS microplastics and 0.104–0.154 μg/box of PS nanoplastics were attached on the surface of three batches of PS foam lunch boxes. The detected mass of microplastics was 55.3–109.9 times that of nanoplastics. The particle number of PS nanoplastics is estimated about 1.21 × 10^7 and 1.79 × 10^7 items/box. The method validation showed that the absolute recoveries of PS microplastics and nanoplastics were 91.4 ± 11.3 % and 61.7 ± 7.5 %, respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can be applied to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of micro/nanoplastics on the surface of food contact materials, providing references for the safe use of food contact materials.
