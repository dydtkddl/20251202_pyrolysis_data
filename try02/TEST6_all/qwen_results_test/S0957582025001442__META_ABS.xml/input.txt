Beneficial reuse of pyrolytic post-remediation soil to activate persulfate oxidation and avoid exposure of environmentally persistent free radicals Petroleum-contaminated soil (PCS) requires an integrated strategy for remediation and value-added resource utilization. Pyrolysis can rapidly remediate PCS and recover liquid oil, but economically viable reuse strategies are needed for the vast volume of post-remediation soil with hazardous environmental permanent free radicals (EPFRs). This study reused the carbonized soil (CS) from PCS obtained by pyrolysis to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) oxidation. The CS pyrolysis at 500 °C for 15 min shows optimal activation performance for PS oxidation. The residual carbon in the soil is mainly graphitized carbon and amorphous carbon. Aniline (AN, 100 mg/L) can be completely removed when the doses of CS and PMS were 2 and 1.5 g/L, respectively. The quenching experiments, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and Linear Sweep Voltammetry analysis show that the main degradation mechanism of AN by CS-activated PS systems is direct electron transfer and singlet oxygen ( O 2 1 ) oxidation. The CS-activated PMS system shows much higher oxidation performance than the CS-activated PDS system by generation of more O 2 1 with oxygen-containing groups as the main active sites. Graphitized carbon and EPFRs mainly promote PMS oxidation by accelerating direct electron transfer. Therefore, reuse of the pyrolytic post-remediation soil as PMS activator not only achieves value-added resource utilization of PCS, but also avoids the environmental risks of EPFRs.
