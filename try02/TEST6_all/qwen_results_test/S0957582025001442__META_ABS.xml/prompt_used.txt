You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Beneficial reuse of pyrolytic post-remediation soil to activate persulfate oxidation and avoid exposure of environmentally persistent free radicals Petroleum-contaminated soil (PCS) requires an integrated strategy for remediation and value-added resource utilization. Pyrolysis can rapidly remediate PCS and recover liquid oil, but economically viable reuse strategies are needed for the vast volume of post-remediation soil with hazardous environmental permanent free radicals (EPFRs). This study reused the carbonized soil (CS) from PCS obtained by pyrolysis to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) oxidation. The CS pyrolysis at 500 °C for 15 min shows optimal activation performance for PS oxidation. The residual carbon in the soil is mainly graphitized carbon and amorphous carbon. Aniline (AN, 100 mg/L) can be completely removed when the doses of CS and PMS were 2 and 1.5 g/L, respectively. The quenching experiments, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and Linear Sweep Voltammetry analysis show that the main degradation mechanism of AN by CS-activated PS systems is direct electron transfer and singlet oxygen ( O 2 1 ) oxidation. The CS-activated PMS system shows much higher oxidation performance than the CS-activated PDS system by generation of more O 2 1 with oxygen-containing groups as the main active sites. Graphitized carbon and EPFRs mainly promote PMS oxidation by accelerating direct electron transfer. Therefore, reuse of the pyrolytic post-remediation soil as PMS activator not only achieves value-added resource utilization of PCS, but also avoids the environmental risks of EPFRs.
