You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted extraction as an effective method for the debromination of brominated flame retarded polymeric blends with a composition that simulates the plastic part of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) End-of-life plastics originating from waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) have increased enormously, along with the danger concerned with their treatment; due to the presence of toxic substances (such as brominated flame retardants) incorporated into them, which may be released during their recycling. The implementation of methods that remove these toxic compounds is necessary, before the recycling of the plastic waste. The present work investigates microwave-assisted extraction, as a pretreatment method before pyrolysis, with the aim of removing tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) from some polymeric blends, with composition that simulates the plastic part of WEEE. Different extractive conditions (extractive temperatures, solvent systems and times) were examined in order to find the optimal combination. Blends were analysed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) before and after the microwave pretreatment, so as to estimate the bromine reduction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the solvent systems used took place in order to explore the possible formation of additional peaks attributed to the transferring of TBBPA from the blends to the solvents, during the treatment. FTIR was also applied to the polymeric blends, showing that the structure of the polymers in the blends was maintained after the pretreatment, when the extractive temperature was set to 100 °C; something that was not observed at higher temperatures. Blends were subjected to pyrolysis before and after the microwave extraction, for the identification of the pyrolysis products. During all combinations of time and solvents tested (for 100 °C applied) bromine reduction was accomplished.
