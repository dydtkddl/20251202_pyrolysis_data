Microwave-assisted extraction as an effective method for the debromination of brominated flame retarded polymeric blends with a composition that simulates the plastic part of waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) End-of-life plastics originating from waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) have increased enormously, along with the danger concerned with their treatment; due to the presence of toxic substances (such as brominated flame retardants) incorporated into them, which may be released during their recycling. The implementation of methods that remove these toxic compounds is necessary, before the recycling of the plastic waste. The present work investigates microwave-assisted extraction, as a pretreatment method before pyrolysis, with the aim of removing tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) from some polymeric blends, with composition that simulates the plastic part of WEEE. Different extractive conditions (extractive temperatures, solvent systems and times) were examined in order to find the optimal combination. Blends were analysed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) before and after the microwave pretreatment, so as to estimate the bromine reduction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis of the solvent systems used took place in order to explore the possible formation of additional peaks attributed to the transferring of TBBPA from the blends to the solvents, during the treatment. FTIR was also applied to the polymeric blends, showing that the structure of the polymers in the blends was maintained after the pretreatment, when the extractive temperature was set to 100 °C; something that was not observed at higher temperatures. Blends were subjected to pyrolysis before and after the microwave extraction, for the identification of the pyrolysis products. During all combinations of time and solvents tested (for 100 °C applied) bromine reduction was accomplished.
