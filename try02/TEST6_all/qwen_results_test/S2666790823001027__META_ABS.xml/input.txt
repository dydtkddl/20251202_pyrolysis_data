CO2 utilization applied on converting of polyethylene terephthalate feedstock materials Carbon capture and utilization are crucial parts of minimizing the negative impacts of climate change caused by CO2 emissions. Furthermore, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has emerged as the predominant option for beverage packaging and textile fiber on a global scale. Moreover, CO2 capture and utilization can be a great solution to produce PET feedstocks effectively, such as ethylene glycol (EG), terephthalic acid (TPA), and dimethyl. Several strategies have been used to obtain the raw materials for PET production through CO2 utilization, including EG production from ethylene carbonate, EG production from coal, TPA production from benzene, TPA production from p-xylene, and EG production by the electrochemical process. CO2 utilization is often used for chemical production and recycling. However, there is limited information available regarding CO2 utilization in PET production and recycling. This review presents CO2 utilization for PET raw material supply and recycling from an environmental sustainability standpoint.
