You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen and carbon nanotube production from microwave-assisted catalytic decomposition of plastic waste Plastic waste has become an alternative resource for generating carbon-free hydrogen and valuable carbon. The challenge lies in the efficient catalytic pyrolysis of plastics, the energy-intensive nature of decomposition, and reactor configuration. In a single-stage process, the presence of solid plastic with the catalyst leads to carbon block formation, inhibiting the growth of filamentous structure. We proposed a two-stage process incorporating microwave-assisted heating, encompassing thermal pyrolysis at 500 ˚C, followed by catalytic chemical vapor deposition at 800 ˚C. Transition metals, including iron, nickel, and cobalt, and their alloys were examined for catalytic performance along with assessments of catalyst-to-feed mixing ratios and catalyst stability. Comprehensive characterization techniques were employed to explore nanocrystal size, dispersion, reduction behavior, and support interaction strength. The FeNi/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest yields among the selected catalysts, attributed to its optimized nanocrystalline size and interaction strength. These characteristics facilitated the production of 445 mg/gplastic of carbon nanotubes and 52.1 mmol/gplastic of hydrogen during low-density polyethylene decomposition, corresponding to the extraction of 52 % carbon and 72 % hydrogen relative to theoretical content. The catalyst exhibited a sustained efficiency over ten consecutive cycles, yielding 513 mg/gplastic of highly crystalline multiwall carbon nanotubes, with electrification demonstrating promise for sustainably converting plastic waste into carbon-free hydrogen and carbon.
