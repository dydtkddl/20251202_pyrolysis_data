You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of residual tyres: Exergy and kinetics of pyrogas Around 1.5 billion tyres are produced each year, with a huge percentage ending up in landfills. Residual rubber tyres have a calorific value of 39–42 MJkg−1, making them an appealing candidate for pyrolysis. The goal of this project is converting discarded tyres into pyro-energy. A single column fixed bed batch pyrolyzer was built to pyrolyzer residual tyres.The residual tyres that were left over were ground into a fine powder. An elemental analyser was used to quantify the amount of total hydrogen, sulphur, carbon and nitrogen in powdered residual tyres. Thermo Gravimetric Analysis at different rates of heating, including Thermo Gravimetric Analysis at different rates of heat, including 5 °C min−1, 10 °C min-1 and 15 °C min-1, was used to assess the thermal deterioration profile of the residual tyres.The residual tyres were thermally cracked at temperatures between 450 and 550 °C, with each increment of 50 °C. Each trail's pyro-gas was monitored separately, and the exergy was calculated using thermodynamic rules. To estimate kinetic factors such as activation energy and reaction sequence, four distinct model-free approaches were used. Friedman's activation energy on average has been determined as 127.35 kJ mol−1. At 550 °C, a high of 52.11% of Pyro-gas was detected. The maximum energy and exergy were 5.49 MJkg−1 and 4.92 MJkg−1 respectively.
