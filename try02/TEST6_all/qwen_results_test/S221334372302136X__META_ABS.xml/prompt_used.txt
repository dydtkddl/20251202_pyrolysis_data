You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Boosting the selective catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste polylactic acid to monomer Polylactic acid (PLA), as the most popular biodegradable polymers, has considered as a potential substitute for the petroleum-based plastics, but its large-scale applications are still limited because of lacking advisable wastes management strategies. Herein, we report a heterogeneous bimetallic FeNi catalyst for the selective catalytic pyrolysis of PLA to monomer under the isothermal temperature, solvent-free conditions. A series of Fe-based catalysts were prepared with a view to facilitate lactide conversion and improve its selectivity by tuning the properties of all Fe species. The optimal catalyst Fe10Ni1 @NC shows excellent catalytic performance with a 73% yield of lactide, which is mainly attributed to the “synergistic effect” between all Fe species sites and FeNi alloys and the basic of N-dope carbon matrix. It’s discovered that Fe/Fe,C/Fe3O4 sites are beneficial for the cleavage of ester linkages, and the FeNi alloys formed by introducing low amounts of Ni to Fe sites show better selectivity for the ring cyclization step. This work not only develops the pyrolysis methods of biodegradable plastic wastes to obtain the high-value chemicals and also contributes toward a circular economy.
