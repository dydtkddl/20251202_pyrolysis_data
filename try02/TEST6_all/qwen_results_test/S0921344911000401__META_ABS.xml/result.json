  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study uses thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with dynamic heating rates but lacks measurable product yields or experimental data from a reactor system, and it focuses on kinetic modeling rather than lab-scale pyrolysis experiments with quantifiable outputs."
