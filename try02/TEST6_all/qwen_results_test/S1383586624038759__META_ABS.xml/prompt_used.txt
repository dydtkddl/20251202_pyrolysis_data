You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bleached cellulose biochars as a sustainable alternative for oilfield-produced water (OPW) treatment and environmental remediation Eucalyptus, a renewable and fast-growing raw material widely used in the paper industry, has great potential for new applications beyond papermaking. Bleached eucalyptus pulp, traditionally used in the pulp industry, has proved to be a promising alternative for removing complex organic compounds such as naphthenic acids (NAs), often found in oil-produced water (OPW). This study aimed to optimize the production of biochars from bleached eucalyptus pulp through pyrolysis at 700, 800, and 900 °C and to correlate the resulting properties with the ability to adsorb NA at low concentrations and in acidic and alkaline media. The research explores realistic environmental scenarios where naphthenic acids may be present in dilute concentrations after initial treatments. The biochars were characterized by their micro and mesoporous structures, amorphous structures, and distinct functional groups and were evaluated in simulated effluents. Biochar B900 reached a maximum adsorption capacity of 35 mg/g at pH 4 and 25 °C, excelling in acidic environments, while at pH 8, biochar B700 showed better performance. The PVSDM model revealed that mass transfer and pore diffusion coefficients increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The Langmuir model was the best fit for the experimental data. The biochar produced at 900 °C had the highest specific surface area (1,041.55 m2/g) and pore volume (0.56 cm3 g−1), favoring its adsorption capacity. Although the biochar shows good initial efficiency, the progressive reduction in adsorption capacity over the cycles suggests limited reusability, highlighting the need for optimization in the regeneration process to improve its economic viability in wastewater treatment.
