Bleached cellulose biochars as a sustainable alternative for oilfield-produced water (OPW) treatment and environmental remediation Eucalyptus, a renewable and fast-growing raw material widely used in the paper industry, has great potential for new applications beyond papermaking. Bleached eucalyptus pulp, traditionally used in the pulp industry, has proved to be a promising alternative for removing complex organic compounds such as naphthenic acids (NAs), often found in oil-produced water (OPW). This study aimed to optimize the production of biochars from bleached eucalyptus pulp through pyrolysis at 700, 800, and 900 °C and to correlate the resulting properties with the ability to adsorb NA at low concentrations and in acidic and alkaline media. The research explores realistic environmental scenarios where naphthenic acids may be present in dilute concentrations after initial treatments. The biochars were characterized by their micro and mesoporous structures, amorphous structures, and distinct functional groups and were evaluated in simulated effluents. Biochar B900 reached a maximum adsorption capacity of 35 mg/g at pH 4 and 25 °C, excelling in acidic environments, while at pH 8, biochar B700 showed better performance. The PVSDM model revealed that mass transfer and pore diffusion coefficients increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The Langmuir model was the best fit for the experimental data. The biochar produced at 900 °C had the highest specific surface area (1,041.55 m2/g) and pore volume (0.56 cm3 g−1), favoring its adsorption capacity. Although the biochar shows good initial efficiency, the progressive reduction in adsorption capacity over the cycles suggests limited reusability, highlighting the need for optimization in the regeneration process to improve its economic viability in wastewater treatment.
