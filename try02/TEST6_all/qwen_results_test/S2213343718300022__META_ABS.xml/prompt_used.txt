You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption of Bisphenol A on KOH-activated tyre pyrolysis char An activated carbon (AC) with a specific surface area of 700 m2 g−1 was prepared by KOH activation of tyre pyrolysis char (TPC) and tested to remove Bisphenol A (BPA) from aqueous solutions. BPA adsorption on this AC was evaluated by studying both the adsorption isotherms at three different temperatures and the decrease of BPA concentration with time, in order to determine the thermodynamic and the kinetic parameters, respectively. The results were compared with those obtained with pristine TPC and with a multipurpose commercial activated carbon (CAC) recommended for BPA adsorption. The present KOH-activated TPC showed a great potential to adsorb BPA with a monolayer capacity as high as 123 mg g−1, higher than that of the CAC used as a reference. BPA adsorption equilibrium data were fitted using different isotherm models with two or three parameters, and the best fitting models were those of Langmuir and Radke-Prausnitz. BPA adsorption was an exothermic process, and the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing temperature. The adsorption kinetics of BPA was adequately described by a pseudo-second order model.
