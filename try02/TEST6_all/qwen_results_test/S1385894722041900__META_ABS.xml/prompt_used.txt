You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic modeling of the hydrocracking of polystyrene blended with vacuum gasoil The kinetic modeling of the hydrocracking of a mixture of polystyrene (PS) and vacuum gasoil (VGO) over a PtPd/HY catalyst has been carried out. The reactions have been performed in a batch reactor under the following conditions: 380–420 °C; 80 bar; content of PS in the feed, 10 wt%; catalyst/feed ratio, 0.1 in mass; and time, 30–300 min. Different reaction networks and kinetic models have been studied, in which the evolution of product distribution (unconverted PS, dry gas, liquefied petroleum gases, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke) with the extent of time has been quantified by considering three different simultaneous deactivation mechanisms (plastic fouling, coke deposition and metal poisoning). The kinetic model selected (based on a 7-lump reaction network) has been used for performing a parametric study, determining that 400 °C and 180 min are the optimal conditions for maximizing the yield of naphtha (35 wt%) at the same time that PS is totally converted. This original kinetic model may act as a basis for scaling-up studies focused on the large-scale valorization of waste plastics by co-feeding them into a hydrocracking unit of a Waste-Refinery.
