You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of microplastics on microbial community dynamics in sediments from the Volturno River ecosystem, Italy In this study, the sources, abundance, and ecological implications of microplastic (MP) pollution in Volturno, one of the main rivers in southern Italy, were explored by investigating the MP concentration levels in sediments collected along the watercourse. The samples were sieved through 5- and 2-mm sieves and treated with selective organic solvents. The polymer classes polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), nylon 6 (PA6), and nylon 6,6 (PA66) were quantified using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, a 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis was performed using next-generation sequencing in Ion Torrent™ to explore the bacterial taxonomy and ecological dynamics of sediment samples. The MPs were detected in all samples collected from the study area. PP and PET were the most abundant and frequently detected polymer types in the analysed samples. The total MP concentration ranged from 1.05 to 14.55 ppm (parts per million), identifying two distinct data populations: high- and low-MP-contaminated sediments. According to the Polymer Hazard Index (PHI), MP pollution was categorised as hazard levels III and IV (corresponding to the danger category). Metagenomic data revealed that the presence of MPs significantly affected the abundance of bacterial taxa; Flavobacteraceae and Nocardiaceae, which are known to degrade polymeric substances, were present in high-MP-contaminated sediments. This study provides new insights into the ecological relevance of MP pollution and suggests that microorganisms may serve as biomarkers of MP pollution.
