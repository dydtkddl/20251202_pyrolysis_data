You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bioenergy production by integrated microwave-assisted torrefaction and pyrolysis The global shift towards renewable and sustainable energy sources demands a more efficient conversion of agricultural biomass into sustainable energy. The integration of microwave heating with thermochemical conversion processes of biomass into biofuels has garnered attention due to faster reaction times, improved selectivity, and reduced energy consumption compared to conventional heating. Despite the promise shown by various thermochemical approaches, there remains a gap in the literature regarding systematic reviews of microwave-assisted torrefaction and pyrolysis as an integrated technology and comparisons to other thermochemical routes to assess its potential. Therefore, this review addresses recent advancements in microwave-assisted torrefaction and pyrolysis, discussing feasibility, optimization studies, key factors influencing product yield and properties (bio-oil, biogas, and biochar), and future research directions. The assessment reveals the merits and drawbacks of this combined technology compared to other integrated approaches like gasification, combustion, and liquefaction. The outcomes have shown solid yields exceeding 95 % as the main product and 37 % of bio-oil yield. However, previous research underestimates the complexities of establishing microwave reactors, particularly in scaling up. The findings emphasize the potential of microwave-assisted torrefaction and pyrolysis as an integrated process with broad implications for sustainable energy transitions.
