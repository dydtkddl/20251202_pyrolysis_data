Thermal-catalytic degradation kinetics of polypropylene over BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites In this study, thermal degradation of additive-free polypropylene powder over different type of zeolite catalysts was investigated. BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR with different surface areas, pore structures, acidities and Si/Al molar ratios were used as solid catalysts for degradation of polypropylene (PP). Degradation rate of the PP over zeolites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) employing four different heating rates and apparent activation energies of the processes were determined by the Kissinger equation. The catalytic activity of zeolites decreases as BEA>ZSM-5a (Si/Al=12.5)>ZSM-5b (Si/Al=25)>MOR depending on pore size and acidity of the catalysts. On the other hand, initial degradation is relatively faster over MOR and BEA than that over both ZSM-5 catalysts depending on the apparent activation energy. It can be concluded that acidity of the catalyst is the most important parameter in determining the activity for polymer degradation process as well as other structural parameters, such as pore structure and size.
