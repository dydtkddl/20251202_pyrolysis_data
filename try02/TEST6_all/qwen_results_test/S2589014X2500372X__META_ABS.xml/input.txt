Multifunctional roles of biogenic acids in the chemistry of renewables: From catalysts and reagents to reaction media There has been a growing emphasis on sourcing various chemical components, such as substrates, reagents, catalysts, and solvents, from biomass feedstock for enhanced sustainability in organic transformations. Biogenic carboxylic acids (BCAs), produced by chemocatalytic or enzymatic biomass conversion, are increasingly used in sustainable organic synthesis. Formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, and oxalic acid in their aqueous solution or undiluted form are increasingly used as acid catalysts, reagents, and reaction media for the chemistry of renewables. This work reviews recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field of research, highlighting significant achievements and addressing key challenges. For better clarity, the mechanistic aspects, substrate scopes, and reaction conditions have been elaborated. The analyses presented in this manuscript will help broaden the applications of BCAs in sustainable organic synthesis and biorefinery processes.
