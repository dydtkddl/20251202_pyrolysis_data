Microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis coupled with microwave-absorbent of soapstock for bio-oil in a downdraft reactor Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of biomass with HZSM-5 coupled with SiC as microwave-absorbent in a downdraft reactor is a promising method for obtaining hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil. The hydrocarbon content limits the economic and commercial viability of the bio-oil produced by pyrolysis. In this study, the effects of catalytic temperature, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio, and WHSV on the yield and composition of bio-oil are studied. In addition, this study compared the influence of downdraft reaction and updraft reaction on the yield and composition of bio-oil. Furthermore, the stability of the catalyst is studied. Catalytic temperature and feedstock-to-catalyst ratio played pivotal roles in the yield and composition of bio-oil. WHSV has minimal influence on the bio-oil yield and composition within the scope of our research. Furthermore, the optimal catalytic temperature, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio and WHSV were 400 °C, 2:1, and 72 h−1, respectively. The results illustrated that the downdraft coupled with the microwave-absorbent was conducive to the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. The HZSM-5 performed well in five replicate experimental cycles under optimal conditions in terms of bio-oil yield and aromatic hydrocarbon yield.
