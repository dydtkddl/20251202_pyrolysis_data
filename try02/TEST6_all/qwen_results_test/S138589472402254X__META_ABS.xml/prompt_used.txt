You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel high-entropy spinel ferrites (CoNiCuZnMg)Fe2O4 catalyst for H2 production via steam reforming of derived volatiles from polypropylene and waste cooking oil Municipal organic waste conversion to high-value products is a vital carbon–neutral way to simultaneously tackle the energy crisis and environmental contamination. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel high-entropy spinel ferrites (Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Mg0.2)Fe2O4 catalyst (HEO) toward H2 production from co-pyrolysis volatiles of polypropylene (PP) and waste cooking oil (WCO) in an integrated two-stage reactor system. In the 1st stage of medium temperature reforming, the optimal 3:7 PP/WCO blend mass ratio facilitated H2 production. Under a catalytic reforming at high temperature of 750 °C in the 2nd stage, the HEO catalyst demonstrated remarkable efficiency, yielding 58.43 mmol·g−1 of H2 with a composition of 65.17 %, a notable 22.3 times higher than that without HEO. The catalyst exhibited a prolonged service life of 540 min without compromising H2 selectivity, maintaining a high yield of 510.2 mmol·gcat. −1·s−1. The exceptional performance of HEO arises from the synergistic effects of multiple elements, augments oxygen vacancy, enhances reducibility, and promotes structural stability in the high-entropy system, which causes the strong C–C breaking ability and the excellent C–H breaking abilities of Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Zn species. The analysis of tar, gaseous products, and deactivated HEO catalyst characterization results provides a comprehensive understanding of the co-pyrolysis route and volatiles catalytic reforming process. This study developed a high-entropy ferrite catalyst that not only achieves efficient and stable H2 production but also lays the foundation for a new high-entropy catalyst design concept, fostering the development of efficient reforming catalysts for H2 production.
