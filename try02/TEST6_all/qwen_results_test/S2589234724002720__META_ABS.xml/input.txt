A review on sustainable PET recycling: Strategies and trends Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a multifaceted thermoplastic polymer that has taken over the packaging industry. However, the increasing concern over the non-biodegradable PET waste management techniques and the urgent need for sustainability have made PET recycling an absolute necessity. This article delves deep into the current trends in handling today's PET wastes and simultaneously converting them into value-added products. It provides a comprehensive understanding of PET recycling techniques, viz: physical, chemical and biological recycling, highlighting the current trends. Moreover, an emphasis is also provided on the current industrial recycling sector to make it easier for the future research. It focuses on the conversion of chemically recycled PET-waste monomers into various secondary upcycled products that have wide applications in the biomedical, energy and paint industries. It emphasizes the importance of the secondary upcycling techniques to support resource conservation and sustainability. This article aims to inspire and encourage individuals and industries to take action towards a greener future.
