You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Auger reactors for pyrolysis of biomass and wastes Pyrolysis is one of the most efficient and environmentally attractive thermochemical processes for conversion of both biomass and wastes to energy products. This review focuses on the use of auger reactors, also known as screw reactors, for the pyrolysis of carbonaceous solids into liquid, gaseous and solid products that can be used in the production of fuels and other valued-added products. The auger reactor is attractive for its versatility in transforming a wide range of feedstocks, and has been recognized as one of the technologies with better strengths not only for fast pyrolysis, but also for slow or intermediate pyrolysis. Auger pyrolyzers are of relatively simple design and overcome some of the problems of conveying heat for pyrolyzing biomass or wastes. The mechanical forces associated with auger reactors enhance particle mixing and heat transfer, which are key to successful pyrolysis. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the advantages and challenges of this technology and identify the main characteristics of both single- and twin-screw auger technology. The effect of operating conditions on yield and some properties of pyrolysis products are also provided. The review includes examples of commercial/demonstration-scale auger pyrolysis plants operated around the world.
