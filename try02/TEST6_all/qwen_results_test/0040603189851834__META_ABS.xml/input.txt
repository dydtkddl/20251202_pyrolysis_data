The thermogravimetry and pyrolysis of date stones The Al-Zahdi date stone as a source of energy and valuable chemicals is described. Thermogravimetry indicated that the material loses ca. 12% of its weight below 200 °C. The main decomposition reaction occurs above 205 ° C and attains a maximum rate at 312° C and resulted in the loss of ca. 50% of the initial weight. The decomposition is slightly affected by atmospheric oxygen especially at high temperatures(⪢ 400°C). The pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a pyrex reactor at 400 ° C, where the sample was held on a sintered-glass disc and fluidized by an upward flow of N2 gas. The gas, tar and solid yields of the pyrolysis were 41.5, 16.3 and 41.6%, respectively. The gaseous product was analysed and recommendations are given for the best use of the pyrolytic products.
