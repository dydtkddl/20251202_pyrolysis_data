You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High temperature pyrolysis of sewage sludge: Synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis with rice straw and composite plastics wastes The synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis for the mixtures of sewage sludge (SS), rice straw (RS) and composite plastic wastes (PE&PP) has been investigated with the aim of high gas yields and hydrogen generation. In this context, the applicability of high temperature pyrolysis technology was evaluated at both rotary type batch reactor and rotating screw type continuous reactor operating under the industrially relevant conditions. Gas yields have been improved at increasing the operating temperatures up to 850 °C. The gas yield of 75.06 % with its H2 portion of 32.35 % has been achieved as the best results for continuous pyrolysis unit at pilot scale. Secondary reactions such as steam de-alkylation, steam cracking, water gas shift and so on were regarded as being responsible for the high gas yields when the primary products of pyrolysis, i.e. condensable vapors, were much exposed to the hot zones inside the reactor. The dehydration of organic components involving the loss of water may supply steam to create a reactive pyrolysis atmosphere. While the pyrolysis of sewage sludge and rice straw favors CO and CO2 formation due to the high oxygen contents of these feedstocks, more methane and light olefins were produced when the plastics were added to the feedstock blends. This was ascribed to the initially generated radicals from the decomposition of sewage sludge and/or rice straw that might promote the scission reactions of plastics towards volatiles. It was shown that high temperature pyrolysis can be applied to a variety of organic wastes such as rice straw, sewage sludge and waste plastics. Conversion of wastes to hydrogen fosters the circular economy by putting the disposal costs down and creates a new route on renewable hydrogen generation.
