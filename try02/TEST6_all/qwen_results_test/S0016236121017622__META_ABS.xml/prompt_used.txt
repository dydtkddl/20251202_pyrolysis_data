You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An optimized thermal cracking approach for onsite upgrading of bitumen Onsite partial upgrading is a promising strategy for facilitating pipeline transportation of bitumen without the use of diluent. In the present work, a one-step treatment using an autoclave is optimized toward upgrading Alberta bitumen of 9.6 API gravity and 925,000 cP viscosity. The thermal cracking process was kept simple in order to maintain an economic and environmental advantage. Optimum conditions entailed 75 min of reaction time at 420 °C, without quenching the reactor. These conditions corresponded to highest centrifuged oil product yield of 73.3 ± 1.1 wt%, viscosity of 34 ± 2 cP and API gravity of 18.9 ± 0.5. H-NMR, CHNS and FTIR measurements revealed thermally cracked asphaltenes having more aromatic parts with shorter aliphatic side chains. Subsequently, the P-value of the thermally cracked product was much lower (1.11) than the bitumen feed (3.9) and was not impacted by quenching. Nevertheless, the degradation of viscosity and API gravity of the oil product and its centrifuged cut were less than 5% after 12 days.
