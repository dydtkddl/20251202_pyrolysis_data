Upgrading MSW pyrolysis oil through distillation and hydrotreatment for automobile engine applications: A short review The demand for fossil fuel in today’s world is increasing at a higher pace with rapid population growth and industrial development. The reserve for petroleum-based fossil fuels is finite which necessitates the search for alternative fuels. Pyrolysis oil obtained from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) has drawn the attention of many researchers because of their high heating value and similar fuel properties with commercial automobile fuel and has potential to substitute commercial diesel fuel. Nevertheless, the crude oil obtained from pyrolysis of MSW has some shortcomings such as higher viscosity and density, lower flash point and cetane index, unpleasant odor, and higher sulfur content, preventing its useability as a drop in fuel for automobiles at present. In this short review, distillation and hydrotreatment post treatment procedures, amongst many others, are discussed for improving the properties of pyrolysis crude oil. Focus has been given on waste plastic and waste automobile tire pyrolysis oils as they constitute a significant amount of MSW currently. This review reported that noticeable improvement of the properties (cetane number, flash point, viscosity, and sulphur contents) of crude pyrolysis oil (PPO or TPO) can be achieved through distillation and/or hydrotreatment, which are comparable to the properties of standard diesel.
