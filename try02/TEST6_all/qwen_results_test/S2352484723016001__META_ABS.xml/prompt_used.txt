You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading MSW pyrolysis oil through distillation and hydrotreatment for automobile engine applications: A short review The demand for fossil fuel in today’s world is increasing at a higher pace with rapid population growth and industrial development. The reserve for petroleum-based fossil fuels is finite which necessitates the search for alternative fuels. Pyrolysis oil obtained from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) has drawn the attention of many researchers because of their high heating value and similar fuel properties with commercial automobile fuel and has potential to substitute commercial diesel fuel. Nevertheless, the crude oil obtained from pyrolysis of MSW has some shortcomings such as higher viscosity and density, lower flash point and cetane index, unpleasant odor, and higher sulfur content, preventing its useability as a drop in fuel for automobiles at present. In this short review, distillation and hydrotreatment post treatment procedures, amongst many others, are discussed for improving the properties of pyrolysis crude oil. Focus has been given on waste plastic and waste automobile tire pyrolysis oils as they constitute a significant amount of MSW currently. This review reported that noticeable improvement of the properties (cetane number, flash point, viscosity, and sulphur contents) of crude pyrolysis oil (PPO or TPO) can be achieved through distillation and/or hydrotreatment, which are comparable to the properties of standard diesel.
