You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic insights and kinetics of torrefaction of pine wood biomasses using solid-state NMR The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential use of torrefied biomass of the genus Pinus, in the form of wood bark (CC), chips (CV) and wood pellets (PP), as substitutes for metallurgical coke to reduce the high CO2 emissions from the use of metallurgical coke in blast furnaces. Thermogravimetric analysis were used to optimize the torrefaction temperature (250 °C or 290 °C), residence time (30 or 60 min) under inert atmosphere. All of the torrefied biomasses were analyzed to determine physical and chemical characteristics (proximate analyses, ultimate analyses, higher calorific value (HHV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ss-NMR. The composition of condensable and non-condensable gases formed during torrefaction process were also measured. The results showed that the two most promising biomasses were CV and PP torrefied at a temperature of 290 °C at a residence time of 30 min. The kinetics of torrefaction was analyzed by solid state ss-NMR characterization of the torrefied biomass at different time reactions and temperature (250–290 °C) under inert atmosphere, and followed a pseudo-first order kinetic model. The kinetics of evolution of ss-NMR signals related to C-1 of cellulose; C-4 of cellulose in ordered cellulose; C-4 of cellulose in disordered/amorphous cellulose; C-6 of cellulose, and carbon atoms of methoxyl groups in lignins, at different temperatures were used to estimate the activation energy, and values in the range 11–25 kJ mol−1 were obtained.
