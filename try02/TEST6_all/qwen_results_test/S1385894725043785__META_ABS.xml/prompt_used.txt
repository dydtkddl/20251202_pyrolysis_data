You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal decomposition mechanisms of m-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene under low-pressure conditions Nitroaromatics are a class of hazardous chemicals that pose significant safety risks during storage, transportation, and usage due to their flammability nature. Reliable prediction of fundamental combustion parameters such as burning velocity relies on accurate reaction mechanisms of nitroaromatics combustion. The present study examines the pyrolysis of two prototype nitroaromatic compounds, m-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene, in a flow reactor under low-pressure conditions with the temperature ranging from 650 to 1050 K. Dozens of intermediates and products were detected for the first time in our pyrolysis experiments using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry. New species were observed including NO2, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), isocyanic acid (HNCO), acetonitrile (CH3CN), carbon monoxide, acetylene, propyne, vinylacetylene, 1,3-cyclopentadiene, benzene and methylphenols. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the possible decomposition pathways of m-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene with the CCSD(T)-F12A/cc-pVTZ-F12//M06-2X/def2-TZVP methods. Reaction kinetic simulations were performed to calculate the rate coefficients over a wide temperature and pressure range. The CNO2 bond cleavage and nitro-nitrite isomerization followed by instantaneous NO elimination were identified as the most important primary decomposition pathways of m- and p-nitrotoluene. Subsequent reactions of key radicals generated in the initial decomposition, CH3C6H4• and CH3C6H4O•, can further dissociate into various smaller fragments, with C2–C6 unsaturated hydrocarbons and CO being the most dominant. Small nitrogen-containing molecules and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were also detected in the experiments and their possible formation pathways were proposed. The thermal decomposition mechanisms elucidated in this work provide an important foundation for future development of highly predictive combustion kinetic models of nitroaromatic compounds.
