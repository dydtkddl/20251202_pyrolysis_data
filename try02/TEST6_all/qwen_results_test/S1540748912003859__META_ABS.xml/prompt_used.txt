You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nascent tar formation during polyvinylchloride (PVC) pyrolysis Pyrolysis experiments of polyvinylchloride (PVC) were performed to investigate the effects of peak temperature, holding time, and heating rate on the formation of nascent tar. The nascent tar samples were collected using a wire-mesh reactor where the secondary reactions of the evolved volatiles were minimized. The small compounds, such as benzenes and alkanes, were not detected in nascent tar in wire-mesh reactor, whose components are quite different from those of other tars in tube type reactor and vacuum reactor. At a heating rate of 1000K/s, the quasi-3 rings and 3 rings group aromatics were the major components in nascent tar; while the content of 2 rings group aromatics increased from 7.02% to 31.75% with increasing peak temperature from 500 to 800°C. At a longer holding time of 300s, an increase of 2 rings group aromatics from 7.02% to 50.33% was also observed for the nascent tar at 500°C, indicating that the tar composition significantly changed at different stages of PVC pyrolysis. It seems that 3–4 rings compounds form in the early stage and then 2 rings compounds release in the later stage of PVC pyrolysis. Based on the experimental results in this work, a new four-stage mechanism, including (1) dechlorination accompanied with inner cyclization, (2) aromatic chain scission, (3) release of quasi-3 rings or 3 rings group, and (4) release of 2 rings group, of the PVC tar formation was proposed.
