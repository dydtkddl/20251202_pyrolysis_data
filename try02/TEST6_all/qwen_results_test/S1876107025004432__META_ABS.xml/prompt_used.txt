You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular structure-driven mechanistic insights into the thermally inert refining processes for anthracite conversion Background Anthracite, characterized by its high structural order and carbon content, offers unique potential for fabrication of advanced carbon materials. However, the molecular mechanisms governing its thermally inert refining processes (TIRP) remain unclear, particularly the dynamic evolution of polyaromatic networks and CC/C—X bonds cleavage-reorganization during thermal treatment. Methods This study investigates Rujigou anthracite from Ningxia, China through an integrated approach combining material characterization, controlled thermal treatment experiments, and molecular modeling calculations. Significant Findings Accurately reproduced the ordered 3D configuration, carbonization behavior, and oriented aromatic stacking of RJG-OM during TIRP at the atomic scale. Integrated micro/macro-scale analysis revealed a three-stage TIRP mechanism: bond cleavage without new fragments below 330 °C; aromatic collapse and carbon rearrangement at 330∼810 °C; volatile release and aromatic expansion dominating skeleton reorganization above 810 °C. Heteroatom removal involved triphase C=O evolution N-6→N-5 conversion. The release of oxygen from C=O primarily occurs through decarboxylation-induced growth, pyrolysis equilibrium, and high-temperature restructuring. The transformation of nitrogen-containing heterocycles from N-6 to N-5 follows a hydrogenation-ring opening-reconstruction pathway, accompanied by a nearly linear increase in N-5 content and a synchronous decrease in N-6/NOx levels.
