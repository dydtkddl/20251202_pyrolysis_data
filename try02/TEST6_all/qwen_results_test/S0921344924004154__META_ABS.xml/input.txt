Hydrothermal liquefaction of plastic marine debris from the North Pacific Garbage Patch Ocean plastic waste poses a growing environmental threat, efforts are now underway to help clean the ocean surface or to prevent plastic streams entering. Repurposing these highly mixed polymers presents a great challenge due to their inherent complexity, intertanglement, and the presence of contaminants. Herein, we process real samples of ocean-floating plastics from the North Pacific Garage Patch through supercritical hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), targeting their chemical recycling into synthetic crude oil. Investigating key process parameters (temperature, pressure, time, and plastic load), we found that plastic load and temperature are crucial parameters influencing oil yield and that moderate conditions maximized hydrocarbon yield, reaching 90 wt%. Overall, longer residence times and higher temperatures favored aromatic-rich oils. We suggest a reaction pathway to account for hydrogen release from aromatization reactions, influencing paraffin, olefin, and aromatic contents. Supercritical HTL offers an effective, tailored approach for recycling complex plastic mixtures to produce synthetic crude oil.
