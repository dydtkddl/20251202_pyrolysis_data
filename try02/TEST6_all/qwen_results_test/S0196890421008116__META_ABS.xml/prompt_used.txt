You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conceptual design and comprehensive analysis for novel municipal sludge gasification-based hydrogen production via plasma gasifier Aiming to solve the problems of the environment and land occupied by municipal sludge incineration and landfill technology, novel processes of municipal sludge-to-H2 by plasma gasification and municipal sludge-to-H2 by plasma gasification coupled with synthetic chemical looping processes are proposed to convert municipal sludge into H2 and achieve carbon capture. On the basis of the simulation results, the performance of the two processes was explored through a comprehensive analysis of the process exergy efficiency, economic benefits, and environmental impact. The results show that the novel processes have higher energy conversion and utilization efficiencies. Municipal sludge-to-H2 by the plasma gasification process has notable advantages in production capacity, which is 21.22% higher than that of municipal sludge-to-H2 by plasma gasification coupled with synthetic chemical looping process. However, its exergy efficiency and financial internal rate of return are 6.98% and 4.59%, respectively, which is lower than those of municipal sludge-to-H2 by plasma gasification coupled with synthetic chemical looping. In addition, its total capital investment, global warming potential, and acidification potential are 5.73%, 58.14%, and 16.59% higher than municipal sludge-to-H2 by plasma gasification coupled with synthetic chemical looping. The proposed processes provide promising methods for solving the problems of municipal sludge treatment and the profitable and environmentally sustainable development of municipal sludge into H2.
