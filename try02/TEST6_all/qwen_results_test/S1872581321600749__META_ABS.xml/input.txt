Synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of pre-dechlorination treated PVC residue and Pingshuo coal Pyrolysis is an effective way for clean and efficient use of coal, as well as an important way for efficient conversion of waste plastics. A two-step treatment scheme was proposed for chlorine-containing plastics that are difficult to be treated harmlessly. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Pingshuo (PS) coal were used in this study. The PVC was preheated to remove most of the chlorine, and then the pretreated PVC residue (DPVC) and coal were co-pyrolyzed. GC, simulated distillation, GC-MS, elemental analysis, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze and characterize composition and properties of pyrolysis gas, tar and char. The results show that co-pyrolysis process of DPVC and PS coal has a synergistic effect, and has an obvious positive synergistic effect on formation of char and tar. The experimental value of tar yield is higher than theoretical calculation and the maximum increasing value is 3.35%. There is a negative synergistic effect on formation of pyrolysis water and gas, in which CH4 has the largest decrease in yield, meaning the strongest negative synergy. Co-pyrolysis increases content of light tar, significantly increases content of naphthalenes, and reduces that of asphalt. When DPVC addition is 10%, content of light tar increases by 5 percentage points over the theoretical calculation value. In addition, the co-pyrolysis char surface is smoother, its structure becomes more orderly, and graphitization degree increases.
