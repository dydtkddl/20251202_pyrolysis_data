You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of pre-dechlorination treated PVC residue and Pingshuo coal Pyrolysis is an effective way for clean and efficient use of coal, as well as an important way for efficient conversion of waste plastics. A two-step treatment scheme was proposed for chlorine-containing plastics that are difficult to be treated harmlessly. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and Pingshuo (PS) coal were used in this study. The PVC was preheated to remove most of the chlorine, and then the pretreated PVC residue (DPVC) and coal were co-pyrolyzed. GC, simulated distillation, GC-MS, elemental analysis, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze and characterize composition and properties of pyrolysis gas, tar and char. The results show that co-pyrolysis process of DPVC and PS coal has a synergistic effect, and has an obvious positive synergistic effect on formation of char and tar. The experimental value of tar yield is higher than theoretical calculation and the maximum increasing value is 3.35%. There is a negative synergistic effect on formation of pyrolysis water and gas, in which CH4 has the largest decrease in yield, meaning the strongest negative synergy. Co-pyrolysis increases content of light tar, significantly increases content of naphthalenes, and reduces that of asphalt. When DPVC addition is 10%, content of light tar increases by 5 percentage points over the theoretical calculation value. In addition, the co-pyrolysis char surface is smoother, its structure becomes more orderly, and graphitization degree increases.
