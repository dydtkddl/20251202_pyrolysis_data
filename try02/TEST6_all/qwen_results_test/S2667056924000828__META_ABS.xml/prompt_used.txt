You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of pyrolysis heating rate on the mesoporosity of Pluronic F-127 templated carbon xerogels This study explored the impact of pyrolysis heating rates ranging from 1 to 20 K min−1 (final temperature 500 °C) on the porosity of resorcinol-formaldehyde based carbonaceous xerogels soft-templated with Pluronic F-127. We primarily utilized thermoporometry (differential scanning calorimetry technique) and, to a lesser extent, conventional nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C to analyze the porosity of the resulting carbons. Additionally, we examined the effects of particle size and the scale of the pyrolysis experiment, comparing a laboratory furnace with a thermal analyzer. At lower heating rates, particularly in a thermal analyzer, mesopores approximately 7–8 nm in size were observed. An increase in the heating rate resulted in larger mesopores, from 7 to 17 nm, widened pore size distribution (PSD), and a rise in mesopore volume from 0.21 to 0.53 cm3 g −1. Higher heating rates (> 5 K min-1) also accelerated the decomposition of the Pluronic F-127, leading to fast gas release, which subsequently caused cracking of the carbon skeleton and widening of the pores. Pyrolysis heating rate had no significant effect on the degree of graphitization in the pyrolyzed samples. Particle size showed minimal influence on porosity when xerogels were pyrolyzed at either the minimal or maximal heating rates in the thermal analyzer. However, experiments conducted in a laboratory furnace at the lowest heating rate demonstrated that imprecise temperature control and fluctuations can lead to the formation of larger mesopores.
