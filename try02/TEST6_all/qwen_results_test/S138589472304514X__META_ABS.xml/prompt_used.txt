You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient production of monocyclic aromatics from catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic with nitrogen-doped activated carbon catalyst Nitrogen-doped activated carbon catalysts (NAC) were prepared via a two-step process involving the co-carbonization of coconut shell and urea, followed by activation with KOH. These NAC were then employed in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of corn stover (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using a fixed bed reactor. The characterization results demonstrated that nitrogen doping led to a larger specific surface area, an enhanced microporous structure, and abundant nitrogen-containing functional groups, which facilitated the production of liquid and promoting the selectivity of monocyclic aromatics (MAHs). The introduced pyridinic-N and pyrrolitic-N provided sufficient active sites for deoxygenation, cracking, aromatization, and Diels-Alder reactions of co-pyrolysis vapors that augmented the formation of MAHs, as well as high calorific value syngas including H2, CH4, and C2+ hydrocarbons. The highest MAHs yield of 62.41% was achieved at a urea to coconut shell ratio of 0.8, whereas an excessive amount of urea resulted in cyclization and polymerization reactions of MAHs to form polycyclic aromatics (PAHs). Accordingly, controlling temperature and catalyst to raw material ratios enabled further regulation of the production and selectivity of MAHs. NAC with a better pore structure and more active sites exhibited excellent catalytic activity for value-added MAHs production in the co-pyrolysis of CS and HDPE, benefiting the resource utilization of organic solid waste with carbon-based catalysts.
