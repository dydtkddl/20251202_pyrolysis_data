Polymetallic MnW/Co3O4 porous composites derived from polyoxometalate-induced “cage-within-cage” zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with high efficiency towards NOx reduction Exploitation of highly active, economical and environmentally friendly catalysts is the primary imperative for addressing the pivotal concerns confronting NOx pollution. Transition metal oxides have shown good application prospects in NOx purification due to their plentiful availability and affordable pricing. Herein, a confinement-pyrolysis strategy for preparation of MnW/Co3O4 composites with porous structures and high dispersion of active components transformed from polyoxometalate (POM)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) was showcased. The strong interaction of Mn and Co contributes to the production of rich Mn3+ and Co3+ content (Mn4+ + Co2+ → Mn3+ + Co3+; Mn2+ + Co3+ → Mn3+ + Co2+). Compared with W/Co3O4, the Mn addition can increase the accessibility of active sites, induce more oxygen vacancies, acid sites and defects formation at the interfacial regions, promote the adsorption and activation of NH3 and NO, resulting in a 10–50 % higher NOx conversion at the 100−300 °C under 40,000 h−1. More encouragingly, experimental results suggested that the Mn-containing catalyst also exhibits much better tolerance against SO2, H2O, and HC than the Mn-free catalyst. This work demonstrates that guest@host POM@ZIF-functionalized derivative materials possess promising application perspective for low-temperature NOx reduction.
