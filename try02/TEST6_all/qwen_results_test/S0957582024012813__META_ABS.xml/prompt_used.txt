You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polymetallic MnW/Co3O4 porous composites derived from polyoxometalate-induced “cage-within-cage” zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with high efficiency towards NOx reduction Exploitation of highly active, economical and environmentally friendly catalysts is the primary imperative for addressing the pivotal concerns confronting NOx pollution. Transition metal oxides have shown good application prospects in NOx purification due to their plentiful availability and affordable pricing. Herein, a confinement-pyrolysis strategy for preparation of MnW/Co3O4 composites with porous structures and high dispersion of active components transformed from polyoxometalate (POM)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) was showcased. The strong interaction of Mn and Co contributes to the production of rich Mn3+ and Co3+ content (Mn4+ + Co2+ → Mn3+ + Co3+; Mn2+ + Co3+ → Mn3+ + Co2+). Compared with W/Co3O4, the Mn addition can increase the accessibility of active sites, induce more oxygen vacancies, acid sites and defects formation at the interfacial regions, promote the adsorption and activation of NH3 and NO, resulting in a 10–50 % higher NOx conversion at the 100−300 °C under 40,000 h−1. More encouragingly, experimental results suggested that the Mn-containing catalyst also exhibits much better tolerance against SO2, H2O, and HC than the Mn-free catalyst. This work demonstrates that guest@host POM@ZIF-functionalized derivative materials possess promising application perspective for low-temperature NOx reduction.
