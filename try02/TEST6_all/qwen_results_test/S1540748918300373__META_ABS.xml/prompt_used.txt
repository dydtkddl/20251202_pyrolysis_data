You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of dimethoxymethane and the reaction of dimethoxymethane with H atoms: A shock-tube/ARAS/TOF-MS and modeling study Dimethoxymethane (CH3OCH2OCH3, DMM) is the smallest oxymethylene ether and currently discussed as a promising alternative diesel fuel. For an adequate modeling of the DMM combustion chemistry, reliable kinetic parameters are needed. In the present work, shock-tube studies are presented on the kinetics of the DMM + H reaction (R1) and the kinetics of the unimolecular decomposition of DMM (R2). In the case of reaction (R1), ethyl iodide pyrolysis was used as H-atom source. For both reactions, rate coefficients were determined from H-atom concentration-time profiles monitored with atom resonance absorption spectroscopy (ARAS). The following overall rate coefficients were obtained: k 1(T) = (1.5 ± 0.7) × 1013 exp(− 1040 K/T) cm3 mol−1 s−1 (T = 850 − 1100 K, p ∼ 1.1 bar, bath gas: Ar) and k 2(T) = (6.2 ± 1.9) × 1013 exp(− 31830 K/T) s−1 (T = 1100 − 1550 K, p ∼ 1.1 bar, bath gas: Ar). Additionally, the pyrolysis of DMM was investigated in shock-tube experiments with high-repetition time-of-flight mass-spectrometric (TOF-MS) detection (T = 1100 − 1700 K, p = 0.9 − 1.3 bar, bath gas: Ne). Concentration-time profiles of DMM, CO, CH2O, C2H6, C2H4, and CH4 were recorded simultaneously. Both the ARAS and the TOF-MS profiles can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy by simulation with a recent DMM oxidation mechanism from the literature. Mechanistic aspects are elucidated and possible modifications are proposed and discussed.
