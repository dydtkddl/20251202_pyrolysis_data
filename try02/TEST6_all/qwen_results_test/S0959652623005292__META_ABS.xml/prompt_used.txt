You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-functional flame retardant coatings comprising chitosan/ gelatin and sodium phytate for rigid polyurethane foams In this work, a renewable multi-functional composite was fabricated from the combination of chitosan, gelatin and sodium phytate by a simple and eco-friendly process. The obtained products were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry. The above composites were then added onto the surface of rigid polyurethane foams by a rolling procedure. The flame performance test conducted by cone calorimeter demonstrated that the surface coating could effectively reduce the value of peak heat release rate and total heat release to 115.0 kW/m2 and 3.5 MJ/m2 from 247.2 kW/m2 and 6.8 MJ/m2 of the rigid polyurethane foams, respectively. Except for foams, the coating composite also exhibited high flame-retardant efficiency in wood, plastic and fiber. Through mechanism analysis (morphology observation by scanning electron microscopy, structural analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectra and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), it was suggested that the coating composite mainly took effect in condensed phase by the formation of physical barriers. Moreover, the newly prepared polyurethane foam composites also exhibited superior organic dye adsorption properties. This work provides an efficient, simple and eco-friendly route for large-scale production of multi-functional renewable materials that can be used in the fields of fire safety and environmental conservation.
