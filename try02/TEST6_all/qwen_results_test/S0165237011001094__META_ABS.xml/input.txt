Screening acidic zeolites for catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass and its components Zeolites have been shown to effectively promote cracking reactions during pyrolysis resulting in highly deoxygenated and hydrocarbon-rich compounds and stable pyrolysis oil product. Py/GC–MS was employed to study the catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass samples comprising oak, corn cob, corn stover, and switchgrass, as well as the fractional components of biomass, i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Quantitative values of condensable vapors and relative compositions of the pyrolytic products including non-condensable gases (NCG's) and solid residues are presented to show how reaction products are affected by catalyst choice. While all catalysts decreased the oxygen-containing products in the condensable vapors, H-ZSM-5 was most effective at producing aromatic hydrocarbons from the pyrolytic vapors. We demonstrated how the Si/Al ratio of the catalysts plays a role in the deoxygenation of the vapors towards the pathway to aromatic hydrocarbons.
