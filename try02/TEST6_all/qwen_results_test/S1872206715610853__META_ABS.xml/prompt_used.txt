You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in metal-free catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides The aim of “green chemistry” and “atom economy” is to utilize carbon dioxide and replace harmful reactants such as CO and phosgene for the production of cyclic carbonates. In this paper, metal-free catalysts including organic bases, ionic liquids, supported catalysts, organic copolymers and carbon materials for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates by the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to epoxides are reviewed. Recent advances in the design of the catalysts and the understanding of the reaction mechanism are summarized and discussed. The synergistic effects of organic bases and hydrogen bond donors, organic bases and nucleophilic anions, hydrogen bond donors and nucleophilic anions and active components and supports are highlighted. The challenge is to develop metal-free catalysts suitable for carbon dioxide capture and fixation. The ultimate goal is to synthesize cyclic carbonates in a flow reactor directly using carbon dioxide from industrial flue gas at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. By using synergetic effects, a multi-functional approach can meet the design strategy of metal-free catalysts for carbon dioxide adsorption and activation as well as epoxide ring opening.
