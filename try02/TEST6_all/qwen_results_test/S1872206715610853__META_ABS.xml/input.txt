Recent advances in metal-free catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides The aim of “green chemistry” and “atom economy” is to utilize carbon dioxide and replace harmful reactants such as CO and phosgene for the production of cyclic carbonates. In this paper, metal-free catalysts including organic bases, ionic liquids, supported catalysts, organic copolymers and carbon materials for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates by the cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to epoxides are reviewed. Recent advances in the design of the catalysts and the understanding of the reaction mechanism are summarized and discussed. The synergistic effects of organic bases and hydrogen bond donors, organic bases and nucleophilic anions, hydrogen bond donors and nucleophilic anions and active components and supports are highlighted. The challenge is to develop metal-free catalysts suitable for carbon dioxide capture and fixation. The ultimate goal is to synthesize cyclic carbonates in a flow reactor directly using carbon dioxide from industrial flue gas at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. By using synergetic effects, a multi-functional approach can meet the design strategy of metal-free catalysts for carbon dioxide adsorption and activation as well as epoxide ring opening.
