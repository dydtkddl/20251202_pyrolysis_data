Ultrasonic pretreatment effects on the co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste and paper sludge through orthogonal test In this study, the influences of ultrasonic pretreatment factors (frequency, power, treatment time) on blends of municipal solid waste (MSW) and paper sludge (PS) with additive (MgO) was explored, through orthogonal experiments design. The optimum operating condition wanted to be acquired. However, for the ultimate (H/C) and ash analysis after pretreatment, solid residue mass and oxygenates compounds contents in products, the influences of factors were in different results. With adding PS unceasingly, the contents of hydrocarbon compounds decreased. And the ultrasonic pretreatment had the obvious influence with high PS percentage. Longer treatment time resulted to the lower content of oxygenates compounds. After adding MgO, the residue mass reduced, which meant MgO had the catalytic action, and the oxygenates compounds content reduced only with 100 kHz, which had the sonochemical effect.
