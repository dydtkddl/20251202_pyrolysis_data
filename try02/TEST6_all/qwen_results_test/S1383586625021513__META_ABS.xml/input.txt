A novel Visbreaking-Supercritical Fluid extraction (SFE) strategy for efficient upgrading of vacuum residue: Experimental optimization and molecular dynamics insights The increasing demand for cleaner and more efficient refining processes has driven the development of advanced upgrading technologies for heavy crude residues. This study investigates a novel Visbreaking-Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) approach to upgrade the Merey vacuum residue (VR), integrating experimental analysis with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for atomic-level mechanism exploration. The Visbreaking process is optimized at 400 °C for 40 min, achieving a viscosity reduction of 89.0 % while minimizing coke formation. The SFE process fractionates the visbroken VR, with total extraction yields ranging from 70.1 wt% to 70.7 wt%, demonstrating remarkable efficiency. Higher extraction pressures enhance deasphalted oil (DAO) yield but compromise its quality with higher metal and sulfur contents, while lower temperatures improve extraction selectivity. The integrated process effectively removes Fe, Ni, V, and Na, with demetalization efficiencies exceeding 62 %, 75 %, and 95 %, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomic-scale insights into solubility mechanisms, revealing that higher pressures and lower temperatures enhance solvent compatibility with lighter visbroken VR fractions. The extracted DAO meets marine fuel oil blending specifications, while raffinates show potential for bitumen production and modification. These findings highlight the Visbreaking-SFE combination as a promising and sustainable upgrading strategy for heavy crude residues.
