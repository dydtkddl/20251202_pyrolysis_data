You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel Visbreaking-Supercritical Fluid extraction (SFE) strategy for efficient upgrading of vacuum residue: Experimental optimization and molecular dynamics insights The increasing demand for cleaner and more efficient refining processes has driven the development of advanced upgrading technologies for heavy crude residues. This study investigates a novel Visbreaking-Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) approach to upgrade the Merey vacuum residue (VR), integrating experimental analysis with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for atomic-level mechanism exploration. The Visbreaking process is optimized at 400 °C for 40 min, achieving a viscosity reduction of 89.0 % while minimizing coke formation. The SFE process fractionates the visbroken VR, with total extraction yields ranging from 70.1 wt% to 70.7 wt%, demonstrating remarkable efficiency. Higher extraction pressures enhance deasphalted oil (DAO) yield but compromise its quality with higher metal and sulfur contents, while lower temperatures improve extraction selectivity. The integrated process effectively removes Fe, Ni, V, and Na, with demetalization efficiencies exceeding 62 %, 75 %, and 95 %, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomic-scale insights into solubility mechanisms, revealing that higher pressures and lower temperatures enhance solvent compatibility with lighter visbroken VR fractions. The extracted DAO meets marine fuel oil blending specifications, while raffinates show potential for bitumen production and modification. These findings highlight the Visbreaking-SFE combination as a promising and sustainable upgrading strategy for heavy crude residues.
