You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The past to the current advances in the synthesis and applications of silica nanoparticles To deal with different important and updated applications like biomedical, pharmaceutical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, food, cosmetics, and even water purification, the synthetic approaches of solid silica nanoparticles (SSiNPs) and its porous variant mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSiNPs) become a matter of attention. The outstanding non-toxic nature and exceptional properties like bio-mobilizability, easy surface modifiability, stability, micro or meso pore structure, volume, and high surface area make them versatile contributors and potential candidates in human civilization. This review article comprises a brief summarization of the synthesis of SiNPs chemically as well as through a green approach along with its noteworthy characteristics in which it is clearly shown how the functional molecules change the particle size and shape for multiple purposes. This article mainly focuses greatly effective all conventional chemical and green approaches of both silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and MSiNPs (a total of 21 synthesis techniques). Also, the newly modified methods are cited in this review paper along with challenges and prospects. One of the most important discussions regarding sustainable, reliable, and eco-friendly (green) synthesis techniques and their available sources, advantages, and principles are mentioned in this paper. Finally, several relevant recent applications by many researchers are also noted with possible research in the industrial, chemical, agricultural, and biomedical life-related sectors. This review will help the researchers to gain the necessary information in perfect order which can be applied in the near future to invent and modify new methods on a bigger scale.
