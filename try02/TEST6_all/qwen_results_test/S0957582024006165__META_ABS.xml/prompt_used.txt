You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of enhanced gasoline-range fuel from catalytic pyrolysis of waste polypropylene: Effect of heating rate, temperature, and catalyst on reaction kinetics, products yield, and compositions The present study focuses on the recovery of superior-quality pyrolytic oil (PO) from the pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (WPP). The optimum heating rate, temperature and catalyst dosing were identified from experimental pyrolysis runs in a batch pyrolyzer. The thermal pyrolysis at 550 0C at 20 0C/min produced 83.5% PO, the maximum yield. The activated zeolite and kaolin catalyst prepared from the low-cost natural zeolite and kaolin clay were used for catalytic pyrolysis. The specific surface areas were determined to be 16.45 and 13.62 m2/g, with pore sizes 18.5 and 20.6 nm for zeolite and kaolin, respectively. The catalytic dosing of 12% zeolite and 10% kaolin was found to be the most optimum towards maximum PO yield. The FTIR and GC-MS analysis provided the qualitative and quantitative identification of various hydrocarbons (HCs) in PO. The HCs were classified as diesel-range (DHC) and gasoline-range (GHC) based on the carbon numbers. The catalyst zeolite and kaolin enhanced the yield of GHC components in PO by 6.45 and 7.7%, respectively. The catalyst considerably reduced the density, viscosity and improved the flash and pour points of PO. Finally, the reaction mechanism and reaction kinetics of pyrolysis reaction were determined from thermogravimetric data obtained under identical reaction conditions as in batch pyrolyzer. A shift of the reaction mechanism with lower activation energy was identified in the presence of a catalyst. The detailed characterization of gaseous products and solid residues were also performed.
