You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanofiltration as an effective tertiary treatment for the removal of micro- and nanoplastics from municipal water effluent The removal of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) from municipal wastewater is crucial to mitigate plastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems. This study demonstrates the effective use of nanofiltration (NF) with ceramic titanium dioxide (TiO2) membranes (1 kDa cut-off) for MNPs retention in the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant in Calabria, Italy. Operating at an optimized transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 6.5 bar and a feed flow rate of 80 L/h, the system achieved a high volume reduction factor (VRF) of 139, concentrating MNPs in the retentate and producing a contaminant-free permeate. Membrane fouling—mainly due to cake layer formation and pore-blocking mechanisms—led to permeate flux decline but was largely reversible. Sustainable operation was enabled by a cleaning protocol combining in-situ backwashing with permeate and ex-situ rinsing using hot distilled water (80 °C), without chemical additives, which restored up to 98 % of membrane permeability. Fouling behaviour, assessed using Hermia’s models, shifted from standard and complete pore blocking to cake layer formation, driven by the complex composition of municipal wastewater. These results highlight the viability of chemical-free ceramic membrane filtration for MNPs removal and support its integration into wastewater treatment plants as a sustainable strategy to reduce plastic emissions into natural water bodies.
