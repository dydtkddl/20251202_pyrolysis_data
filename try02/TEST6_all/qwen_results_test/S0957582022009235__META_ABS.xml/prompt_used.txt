You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of process parameters at direct liquefaction of waste PETs Waste polyethylene terephthalate (wPET) was converted to liquid fuel by direct liquefaction method. Additionally, how the catalyst (sodium borohydride) and microwave pre-treatment affect the total conversion and the char yield were investigated. Direct liquefaction experiments were carried out in a batch reactor under non-catalytic/catalytic conditions, and reaction temperature of 325–425 °C, and solid/solvent ratio of ¼, and reaction time of 15–90 min, and microwave pre-treatment time of 3–10 min, and an initial nitrogen pressure of 20 bar. Both the microwave pre-treatment and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) increased the total conversion in the direct liquefaction of wPETs. According to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of char samples obtained in the direct liquefaction process, the NaBH4 was converted to sodium borate (Na2B8O13). NaBH4 made both hydrogen (H) donating and catalytic effect. The highest total conversion in direct liquefaction of wPETs, which has at the reaction time of 30 min, and the reaction temperature of 400 °C, and in presence of NaBH4, and the microwave pre-treatment of 3 and 8 min, was 62%. The optimum process parameters in direct liquefaction of wPETs are the reaction time of 30 min, and reaction temperature of 400 °C, and the microwave pre-treatment time of 3 min.
