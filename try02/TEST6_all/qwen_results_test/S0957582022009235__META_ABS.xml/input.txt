Optimization of process parameters at direct liquefaction of waste PETs Waste polyethylene terephthalate (wPET) was converted to liquid fuel by direct liquefaction method. Additionally, how the catalyst (sodium borohydride) and microwave pre-treatment affect the total conversion and the char yield were investigated. Direct liquefaction experiments were carried out in a batch reactor under non-catalytic/catalytic conditions, and reaction temperature of 325–425 °C, and solid/solvent ratio of ¼, and reaction time of 15–90 min, and microwave pre-treatment time of 3–10 min, and an initial nitrogen pressure of 20 bar. Both the microwave pre-treatment and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) increased the total conversion in the direct liquefaction of wPETs. According to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of char samples obtained in the direct liquefaction process, the NaBH4 was converted to sodium borate (Na2B8O13). NaBH4 made both hydrogen (H) donating and catalytic effect. The highest total conversion in direct liquefaction of wPETs, which has at the reaction time of 30 min, and the reaction temperature of 400 °C, and in presence of NaBH4, and the microwave pre-treatment of 3 and 8 min, was 62%. The optimum process parameters in direct liquefaction of wPETs are the reaction time of 30 min, and reaction temperature of 400 °C, and the microwave pre-treatment time of 3 min.
