You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution of light olefins during the pyrolysis of polyethylene in a two-stage process The accumulation of waste plastics has been one of the most urgent and difficult environmental challenges. In this work, the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PyGC-MS), and a two-stage tube reactor. The pyrolysis behavior of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is compared, and there are almost no differences in the thermogravimetric curves obtained by TGA and the yield of gaseous products obtained in a two-stage process. The evolution of light olefins (C2–C4) during the pyrolysis of PE is investigated in a two-stage process with a constant condition in the first stage (500 °C) and various conditions in the second stage (700–1000 °C, 0.2–0.4 s). The temperature in the second stage has a more significant effect on the yield and selectivity of light olefins than the residence time, and the ethylene, propylene, and butene yields do not increase monotonously as the temperature rises. The highest yield of light olefins of 76.1 wt% is obtained at 800 °C with a selectivity of 91.7%. The maximum yields of ethylene, propylene, and butene are 45.1 wt%, 17.3 wt%, and 24.3 wt%, respectively. The scission mechanisms are proposed to provide insight into the process during which PE molecules transform into light olefins.
