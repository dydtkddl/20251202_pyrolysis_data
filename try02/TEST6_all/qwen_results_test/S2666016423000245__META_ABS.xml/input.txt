Performance of chemically modified Tripoli in catalytic pyrolysis of date kernels The use of natural minerals as catalysts in pyrolysis enhances the products’ yield and quality. However, natural minerals may lack the proper active sites to effectively catalyze the pyrolytic reactions. This paper addresses the performance of iron-chemically modified Jordanian Tripoli catalysts in the catalytic pyrolysis of date kernels. The Fe-chemically modified Tripoli catalyst was prepared by impregnation method at three different loadings (0.046, 1.788, 3.530 wt %). The effect of three different process variables, namely: pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and iron-loading on the performance of date kernels pyrolysis were investigated. Full factorial design methodology is employed to study the main effects of process variables and possible interaction effects among the process variables on the yields of the catalytic pyrolysis products. The maximum gas yield (197.8 ml/g-feed) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, heating rate of 20 °C/min and 3.530 wt% Fe-loading. The maximum bio-oil yield (42.88 wt%) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, heating rate of 60 °C/min and 1.788 wt% Fe-loading. The maximum bio-char yield (38.72 wt%) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, heating rate of 20 °C/min and catalytic pyrolysis using natural Tripoli. First order egression models are proposed to predict the product yields. The main implication of this study is that Fe-loaded Tripoli has effectively enhanced the quality of bio-oil.
