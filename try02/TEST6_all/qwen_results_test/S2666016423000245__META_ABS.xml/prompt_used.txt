You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance of chemically modified Tripoli in catalytic pyrolysis of date kernels The use of natural minerals as catalysts in pyrolysis enhances the products’ yield and quality. However, natural minerals may lack the proper active sites to effectively catalyze the pyrolytic reactions. This paper addresses the performance of iron-chemically modified Jordanian Tripoli catalysts in the catalytic pyrolysis of date kernels. The Fe-chemically modified Tripoli catalyst was prepared by impregnation method at three different loadings (0.046, 1.788, 3.530 wt %). The effect of three different process variables, namely: pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and iron-loading on the performance of date kernels pyrolysis were investigated. Full factorial design methodology is employed to study the main effects of process variables and possible interaction effects among the process variables on the yields of the catalytic pyrolysis products. The maximum gas yield (197.8 ml/g-feed) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C, heating rate of 20 °C/min and 3.530 wt% Fe-loading. The maximum bio-oil yield (42.88 wt%) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, heating rate of 60 °C/min and 1.788 wt% Fe-loading. The maximum bio-char yield (38.72 wt%) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C, heating rate of 20 °C/min and catalytic pyrolysis using natural Tripoli. First order egression models are proposed to predict the product yields. The main implication of this study is that Fe-loaded Tripoli has effectively enhanced the quality of bio-oil.
