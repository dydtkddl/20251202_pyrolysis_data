Exploring Carbon-based Materials as a tailored platform for Suzuki–Miyaura Coupling Reaction: A Review Carbon-based materials, such as activated carbon, graphene, graphitic carbon nitride, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and other carbonaceous derivatives, are being considered as a promising strategy for catalyst immobilization because of their exceptional characteristics, such as large surface area, tailored surface functionalities, and high chemical stability. Their use as catalyst support in Suzuki coupling reactions has made a significant contribution to enhancing catalytic durability, reusability, and reaction selectivity. Although the Suzuki Miyaura coupling reaction is an industrial established process, but significant research in academia is currently being conducted to enhance the substrate scope, developing more efficient catalysts, and improve its practicality. This review provides a thorough analysis of the application of carbon-based materials as catalyst supports in Suzuki coupling reactions between the years 2015–2023. The synthesis methodologies used to produce carbon-based support and the processes involved in the immobilization of Suzuki coupling catalysts onto the supports have been discussed, providing insight into the influence of these materials on catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and product yields. This review will provide insightful information to scientists and industry professionals to assist in directing future avenues for catalyst design and advance the development of more environmentally friendly and effective catalytic processes.
