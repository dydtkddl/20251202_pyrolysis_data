Solubility parameter of chitin and chitosan The solubility parameter of chitin and chitosan was determined by group contribution methods (GCM) and the values were compared with the values determined from maximum intrinsic viscosity, surface tension, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter and dielectric constant values. The values, thus, obtained were confirmed by values obtained from GCM. The solubility parameters of chitosan determined by these methods are more or less equal and the average is approximately 41 J1/2/cm 3/2. A method for estimating the overall solubility parameter of chitosan having any degree of deacetylation is proposed.
