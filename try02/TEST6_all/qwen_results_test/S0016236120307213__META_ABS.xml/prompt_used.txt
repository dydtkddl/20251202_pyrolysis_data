You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of polyethylene waste into clean fuels and waxes via hydrothermal processing (HTP) The exponential growth of plastic production and a low recycling rate (<9%) over the last 60 years have resulted in vast plastic waste accumulation in landfills and the environment. About 40% of the 350 million tons of global plastic waste generated in 2015 was polyethylene (PE). Converting PE waste into useful products can help reduce PE waste accumulation. Hydrothermal processing (HTP) of PE into oils was studied previously; however, comprehensive reaction pathways were not reported, and the products were not evaluated for potential fuel and wax applications. In this study, various PE wastes were converted via HTP at 425–450 °C for reaction times of 0.5–4 h into clean waxes or ultra-low sulfur fuels. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) and FTIR were used for determining the chemical compositions of the products. A mixture of paraffin and α-olefin waxes was obtained with a high yield, 97 wt. %, at 425 °C and 30 min. The highest oil yield, 87 wt. %, for producing fuels was obtained at 425 °C and 2.5 h. The diesel fraction (HTP diesel) met all requirements for No. 1-D ultra-low sulfur diesel and had a high cetane number of 61 and a low aromatic content of 18 vol. %. Mixtures up to 50 vol. % of HTP diesel in commercial diesel also met all requirements for No. 2-D ultra-low sulfur diesel. Comprehensive reaction pathways for PE conversion were inferred from detailed GC×GC analyses of reaction intermediates. The HTP method is more energy-efficient and has lower greenhouse gas emissions than incineration and pyrolysis, and is a promising method for reducing PE waste accumulation.
