Value addition of rice straw cellulose fibers as a reinforcer in packaging applications The potential use of agro-waste in food packaging applications is receiving remarkable attention due to its sustainable approach and biodegradable properties. As typical lignocellulosic biomass, rice straw (RS) is widely produced but is usually abandoned and burned, causing tremendous environmental concerns. The exploration of using RS as the source of biodegradable packaging materials is promising for economically converting this agricultural waste into packaging material, thereby providing a considerable solution for RS disposal and an alternative solution to synthetic plastic waste. Polymers have been infused with nanoparticles, fibers, and whiskers, along with plasticizers and cross-linkers, and fillers like nanoparticles and fibers. They have also been blended with natural extracts, essential oils, and other synthetic and natural polymers to improve RS properties. There is still much research to be done before this biopolymer can be applied at an industrial level in food packaging. In this respect, RS can be valued for packaging to add value to these underutilized residues. This review article focuses on the extraction methods and functionality of cellulose fibers and their nanostructured forms from RS and their utilization in packaging applications.
