You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Resource recovery from synthetic polymers via microwave pyrolysis using different susceptors In this study, microwave assisted pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) was conducted, and the effects of microwave power, susceptor type, and PP to susceptor ratio on (i) temperature and heating rate profiles, (ii) overall oil, gas and char yields, (iii) composition of oil and gas, and (iv) heating value of oil, were evaluated. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a multimode microwave reactor equipped with accurate temperature monitoring system. The individual constituents in oil and gaseous fractions were analyzed using gas chromatograph equipped with mass spectrometer and flame ionization detectors. Six different microwave susceptors such as graphite, aluminum, silicon carbide, activated carbon, lignin and fly ash were utilized. At optimal conditions of 450W microwave power and 100:1wt./wt. of PP (5g):graphite, nearly 48wt.% of oil with heating value of 44.45MJkg−1 was obtained along with 50wt.% of C3–C6 gaseous hydrocarbons. The scalability of the process was evaluated by pyrolyzing 50g of PP under the above conditions, which resulted in 83% energy recovery in the oil. While alkenes and cycloalkanes constituted a major fraction in the oil, their relative yields varied significantly with different susceptors suggesting that the susceptors also acted as catalysts and interacted with the polymer besides transferring the incident microwave energy. The applicability of the technique was also demonstrated for pyrolysis of commercial polyethylenes and polyisoprene.
