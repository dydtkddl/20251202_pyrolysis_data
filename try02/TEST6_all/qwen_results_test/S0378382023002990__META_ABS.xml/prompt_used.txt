You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fuel production from liquefaction of polypropylene in n-hexane solvent The excessive generation of plastic waste has become a major threat to the environment. Petroleum-based plastics, however, provided the opportunity for its re-conversion into fuel oil. In this study, polypropylene plastic was liquefied to produce liquid fuels in the presence of n-hexane solvent. The study was performed in a batch reactor at temperatures between 350 and 400 °C, reaction times between 0 and 150 min, and solvent-to-plastic mass ratios between 0:1–5:1. The effect of the different parameters was evaluated based on its yield amount and fuel quality. The results showed that the highest oil yield of 88.2 wt% was obtained at a temperature of 400 °C. A comparable oil yield of 88.0 wt% was also obtained at 150 min reaction time. The characterization results showed that the oil had density, viscosity and calorific value similar to the conventional gasoline. The GC–MS analysis showed that the oil was dominated by alkanes, alkenes and alcohol compounds with carbon numbers C6-C20, which is within the range of gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel. In addition, the production of oil from the liquefaction of plastic could serve as an alternative source to the depleting fuel as well as increase the value of plastics, leading to fewer environmental problems caused by plastic waste.
