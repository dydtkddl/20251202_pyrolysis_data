You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Role of operating conditions in the catalyst deactivation in the in-line steam reforming of volatiles from biomass fast pyrolysis The effect of reforming conditions (temperature, space time and steam/biomass ratio (S/B)) has been studied in the continuous biomass pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming process in order to establish suitable conditions for attenuating the deactivation of a commercial Ni catalyst by coke deposition. The experiments have been performed in a conical spouted bed and a fluidized bed reactor for the pyrolysis and reforming steps, respectively. Biomass fast pyrolysis was performed at 500 °C and the reforming operating conditions studied are as follows: 550–700 °C; space time, 10–30 gcat min gvolatiles −1, and; S/B ratio, 2–5. The coke deposited on the catalyst has been analyzed by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), and two types of coke have been identified, i.e., the coke deposited on the Ni active sites and the one separated from these sites, without filamentous coke being observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Coke deposition has been related to the decomposition of the oxygenates derived from biomass pyrolysis and the re-polymerization of phenolic oxygenates. Suitable conditions to achieve almost full conversion with a H2 yield of up to 95% and stability for 160 min on stream, are as follows: 600 °C, space time of 30 gcat min gvolatiles −1 and S/B ratio of 3.
