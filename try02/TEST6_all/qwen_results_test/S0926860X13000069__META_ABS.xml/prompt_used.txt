You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Benzene reduction in gasoline by alkylation with propylene over MCM-22 zeolite with a different Brønsted/Lewis acidity ratios In this work, the liquid phase alkylation of benzene with propylene was carried out over MCM-22 zeolite treated thermally in a flow of air and nitrogen for activation. Such activation procedures led to changes in the Brønsted/Lewis acidity ratio of the samples, but not in textural properties. The alkylation reaction was conducted using as a feed a benzene-enriched sample of reformate heart cut containing ca. 20wt% benzene. The experimental reaction was performed in a batch reactor at 220°C adjusting the amount of propylene for a molar ratio of benzene to propylene in the feed of 2. Benzene conversion versus time profiles consisted of three regions wherein (i) the aromatic conversion decreased very slightly, (ii) it diminished drastically, and (iii) it continued dropping with time, but to a lesser extent than in (ii). MCM-22 sample containing a higher Brønsted acidity exhibited a larger resistance to deactivation during benzene alkylation experiments, as severe deactivation starts after 19h of time on stream. Concerning products distribution, the presence of bulky (poly) alkylated products declined as the MCM-22 became more deactivated.
