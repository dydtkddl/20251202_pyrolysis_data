You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and plastic mixtures using HZSM-5 The catalytic effect of HZSM-5 zeolite was studied on the thermal decomposition of model waste mixtures of plastics (composed of PE, PP, and PET) and biomass (composed of newspaper, cardboard, and pine sawdust). The influence of temperature and catalyst ratio as well as the hindering effect of cellulose and lignin on the catalytic decomposition of plastic waste were studied applying analytical pyrolysis at low and high heating rate by thermogravimetry/mass spectrometry (TG/MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), respectively. The products of laboratory scale batch pyrolysis and thermo-catalytic pyrolysis were analyzed in details and compared. HZSM-5 catalyst reduced the thermal stability of plastic waste, but the catalytic effect was blocked when 50% cellulose or 10% lignin were mixed in the plastic waste. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to reveal correlations between the composition of pyrolysis products, pyrolysis temperature and proportion of the applied catalyst. It was established that the hindering effect of biomass could be compensated by applying higher catalyst ratio. In a batch reactor, the use of HZSM-5 catalyst led to a significant increase in the yields of volatiles (both gases and pyrolysis oil); moreover aromatization or isomerization effects have been observed. Aromatic compounds were produced to a reduced extent by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of biomass-containing plastic waste compared to that of plastic waste indicating that the cellulose and lignin components of the waste lower the HZSM-5 catalyst activity.
