Porous materials for capture and catalytic conversion of CO2 at low concentration Carbon accumulation has raised worldwide concerns due to the risks of climate change. In such cases, direct carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and conversion from diluted sources has potential for negative carbon emission. Distinct from non-porous catalytic systems, the fascinating features of large specific surface area, highly exposed catalytic sites, varied structures and tunable functions make porous materials attractive candidates for integrating the process of capture and utilization of diluted CO2. In this review, we firstly provide a brief overview of the recent developments of porous materials, including zeolites, metal–organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, porous carbon, and functionalized mesoporous materials and their applications for CO2 adsorption at relatively low partial pressure. Afterwards, direct chemical transformation of diluted CO2 over different porous catalysts is discussed with the emphasis of their diverse functional roles. This is followed by a brief summary of current challenges and our personal view on future directions of this field.
