Fast pyrolysis kinetics of alkali lignin: Evaluation of apparent rate parameters and product time evolution In this study, the apparent kinetics of fast pyrolysis of alkali lignin was evaluated by obtaining isothermal mass loss data in the timescale of 2–30s at 400–700°C in an analytical pyrolyzer. The data were analyzed using different reaction models to determine the rate constants and apparent rate parameters. First order and one dimensional diffusion models resulted in good fits with experimental data with apparent activation energy of 23kJmol−1. Kinetic compensation effect was established using a large number of kinetic parameters reported in the literature for pyrolysis of different lignins. The time evolution of the major functional groups in the pyrolysate was analyzed using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Maximum production of the volatiles occurred around 10–12s. A clear transformation of guaiacols to phenol, catechol and their derivatives, and aromatic hydrocarbons was observed with increasing temperature. The plausible reaction steps involved in various transformations are discussed.
