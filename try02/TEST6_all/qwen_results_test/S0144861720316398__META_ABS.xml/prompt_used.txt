You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal stability of starch bionanocomposites films: Exploring the role of esterified cellulose nanofibers isolated from crop residue Thermal stability and degradation kinetics were studied for glycerol plasticized starch (GPS) nanocomposites reinforced with cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) extracted from wheat straw, a crop residue. To assess the effect of surface modifications on CNFs in improving thermal degradation behavior, three types of CNFs were used viz pristine (p-CNFs), esterified (m-CNFs) and a mixture of pristine and esterified (x-CNFs) in equal ratio. Three kinetics models Ozawa-Flynn, Freidman and Kissinger’s were used to evaluate activation energy of thermal degradation for pristine and nanocomposite samples. Properties like morphology, crystallinity and water vapor permeability (WVP) were also evaluated. Morphology of m-CNF/GPS bionanocomposites films was superior as compared to other films with better interfacial bonding. Moreover, m-CNFs also exhibited 81 % reduction WVP as compared to pristine GPS films. Activation energy revealed significant enhancement i.e. as high as 52 % in thermal stability with addition of CNFs. Consequent relation between morphology and thermal stability was also established.
