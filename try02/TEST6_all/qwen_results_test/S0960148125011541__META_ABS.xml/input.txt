An experimental assessment of combustion and emission characteristics of compression ignition engine fuelled with microemulsion of pine needle pyrolysis oil and diesel This study investigates the combustion and emission characteristics of a compression ignition (CI) engine fuelled with a micro-emulsion blend of pine needle pyrolysis oil (PNPO) and diesel. The PNPO blends performed well, achieving comparable engine performance to regular diesel while significantly reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, a major greenhouse gas. There was a slight increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) emissions, but overall, the results were promising. An optimal blend containing 18.24 % PNPO was identified that could replace up to 25 % of conventional diesel fuel with minimal engine modifications. This blend maintained good engine efficiency and reduced NOx emissions, suggesting PNPO has potential as a sustainable renewable fuel source for diesel engines.
