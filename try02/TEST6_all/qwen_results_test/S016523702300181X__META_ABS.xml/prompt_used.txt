You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of mixed plastic fractions – Development of predictive models for yield and oil quality Pyrolysis of plastic mixtures has shown to form complex mixtures of oil, which is difficult to predict. Interaction effects between plastics have shown to affect both the oil composition and the yield distribution of oil, char, and gas. This work aims to generate models for the prediction of oil and char yield, acid number, and viscosity based on the feed composition. Besides the oil composition based on the reactor feed was mapped. Pyrolysis was performed in a batch reactor with a mixture of PP, PE, EVA, PET, PS and PA, where the content of PET, PS and PA were varied from 0% to 15%. The developed models showed a decrease in oil yield of 10% when 15% PS was interchanged with PET. Char content, acid number, and viscosity were shown to increase with the content of PET and lowered with the content of PS. PA caused an increase in char yield and viscosity, while it did not affect the acid number. The models R2-values varied from 0.87 to 0.96, showing that most of the variation in the responses can be explained by the differences in feed composition. The oil composition was found to mainly consist of hydrocarbons (C10 +), naphta and aromatics with only a small precense of alcohol and acid. The content of aromatic hydrocarbons is increased by the presence of PS, due to formation of styrene and toluene while the acid content increases with the PET content.
