You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pelletization of metal-organic framework gel for high arsenic removal in natural gas condensate The practical deployment of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is often limited by their poor processability and difficulty in forming robust macrostructures. In this study, we report a microwave-assisted, one-pot synthesis of processable UiO-66 gel (PU66-G) using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste as a precursor. PU66-G exhibited a high specific BET surface area of 1225 m2 g−1 and an increased defect density at Zr6 nodes, significantly contributing to its superior arsenic adsorption capacities of 214.1 mg g−1 for As(III) and 312.7 mg g−1 for As(V). Notably, the unique rheological properties of PU66-G facilitate its transformation into binder-free pellets with excellent mechanical stability. These pellets achieved 93.35 % arsenic removal efficiency in real natural gas condensates, with only minimal performance loss compared to the powder form (96.43 %). Moreover, the pellets demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining 88.29 % removal efficiency after 20 operating cycles with noticeable structural degradation. By simultaneously addressing the processability limitations of UiO-66 and the valorization of PET waste, this study establishes PU66-G as a scalable and high-performance adsorbent for arsenic decontamination nonpolar systems.
