Pelletization of metal-organic framework gel for high arsenic removal in natural gas condensate The practical deployment of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is often limited by their poor processability and difficulty in forming robust macrostructures. In this study, we report a microwave-assisted, one-pot synthesis of processable UiO-66 gel (PU66-G) using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste as a precursor. PU66-G exhibited a high specific BET surface area of 1225 m2 g−1 and an increased defect density at Zr6 nodes, significantly contributing to its superior arsenic adsorption capacities of 214.1 mg g−1 for As(III) and 312.7 mg g−1 for As(V). Notably, the unique rheological properties of PU66-G facilitate its transformation into binder-free pellets with excellent mechanical stability. These pellets achieved 93.35 % arsenic removal efficiency in real natural gas condensates, with only minimal performance loss compared to the powder form (96.43 %). Moreover, the pellets demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining 88.29 % removal efficiency after 20 operating cycles with noticeable structural degradation. By simultaneously addressing the processability limitations of UiO-66 and the valorization of PET waste, this study establishes PU66-G as a scalable and high-performance adsorbent for arsenic decontamination nonpolar systems.
