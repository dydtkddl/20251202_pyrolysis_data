You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Storage stability of biocrude oils from fast pyrolysis of poultry litter The unstable nature of biocrude oils produced from conventional pyrolysis of biomass is one of the properties that limits its application. In the disposal of poultry litter via pyrolysis technology, the biocrude oil produced as a value-added product can be used for on farm applications. In this study, we investigated the influence of bedding material (wood shavings) on the storage stability of biocrude oils produced from the fast pyrolysis of poultry litter. The biocrude oils produced from manure, wood (pine and oak), and mixtures of manure and wood in proportions (75:25 50:50, and 25:75w/w%) were stored under ambient conditions in sealed glass vials for a period of 6months and their stability were monitored by measuring the changes in viscosity over time. The manure oil had the lowest rate of viscosity change and thus was relatively the most stable and the oils from the 50:50w/w% litter mixtures were the least stable. The rate of viscosity change of the manure biocrude oil was 1.33cP/day and that of the 50/50 litter mixture was 7.6cP/day for pine and 4.17cP/day for oak. The spectrometric analyses of the biocrude oils showed that the presence of highly reactive oxygenated functionalities in the oil were responsible for the instability characteristic of the litter biocrude oils. The poor stability of the biocrude oil from the 50:50w/w% litter mixtures was attributed to reactions between nitrogenous compounds (amides) from protein degradation and oxygenated compounds from the decomposition of polysaccharides and lignin. The addition of 10% methanol and 10% ethanol to the oil from 50% manure and 50% pine reduced the initial viscosity of the oil and was also beneficial in slowing down the rate of viscosity change during storage.
