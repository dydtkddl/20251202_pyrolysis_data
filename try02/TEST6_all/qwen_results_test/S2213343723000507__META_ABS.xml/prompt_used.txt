You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen and valuable liquid fuel production from the in-situ pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming reactions of cellulose bio-polymer wastes dissolved in phenol over trimetallic Ni-La-Pd/TiCa nanocatalysts Hydrogen and liquid fuel production from biopolymer waste, such as cellulose dissolved in phenol, was investigated using in-situ pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming conditions. Developing a sustainable method for the thermal cracking of such biopolymers still faces difficulties due to the catalyst stability primarily impacted by coke deposition. The key to the proposed method is improving a highly active and stable catalytic reforming process in which trimetallic Ni-La-Pd supported on TiCa acts as a primary reforming catalyst. Catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal, and impregnation techniques, and the physicochemical characteristics of the fresh and spent materials were examined. The results showed that the NLP/TiCa catalysts performed effectively due to their comparatively high surface area, strong basicity, evenly distributed Pd particles, and appropriate redox and desorption characteristics. The addition of Pd retards the reducibility of the NL/TiCa; therefore, a Pd*La, La*Ni, La*Ti, and Ca*Ti interaction exist. Almost complete conversion of phenol (98.7%) and maximum H2 yield (99.6%) were achieved at 800 °C for the NLP/TiCa. These findings give an insight into industrial-scale development. They have significant potential for enhancing the generation of hydrogen and liquid products from phenol and cellulose waste, such as propanol, ethanol, toluene, etc.
