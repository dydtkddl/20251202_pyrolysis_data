You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Post-modification of polyoxanorbornene via sequential “click” reactions for the preparation of flame retardant polymers Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is a widely applicable method for synthesizing different macromolecular structures due to the diversity of functional groups, and the ROMP system has been widely studied in the literature for the preparation of flame retardant polyoxanorbonene (PONB) derivatives. This work aims to synthesize α-bromo ester functional PONB followed by grafting phosphorus groups by orthogonally sequential “click” reactions onto those PONBs. Thus, phosphorus groups incorporated covalently to the side chain and main chains of PONB by nucleophilic thio-bromo and radical thiol-ene “click” reactions, respectively. The effect of phosphorus content in the synthesized polymers on the thermal stability and decomposition properties was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA tests revealed that char yield increases when phosphorus content increases, illustrating an efficient flame retardancy effect. The heat release peak value of polymers was decreased with increasing phosphorus groups from 67.60 W/g to 47.24 and 43.40 W/g by microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC) measurement, respectively. Additionally, vertical and horizontal burning tests were conducted to determine whether phosphorus-containing PONBs have flame-retardant or self-extinguishing properties. According to the burning tests of polymer solutions-impregnated filter papers, it was noted that phosphorous-containing polymers showed slow ignition and self-extinguishing behavior.
