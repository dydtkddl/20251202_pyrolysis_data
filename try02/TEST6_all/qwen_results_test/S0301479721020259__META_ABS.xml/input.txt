Hydrogen production technologies - Membrane based separation, storage and challenges The production of hydrogen, its separation, and storage for use as a primary source of energy is an important component of the green energy economy of the world. Hydrogen is a potential non-carbon-based energy source, which is gradually replacing the dependency on fossil fuels. It is anticipated that as the alternative fuel since hydrogen can be produced from green and clean sources. The evolution of hydrogen from renewable and non-renewable sources by various technologies has now gained tremendous research and industrial interest. The most appropriate methods for hydrogen generation involve the direct conversion of solar energy, exploitation of solar and wind energy for the electrolysis of water, besides conversion of fuel and biomass. To produce cleaner hydrogen and its separation from the chemical impurities is crucial and several methods including photobiological, photoelectrochemical, electrochemical, photocatalytic, thermochemical, thermolysis, and steam gasification have been used. The diverse types of membranes along with the pressure gas swing adsorption technique is another technique used to separate hydrogen, but the storage of hydrogen in an inexpensive, safe, compact, and environmentally friendly manner is one of the major concerns contributing to the country's economy. Apart from the countless advantages, storage and handling of hydrogen is a serious concern. Owing to its high inflammability, enough safety measures should be adopted during its production and storage as a fuel. It is necessary to provide information regarding the production technologies, storage, and separation methods of hydrogen and the present review addresses these issues.
