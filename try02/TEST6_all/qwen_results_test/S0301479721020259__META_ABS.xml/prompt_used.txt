You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production technologies - Membrane based separation, storage and challenges The production of hydrogen, its separation, and storage for use as a primary source of energy is an important component of the green energy economy of the world. Hydrogen is a potential non-carbon-based energy source, which is gradually replacing the dependency on fossil fuels. It is anticipated that as the alternative fuel since hydrogen can be produced from green and clean sources. The evolution of hydrogen from renewable and non-renewable sources by various technologies has now gained tremendous research and industrial interest. The most appropriate methods for hydrogen generation involve the direct conversion of solar energy, exploitation of solar and wind energy for the electrolysis of water, besides conversion of fuel and biomass. To produce cleaner hydrogen and its separation from the chemical impurities is crucial and several methods including photobiological, photoelectrochemical, electrochemical, photocatalytic, thermochemical, thermolysis, and steam gasification have been used. The diverse types of membranes along with the pressure gas swing adsorption technique is another technique used to separate hydrogen, but the storage of hydrogen in an inexpensive, safe, compact, and environmentally friendly manner is one of the major concerns contributing to the country's economy. Apart from the countless advantages, storage and handling of hydrogen is a serious concern. Owing to its high inflammability, enough safety measures should be adopted during its production and storage as a fuel. It is necessary to provide information regarding the production technologies, storage, and separation methods of hydrogen and the present review addresses these issues.
