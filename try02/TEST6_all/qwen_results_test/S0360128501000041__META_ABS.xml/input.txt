Combustion of pulverised coal and biomass This review paper is concerned with the current status of the understanding of the combustion of pulverised coal and pulverised biomass from the viewpoint of computer modelling. Whilst a knowledge of the underpinning science is of vital importance it's translation into applicable computer useable equations or computer data base libraries is of vital importance. A review is given of the current status of sub-models for the combustion of pulverised coal. Much of the information available for coal is transferable to biomass combustion although there are still areas where there is a lack of information.
