You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of electromagnetic and acoustic irradiation in enhancing heterogeneous catalytic reactions Process intensification has become a very interesting approach, transforming current practices in chemical engineering and bringing forth new developments in equipment, processing techniques and operational methods. This development aims at more compact, safe, energy efficient and environmentally friendly process. Several unconventional processing techniques rely on alternative forms of energy. Chemistry under extreme and non-conventional conditions is an actively studied topic in applied research and industry. Alternatives to conventional synthetic procedures promise enhancement of reaction rates, yields, selectivity and also bear promise of milder reaction conditions in chemical synthesis. During the last few decades, chemical application of ultrasound (US) and microwave (MW) irradiation has received a lot of attention and widespread research is going on in these areas. Significant enhancement of selectivities, rates and yields in chemical reactions has been achieved by means of US and MW irradiation. The popularity of US and MW irradiation as chemical laboratory techniques is rapidly growing, based on the number of publications, presentations and meetings, demonstrating their vast potential. Other less exploited methods are solar and plasma reactors. These, however, will not be touched in the present review, which focuses on the use of ultrasound and microwaves as sources of energy, mainly in catalytic applications.
