You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Status of the EU DEMO breeding blanket manufacturing R&D activities The realization of a DEMOnstration Fusion Power Reactor (DEMO) to follow ITER, with the capability of generating several hundred MW of net electricity and operating with a closed fuel-cycle by 2050, is viewed by Europe as the remaining crucial step towards the exploitation of fusion power. The EUROfusion Consortium, in the frame of the European Horizon 2020 Program, has been assessing four different breeding blanket concepts in view of selecting the reference one for DEMO. This paper describes technologies and manufacturing scenarios developed and envisaged for the four blanket concepts, including nuclear “conventional” assembly processes as GTAW, electron beam and laser welding, Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), and also more advanced (from the nuclear standpoint) technologies as additive manufacturing techniques. These developments are performed in conformity with international standards and/or design/manufacturing codes. Topics as the metallurgical weldability of EUROFER steel and the associated risks or the development of appropriate filler wire are discussed. The development of protective W-coating layers on First Wall, with Functionally Graded (FG) interlayer as compliance layer between W and EUROFER substrate, realized by Vacuum Plasma Spraying method, is also propounded. First layer systems showed promising layer adhesion, thermal fatigue and thermal shock properties. He-cooled mock-ups, representative of the First Wall with FG W/EUROFER coating are developed for test campaigns in the HELOKA facility under relevant heat fluxes. First elements of Double Walled Tubes (DWT) manufacturing and tube/plate assembly for the water cooled concept are given, comprising test campaign aiming at assessing their behaviour under corrosion. In addition, further development strategies are suggested.
