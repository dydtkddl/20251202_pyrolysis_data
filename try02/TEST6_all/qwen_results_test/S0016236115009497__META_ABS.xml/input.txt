Investigations on the thermal decomposition of JP-10/iso-octane binary mixtures To mainly investigate the initiation effect of iso-octane as an activation component on the binary model fuels of JP-10/iso-octane, the thermal decomposition of JP-10, iso-octane and their mixtures has been performed in a stainless-steel tubular reactor at the temperatures from 883K to 963K. The conversions of components, and the yields of gas and liquid products for each sample are determined in detail. The addition of iso-octane can promote the decomposition of JP-10, and the initiation (of JP-10)-inhibition (of iso-octane) effects can be observed during the decomposition processes of JP-10/iso-octane mixtures. One possible mechanism has been proposed to demonstrate the initiation effect of iso-octane on the decomposition of JP-10. For the possible pathways, the rate constants of the H-abstraction reactions between the alkyl radicals obtained from CC bond fission of iso-octane and the H atoms of JP-10 are calculated from the density functional theory (DFT). In combination with the quantum calculations and experimental observations, the formation of some decomposition products in the JP-10/iso-octane mixtures can be reasonably illustrated.
