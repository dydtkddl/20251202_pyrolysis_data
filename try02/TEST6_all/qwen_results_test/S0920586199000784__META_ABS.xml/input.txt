Modelling of catalytic gas–solid fluidised bed reactors Flow regimes in gas–solid fluidisation are presented on a broad scale from captive smooth fluidisation to dilute transport. The parameters useful to identify each transition are critically presented. The description of catalytic gas–solid fluidised beds is considered starting from simplified two-phase models; a third phase given by clouds and wakes is then introduced to justify their effect in promoting solids circulation. Different hydrodynamic features have been used in the literature to describe the dense and the dilute phase, according to the mixing effect of bubbles. Circulating fluidised bed modelling is approached according to the definition of a hydrodynamic regime. The numerous models appearing up to now in literature are presented, from earlier homogeneous models to the latest continuous radial profile and clustering models. The development of spouted beds as chemical reactors is given from the first fundamental approach, followed by the experimentation in the late 1970s, ending with more complex descriptions that take into account all the spouted bed zones. A concluding chapter on model selection offers general criteria to tackle the mathematical description which predicts the performance of catalytic reactors in the different regimes.
