Evaluation of optical and thermal properties of benzylcyanocoumarin and its application in NIR reflective black coatings for automotive LiDAR detection The LiDAR detection performance of autonomous vehicles is highly influenced by the optical properties of exterior coatings. In this study, a bilayered black coating system, consisting of an organic dye coating and a white reflective coating, was designed to maintain a visually black appearance while achieving high near-infrared reflectance. Benzylcyanocoumarin derivative dyes were synthesized and blended with the highly durable PB15 pigment to fabricate black coatings. The resulting films exhibited a reflectance below 5 % in the visible range, while achieving reflectance values of at least 67.8 % and 48.8 % at the primary LiDAR wavelengths of 905 nm and 1550 nm, respectively—representing up to an eightfold improvement in detection performance compared to conventional carbon black coatings. This enhancement was also accompanied by a significant NIR photothermal blocking effect which can reduce the vehicle interior temperature. The photophysical properties of the dyes varied depending on the amine substituent structure, as confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Among the tested coatings, Dm-Black and De-Black both maintained a color-difference below 1 after 216 h of UV irradiation, demonstrating high photostability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of stable, dye-based black coatings for autonomous vehicle LiDAR detection. It also offers potential to reduce heat accumulation on vehicle exteriors, thereby contributing to energy savings and improved thermal management.
