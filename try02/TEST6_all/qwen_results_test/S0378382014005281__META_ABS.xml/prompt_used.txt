You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of polypropylene on the pyrolysis of flame retarded high impact polystyrene Pyrolysis of high impact polystyrene (HIPS), containing decabromodiphenyl oxide as brominated flame retardant (BFR) with Sb2O3 as a synergist (Br–Sb–HIPS), often leads to high concentrations of toxic brominated organic compounds in the pyrolysis oils which would detrimentally impact the reuse of these pyrolysis oils. In this work, the pyrolysis of Br–Sb–HIPS in the presence of polypropylene (PP) at different blending mass ratios using a fixed bed reactor at 410°C was performed to investigate what the effect of PP has on the pyrolysis of Br–Sb–HIPS. The thermal decomposition characterization of Br–Sb–HIPS and PP was investigated using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The pyrolysis oils were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). TGA revealed that there was a synergistic interaction between Br–Sb–HIPS and PP during co-pyrolysis process. More wax/oil and less gas were produced and the yields of toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene and many other compounds in the pyrolysis oil reversely increased in the presence of PP. Moreover, PP was found to be effective to reduce bromine in the pyrolysis oil. When 30wt.% PP was blended into Br–Sb–HIPS, it could reduce the amount of bromine in pyrolysis oil to 38% of the original value.
