Phase behavior in heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation of oils in supercritical fluids Conventional catalytic hydrogenation of oils is essentially constrained by mass-transfer resistance because of the poor solubility of hydrogen in liquid-phase substrates. Supercritical fluids (SCFs) offer a solution by creating a single, homogeneous reaction medium that dissolves both hydrogen and high-molecular-weight oils, thus overcoming the interfacial transport limitations. This review synthesizes several research to establish a unified framework for the supercritical hydrogenation of different feedstocks, including heavy oils, vegetable oils, and emerging streams like bio- and plastic-derived pyrolysis oils. The central goal of this work is to provide a deep understanding of phase behavior which is a critical aspect of the process design, directly influencing reaction rates, selectivity, and overall efficiency. By integrating principles of thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, catalysis selection, and reactor design, this review provides applicable design metrics for developing a more suitable upgrading technology with higher space yield times for a wide spectrum of complex oils.
