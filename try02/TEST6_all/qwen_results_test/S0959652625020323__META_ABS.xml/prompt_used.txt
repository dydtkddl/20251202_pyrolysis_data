You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Scalable biochar production from oil palm fronds and waste cooking oil: Techno-economic and policy-oriented evaluation for rural deployment The increasing demand for sustainable biomass utilization and decentralized energy solutions has highlighted the need for low-cost biochar systems in rural areas. This study assesses the techno-economic feasibility of producing premium biochar from oil palm fronds (OPF) and waste cooking oil (WCO) through acid pretreatment and co-torrefaction in a 300-kg batch system, suitable for community-scale deployment. The process achieved a biochar yield of 60.95 %, an energy yield of 87.43 %, and a high heating value of 31.97 MJ/kg, classifying the product as premium-grade. Financial modelling included capital and operational costs, break-even point (BEP), net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR), supported by sensitivity analysis under varying market conditions. Under moderate scenarios, the system achieved an IRR exceeding 40 % and a payback period of less than two years. The analysis further explored scaling strategies, carbon offset potential, and enabling policy mechanisms relevant to palm oil-producing regions. Each batch was estimated to sequester 0.55 t-CO2-eq, aligning with circular bioeconomy goals and rural climate mitigation strategies. The model demonstrates that integrating biochemical pretreatment with co-torrefaction offers a viable and replicable solution for sustainable waste valorization, energy access, and carbon management in Southeast Asia. This study addresses key knowledge gaps by linking process optimization with economic and policy analysis, offering practical insights for cleaner production in decentralized settings.
