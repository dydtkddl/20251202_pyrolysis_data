Performance and ecological parameters of a diesel engine fueled with diesel and plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) at variable working parameters Plastics are one of the major pollutants to the environment. An investigation is carried out in converting low density polyethylene (LDPE) to oil by pyrolysis method with the aid of catalyst for the use in internal combustion engines. Experiments were conducted at different speeds (1200, 1500 and 1800 rpm) and variable loads (low, medium and full) with constant compression ratio engine to evaluate the performance and ecological parameters. Plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) is blended with diesel fuel in 20:80 volume proportion to get D80PO20 blended mixture which is employed in engine in order to assess its characteristics. Encouraging outcomes have been obtained as cylinder pressure in combustion is of same order as that of diesel fueled engine. The results showed that increasing engine speeds resulted in higher cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency. Also, high nitrogen oxide (NO X ) and low brake specific energy consumption (BSFC) has been identified. Lower smoke (BSN) and NO X emissions are noticed from engine tail pipe with D80PO20 blended mixture.
