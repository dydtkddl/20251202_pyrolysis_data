You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance and ecological parameters of a diesel engine fueled with diesel and plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) at variable working parameters Plastics are one of the major pollutants to the environment. An investigation is carried out in converting low density polyethylene (LDPE) to oil by pyrolysis method with the aid of catalyst for the use in internal combustion engines. Experiments were conducted at different speeds (1200, 1500 and 1800 rpm) and variable loads (low, medium and full) with constant compression ratio engine to evaluate the performance and ecological parameters. Plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) is blended with diesel fuel in 20:80 volume proportion to get D80PO20 blended mixture which is employed in engine in order to assess its characteristics. Encouraging outcomes have been obtained as cylinder pressure in combustion is of same order as that of diesel fueled engine. The results showed that increasing engine speeds resulted in higher cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency. Also, high nitrogen oxide (NO X ) and low brake specific energy consumption (BSFC) has been identified. Lower smoke (BSN) and NO X emissions are noticed from engine tail pipe with D80PO20 blended mixture.
