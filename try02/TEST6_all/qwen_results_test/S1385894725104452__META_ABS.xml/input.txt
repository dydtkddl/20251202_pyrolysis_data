Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) copolymer materials: Structural design, synthesis strategy, the relationship between structure and performance, industrial application Polylactic acid (PLA) is a sustainable polymer renowned for its excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, and it has found widespread applications in biomedicine, packaging, and additive manufacturing. However, its inherent brittleness and the challenges associated with controlling its degradation rate significantly limit broader utilization. To address these issues, various PLA-based copolymers—such as block, graft, alternating, and random copolymers—have been developed via copolymerization strategies. In this review, we systematically examine the classification, synthetic methodologies, and structure-property relationships of PLA copolymers within an integrated “structure-performance-application” framework, highlighting their applications in biomedical engineering, 3D printing, and sustainable packaging. By providing a comprehensive analysis of design strategies and performance optimization, this work offers both theoretical insights and practical guidance for advancing multifunctional, high-performance PLA-based materials, and outlines prospects for their future development in biomedicine, green materials, and advanced manufacturing.
