You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen generation from the methanolysis of ammonia borane catalyzed by in situ generated, polymer stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters Addressed herein is the detailed study on in situ generation of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters and their catalysis in the methanolysis of ammonia borane (AB). PVP-stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters with an average particle size of 2.4±1.2nm were generated in situ from the reduction of ruthenium(III) chloride during the methanolysis of AB in the presence of PVP at room temperature. The nanoclusters were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, XPS and FT-IR techniques. PVP stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters are highly active and stable catalyst in hydrogen generation from the methanolysis of AB with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 4017h−1 and 71,500 turnovers over 25h. Mercury poisoning experiments showed that the PVP-stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters are the true heterogeneous catalyst in the methanolysis of AB. The report also includes the results of a detailed kinetic study on the hydrogen generation from the methanolysis of AB catalyzed by PVP stabilized ruthenium(0) nanoclusters investigating the effect of the catalyst concentration, substrate concentration, and temperature as well as the activation parameters of catalytic methanolysis of AB calculated from the kinetic data.
