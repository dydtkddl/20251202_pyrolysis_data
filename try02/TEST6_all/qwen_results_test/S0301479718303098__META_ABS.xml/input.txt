A review on acrylic based hydrogels and their applications in wastewater treatment The acrylic based hydrogels have attracted the attention of many researchers in the field of pollutants adsorption such as dyes and metal cations due to their high swelling and adsorption capacities. This review introduces acrylic based hydrogels and focuses on their adsorption properties. We first described the methods for synthesizing hydrogels. Usual methods of characterization of acrylic based hydrogels such as swelling, adsorption capacity and desorption efficiency of the pollutants have been investigated. In addition, the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models which determine the mechanism of pollutants' adsorption by hydrogels have been introduced and relations that determine the values of thermodynamic parameters which define accomplishment of adsorption process have been investigated. In the following sections, a perfect insight has been provided on natural and synthetic acrylic based hydrogels. The effective parameters of swelling and adsorption by acrylic based hydrogels have been reviewed and the mechanism of pollutant's adsorption by acrylic based hydrogels has been discussed.
