You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing thermal energy storage with industrial and agricultural waste-derived phase change materials: A path towards sustainable energy systems An overview is provided of the features to use certain waste streams from industry and agriculture as phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage (TES) applications. These PCMs, obtained from agro-industrial processes such as the conversion of fatty acid residues and recycled polyethylene glycol, have good latent heats and appropriate melting temperatures. Based on experimental evaluations, it was found that these materials were able to capture more heatthan conventional paraffin-based PCMs, while maintaining excellent stability after 2000 cycles. It also resulted in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from itslife cycle assessments and showed a reduction in production costs from traditional PCM production methods. The proven success of waste-derived PCMs in mediating building thermal management was demonstrated throughcase studies that established effective thermoregulation whilst concomitantly dissipating energy demands. Such low-cost, high-performance PCMs highlight the lagging innovation potential of this field bridging the gap with cutting-edge TES technologies and also the notions of a circulareconomy. Incorporating these sustainable materials into energystorage systems can help to promote renewable energy utilization and improve energy efficiency.
