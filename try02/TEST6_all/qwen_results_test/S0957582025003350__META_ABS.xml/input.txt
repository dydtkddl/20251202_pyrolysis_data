Advancing thermal energy storage with industrial and agricultural waste-derived phase change materials: A path towards sustainable energy systems An overview is provided of the features to use certain waste streams from industry and agriculture as phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage (TES) applications. These PCMs, obtained from agro-industrial processes such as the conversion of fatty acid residues and recycled polyethylene glycol, have good latent heats and appropriate melting temperatures. Based on experimental evaluations, it was found that these materials were able to capture more heatthan conventional paraffin-based PCMs, while maintaining excellent stability after 2000 cycles. It also resulted in a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from itslife cycle assessments and showed a reduction in production costs from traditional PCM production methods. The proven success of waste-derived PCMs in mediating building thermal management was demonstrated throughcase studies that established effective thermoregulation whilst concomitantly dissipating energy demands. Such low-cost, high-performance PCMs highlight the lagging innovation potential of this field bridging the gap with cutting-edge TES technologies and also the notions of a circulareconomy. Incorporating these sustainable materials into energystorage systems can help to promote renewable energy utilization and improve energy efficiency.
