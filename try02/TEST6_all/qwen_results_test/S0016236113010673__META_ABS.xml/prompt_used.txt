You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic gasification of cellulose and pinewood to H2 in supercritical water In this work, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of cellulose and pinewood was studied at different operating conditions without and with catalysts. The effects of two parameters including gasification temperature (400, 470, and 550°C) and water to biomass weight ratio (3:1 and 7:1) for different catalysts (Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, KOH, calcined dolomite and calcined olivine), were studied on SCWG of cellulose and pinewood. For non-catalytic runs, with an increase in water to biomass ratio from 3 to 7, H2 yield of cellulose gasification increased by 44%, 11% and 22% at 400, 470 and 550°C, respectively. For catalytic gasification of cellulose using KOH, H2 yield increased by 194% compared to that for non-catalytic run at 400°C and water to biomass ratio of 3. At the same operating conditions, the presence of Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 contributed to a 30.7% increase in H2 yield followed by a 28.3% increase using dolomite compared to that for non-catalytic run. As a real biomass, pinewood was gasified in supercritical water at the optimum operating conditions (550°C and water to biomass ratio of 7) obtained from set of experiments performed for cellulose, using three kinds of catalysts: Ni/CeO2/Al2O3, dolomite and KOH. At the same operating conditions, H2 yield for pinewood gasification was smaller than that for cellulose gasification in the range of 20.0–41.4% depending on the type of catalyst. The effects of catalyst on H2 production from SCW in the absence of biomass were also studied. The results showed that a trace amount of H2 was formed using Ni based catalyst or dolomite while small amount of CO2 was formed with Ni/AC.
