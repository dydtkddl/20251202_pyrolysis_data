You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combined sorbent and catalyst material for sorption enhanced reforming of methane under cyclic regeneration in presence of H2O and CO2 An investigation on an innovative calcium‑nickel Combined Sorbent and Catalyst Material (CSCM) for Sorption Enhanced Reforming (SER) of methane is presented in this paper. After hydrothermal synthesis, a nominal 30 wt% CaO-based sorbent supported on mayenite was physically mixed with a commercial reforming catalyst and granulated to obtain bifunctional particles of 200–300 μm. Materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface analysis (BET) and Mercury- intrusion prosimetry (Hg-porosimetry). A novel thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) approach was employed for investigating SER activity, particularly the materials performance during multicycling methane reforming and sorbent carbonation followed by regeneration in oxidative atmosphere – either in the presence of steam or CO2 at high temperature. When regeneration is carried out in 100 vol% CO2 at 925 °C, an intermediate reduction step between cycles was crucial to maintain the catalytic activity of the CSCM for 100 consecutive sorption-regeneration cycles. In spite of a stable catalytic activity, the initial sorption capacity of the CSCM sorbent function (~16gCO2 /100gCSCM) declined progressively with cyclic runs and stabilized at ~10gCO2 /100gCSCM from cycle 90 onwards. This decline in capacity has been related to CaO depletion by solid phase reaction with the catalyst support.
