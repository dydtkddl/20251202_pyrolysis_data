You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Identification and assessment of microplastics in wastewater treatment plants using laser direct infrared spectroscopy and depolymerization-coupled liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry The pollution levels and distribution characteristics of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) need to be well explored and evaluated for better control of MPs. The use of a single method may be inadequate to achieve comprehensive information on MPs. Studies using combinations of different analytical methods are rare and challenging. In this study, we combined laser direct infrared spectroscopy and depolymerization-coupled liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, for the first time, to explore and evaluate variation and distribution characteristics of MP number and mass concentrations in wastewater treatment systems. The removal rates (RRs) based on mass and number concentrations were inconsistent. The overall RRs for system A and B calculated by mass concentration were 96.8 % and 96.5 % respectively, whereas those by number concentration were 95.7 % and 97.0 %, respectively. However, the trend of MP removal across different treatment stages in the two wastewater treatment systems was consistent, as estimated using both applied methods. A significant correlation (R² > 0.88) was observed between the mass concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyamide (PA) MPs and number concentration of total MPs. The proportion of MPs varied by polymer type, size range, and shape throughout the treatment process. Based on the annual wastewater discharge estimate, approximately 1.7 × 1012 MP particles are released into the aquatic environment through effluent each year, with the total mass of PET, PC, and PA microplastics amounting to approximately 0.369 tons. Overall, this study provided valuable information for MP estimates, management planning, and control measures.
