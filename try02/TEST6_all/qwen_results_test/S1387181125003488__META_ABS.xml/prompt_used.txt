You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In situ synergistic catalysis by Nano-CeO2 oil dispersoid concerted with ZSM-5: Enhanced catalytic cracking for light olefins The metal modification of ZSM-5 by impregnation method has been widely researched and applied in industrial catalysis, but fundamental understanding of their structure-property relationships were still remained challenging, largely due to the cross influence from Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. Here, using the oil dispersed nano-CeO2 with surface modified in reactant hydrocarbon, we propose a method to strengthen the Brønsted acid in situ during catalytic cracking reaction, wherein the monoatomic Ce incorporated with ZSM-5 was observed. The material morphological evolvement and quantitative description of acid properties tuning were investigated to bridge the Ce deposition analytics and the mechanism exploration for activity promotion. Combining with the reaction kinetics study, this strategy was found to significantly promote the carbonium ion generation step in protonation (rate limit step) with much less load of Ce, lowered the apparent activation energy of ethylcyclohexane catalytic cracking by 41.1 % without the influence from Lewis acid variation, and foregrounded the development of advanced zeolite modification mode for light olefins production. The molecular simulation revealed the insights of how polyvalent monoatomic Ce regulated the bond strength of AlO-H, and enhanced the proton donating ability of zeolite.
