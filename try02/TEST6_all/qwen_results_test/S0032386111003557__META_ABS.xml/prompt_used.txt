You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An experimental and theoretical investigation of the compressive properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube/poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposite foams Polymer nanocomposite foams are promising low density substitutes for nanocomposites. Carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposite foams possess high strength, low density, and can be made conductive. Good control of foam properties is of great importance in the application of such materials. In the current study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with controlled aspect ratio were used to alter the foam morphology in MWNT/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposite foams produced by a supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) foaming process. It was found that with the addition of one weight percent of MWNTs, the Young’s modulus of polymer foams increased by as much as 82%, and the collapse strength increased by as much as 104%. The influence of MWNT aspect ratio on the compressive properties of nanocomposite foams was investigated. The addition of MWNTs influenced the foam properties in two ways: improving the compressive properties of the solid matrix, and reducing the bubble size of the nanocomposite foams. A modified constitutive model for predicting the compressive properties of high density closed-cell polymer foams was developed. The influence of the bubble size on the mechanical properties of polymer foams was discussed based on the new model.
