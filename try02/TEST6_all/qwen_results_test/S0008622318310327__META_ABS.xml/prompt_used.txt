You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of graphene nanoplate and carbonized loofah fiber on the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of PEEK-based composites Graphene nanoplate (GNP)/carbonized loofah fiber (CLF)/polyether-ether- ketone (PEEK) composites were fabricated by compressive moulding technology. A three-dimensional multi-interface conductive network of CLF and GNP within the matrix was observed under scanning electron microscope. The combination of CLF and GNP improve the electromagnetic shielding performance of composites in the X-band region. The average total shielding effectiveness of the composite reached 27.1 dB at the addition of 9 wt% CLF. The electromagnetic shielding performance of the composites is significantly improved due to the gradual formation of the conductive network structured with CLF and GNP. The shielding mechanism of composites is dominated by absorption, due to the contribution of absorption to shielding effectiveness is much greater than that of the reflection. Furthermore, the composites exhibit prominent mechanical property and thermal stability, which the compressive strength and modulus of GNP/CLF/PEEK composite with 3 wt% CLF loading reaches 114.6 MPa and 0.71 GPa and the temperature of all composites reaches 550 °C at 10% mass loss. The results indicate that the composite material shows potential applications in extremely harsh environments such as aerospace, warships, and special devices as structural and functional integrated materials.
