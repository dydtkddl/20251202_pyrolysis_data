You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A highly efficient dual-phase GaN(O)/Nb2O5(N) photocatalyst prepared through nitridation and reoxidation process for NO removal Dual-phase Nb2O5(N)/GaN(O) photocatalyst with N doping in Nb2O5 and O doping in GaN was synthesized via nitridation and re-oxidation (NRO) of GaNbO4. The NRO process induced the formation of nanosized heterojunctions between the Nb2O5(N) and GaN(O) phase. The utilization of GaNbO4 as a precursor enhances the nitridation process than pure gallium oxide while retards the oxidation of pure niobium nitride to give an improved doping composite showing a desired bandgap around 2.0 eV with indirect transition. The photocatalyst exhibited very high NO removal efficiency (nearly 100%) under visible-light and very high selectivity (89%) for the formation of ionic species rather than more toxic NO2, which could be related to the intimate junction between the GaN(O) phase with high conduction band minimum and Nb2O5 phase with low valence band maximum for the simultaneous generation of •O2¯ and •OH radicals, respectively. The NRO process sheds light on the preparation of a nanoscale dual-phase photocatalyst containing nitride and oxide.
