Artificial intelligence in plastic recycling and conversion: A review Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential in promoting sustainable plastic waste recycling and management. This review explores the integration of AI in plastic waste recycling and conversion, with a focus on identifying characterization, thermochemical conversion, and bioconversion technologies. AI has enhanced the precision in sorting and identifying plastic types, significantly reducing contamination rates and improving processing efficiency. These algorithms not only optimize the identification process with high-tech optical sensors and infrared spectroscopy but also refine thermochemical conversion methods by accurately predicting and controlling reaction conditions that maximize product yield and quality. AI supports the development of bioconversion methods to optimize the activity of specific enzymes and microbial processes involved in plastic degradation. The R2 of most of these AI models are reported to have a value higher than 0.9. This review also identifies current research gaps and proposes future research directions for AI in the field of plastic recycling.
