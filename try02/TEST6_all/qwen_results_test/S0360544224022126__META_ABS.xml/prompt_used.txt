You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Techno-economic, techno-environmental assessments, and deep learning optimization of an integrated system for CO2 capturing from a gas turbine: Tehran case study This study investigates methods to reduce heat losses, CO2 emissions, and improve the overall efficiency of micro gas turbine power plants, considering economic viability as gas turbines are a major component of the global energy supply chain. Heat recovery and carbon capture techniques were employed to achieve these goals. First, a steam Rankine cycle and a greenhouse were designed to integrate with an existing micro gas turbine. Second, the entire system was simulated using thermodynamic, economic, and environmental models. Finally, an optimization process was conducted through a machine learning model using the integrated model. By adding a Rankine cycle, 80 % of the heat losses in a traditional power plant were recovered, converted into electricity and cooling, and resulted in a 3 % efficiency improvement. Additionally, implementing a CO2 separation and capture unit with utilization in a nearby greenhouse not only enhanced greenhouse profitability but also significantly reduced CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. While the system's cost rate increased by $40/hour, the investment payback period is only 0.97 years. Furthermore, CO2 emission rate was reduced by 15 %.
