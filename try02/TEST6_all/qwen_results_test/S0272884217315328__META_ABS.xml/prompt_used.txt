You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly ordered macroporous γ-alumina prepared by a modified sol-gel method with a PMMA microsphere template for enhanced Pb2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ removal The adsorption performance of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) γ-alumina was investigated for enhanced Pb2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ removal. The synthesis was based on a modified sol-gel method using a colloidal crystal template (CCT) method based on PMMA microspheres. The structure was characterized by means of FTIR spectroscopy and XRD analysis. The three-dimensional structure was examined by scanning electron microscopy, which enabled image analysis that showed significantly low shrinkage (8.77%) after calcination at 800°C. The influential parameters, including contact time and adsorbent dosage, were investigated in a batch adsorption study. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetic data were found to be in agreement with the Freundlich isotherm for Pb2+ removal and the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm for Ni2+ and Cd2+ removal. The time-dependent adsorption was best described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Weber-Morris model. High adsorption capacities: 95.39, 23.32 and 25.39mg/g were obtained for Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ removal at 45°C, respectively. The existence of interconnected macroporous and mesoporous structures of highly ordered γ-alumina enabled a higher adsorption capacity in comparison with literature data for others alumina-based adsorbents.
