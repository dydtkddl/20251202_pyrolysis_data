Nanoparticles: From synthesis to applications and beyond In modern-day research, nanoparticles (size < 100nm) are an indispensable tool for various applications, especially in the field of biomedicine. Although enormous efforts have been made to understand the properties and specificities of nanoparticles, many questions are still not answered and the new ones arise. In this review we summarize current trends in the nanoparticle synthesis and characterization and interpret the stability of nanoparticles in various media from aqueous solutions to biological milieu important for the in vitro and in vivo studies. To get more detailed insight into nanoparticle charging properties and interactions of nanoparticles with interfaces the theoretical models are presented. Finally, the overview of nanoparticle applications is given and the future prospects are discussed.
