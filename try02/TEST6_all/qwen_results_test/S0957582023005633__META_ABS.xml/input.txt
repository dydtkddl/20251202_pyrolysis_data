The good, the bad, the advantage of washing pretreatment in reducing slagging and fouling index during the torrefaction process This review paper focuses on investigating the effectiveness of washing pretreatment in reducing slagging and fouling index during the combustion process of empty fruit bunches (EFB) materials. Slagging and fouling are common problems encountered in combustion systems that burn these types of materials for energy generation, leading to operational and maintenance issues. Washing pretreatment has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these problems by removing undesirable chemical species from the biomass before combustion. This paper examines the existing literature on the effectiveness of washing pretreatment in reducing slagging and fouling index during the combustion process. The review covers various aspects, including washing methods, and combustion conditions used in previous studies. The review highlights that washing pretreatment can effectively reduce slagging and fouling index during the combustion process of EFBs. The paper also discusses the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of washing pretreatments, such as the removal of alkali and heavy metal compounds, and the reduction in ash content. Finally, the review paper provides recommendations for future research directions in this area. Overall, this study provides valuable insight into the factors, such as temperature, soak time, and water use, that can reduce slagging and fouling during the combustion process and have the potential to increase the effectiveness and dependability of energy generation systems.
