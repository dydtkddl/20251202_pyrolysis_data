You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The good, the bad, the advantage of washing pretreatment in reducing slagging and fouling index during the torrefaction process This review paper focuses on investigating the effectiveness of washing pretreatment in reducing slagging and fouling index during the combustion process of empty fruit bunches (EFB) materials. Slagging and fouling are common problems encountered in combustion systems that burn these types of materials for energy generation, leading to operational and maintenance issues. Washing pretreatment has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these problems by removing undesirable chemical species from the biomass before combustion. This paper examines the existing literature on the effectiveness of washing pretreatment in reducing slagging and fouling index during the combustion process. The review covers various aspects, including washing methods, and combustion conditions used in previous studies. The review highlights that washing pretreatment can effectively reduce slagging and fouling index during the combustion process of EFBs. The paper also discusses the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of washing pretreatments, such as the removal of alkali and heavy metal compounds, and the reduction in ash content. Finally, the review paper provides recommendations for future research directions in this area. Overall, this study provides valuable insight into the factors, such as temperature, soak time, and water use, that can reduce slagging and fouling during the combustion process and have the potential to increase the effectiveness and dependability of energy generation systems.
