You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Manganese effect on the microstructural transformation and mechanical properties of oxide dispersion strengthened steels fabricated with pre-alloyed powders The effect of Mn on the microstructure and mechanical properties of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels prepared with pre-alloyed powders were evaluated. Two sets of ODS steels with nominal compositions (wt. %) of Fe-2.9Cr-0.25Ti-0.1Y-0.3Y2O3-0.2C (labeled as PA0) and Fe–25Mn-2.9Cr-0.25Ti-0.1Y-0.3Y2O3-0.2C (labeled as PA25) were fabricated. The microstructures were systematically investigated using X-ray powder diffraction, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Fine oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were observed in the matrices of both PA0 and PA25. However, few agglomerates of Y2Ti2O7 and TiMn2O4 were observed in PA25. Tensile and Charpy impact properties at room, subzero, and high temperatures were also examined. Tensile test results showed that the yield and ultimate strengths were higher in PA0 due to its finer oxide NPs. Conversely, PA25 showed a higher ductility and work hardening rate ascribed to the high number of mechanical twins in its austenitic matrix. Similarly, Charpy impact energies at both room and subzero temperatures were higher in PA25, which could be explained by the high number of mechanical twins and strain-induced ε h c p -martensite transformation in PA25. We suggest that to prevent the formation of agglomerates and improve the mechanical properties of Mn-added ODS steel, Mn should be introduced not in the pre-mixed state, as was done here, but in the pre-alloyed state, which will be the focus of future studies.
