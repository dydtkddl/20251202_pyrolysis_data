You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Constructing high-performance N-doped carbon nanotubes anode by tuning interlayer spacing and the compatibility mechanism with ether electrolyte for sodium-ion batteries The graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a promising high-nitrogen carbon material has attracted abundant attentions in energy storage field. In this work, the N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) are synthesized through a facile one-step pyrolysis of g-C3N4 precursor assisting by Ni catalyst. The obtained N-CNTs possess unique one-dimensional (1D) nanotubular structure, high conductivity, suitable N-doping around 8.73 ∼ 14.72 at.% and tunable interlayer distance up to 0.462 nm which can accommodate sufficiently Na+. Serving as anodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the resultant N-CNTs exhibit a promising specific capacity of 290.3 mAh⋅g−1 at 0.05 A⋅g−1 and superior rate capability of 164.5 mAh⋅g−1 at 10 A⋅g−1, as well as excellent long-term cycling performance at 0.5 A⋅g−1 for 1000 cycles. Further kinetic analysis and ex-situ Raman reveal the sodium storage mechanism of N-CNTs, which simultaneously combines the diffusion and the dominated capacitive mechanisms together. According to the first principles, density functional theory (DFT) calculations from the perspective of atomic structure further demonstrate that the superior electrochemical performance of N-CNTs is attributed to the strong adsorption interaction between Na+ in ether-based electrolyte and pyrrolic N site. This work provides a facile method to synthesize N-doped carbon nanotube with remarkable electrochemical performance, which is a promising nanotube-structured anode material for the practical application of SIBs.
