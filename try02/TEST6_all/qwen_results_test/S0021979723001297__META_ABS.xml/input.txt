Copper indium sulfide quantum dots in photocatalysis Since the advent of photocatalytic technology, scientists have been searching for semiconductor materials with high efficiency in solar energy utilization and conversion to chemical energy. Recently, the development of quantum dot (QD) photocatalysts has attracted much attention because of their unique characteristics: small size, quantum effects, strong surface activity, and wide photoresponse range. Among ternary chalcogenide semiconductors, CuInS2 QDs are increasingly examined in the field of photocatalysis due to their high absorption coefficients, good matching of the absorption range with sunlight spectrum, long lifetimes of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and environmental sustainability. In this review paper, the structural and electronic properties, synthesis methods and various photocatalytic applications of CuInS2 QDs are systematically expounded. The current research status on the photocatalytic properties of materials based on CuInS2 QD is discussed combined with the existing modification approaches for the enhancement of their performances. Future challenges and new development opportunities of CuInS2 QDs in the field of photocatalysis are then prospected.
