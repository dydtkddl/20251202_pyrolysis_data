In-situ catalytic synergistic interaction between self-contained K and added Ni in biomass fast/slow pyrolysis Interaction between AAEMs and added metals in biomass has been reflected in the form of "auxiliary agents", ignoring the influence of self-contained AAEMs and the migration and transformation of biomass on the added transition metals. The fast/slow pyrolysis experiments of biomass containing Ni and K were conducted in the fixed bed reactor, and the interaction mechanism between self-contained K and added Ni was simulated using DFT. The results show that Ni is mainly distributed on the surface of the solid carbon matrix through adsorption and aggregated into nickel crystal particles. K accumulates inside the carbon matrix as C–K or C–O–K. K enhances the catalytic activity of Ni by enhancing the binding ability of Ni and biochar (increased to 354.89 kJ/mol), electron inversion and deficient oxygen. This study provides new insights into the design of biomass catalysts and the utilization of biomass energy.
