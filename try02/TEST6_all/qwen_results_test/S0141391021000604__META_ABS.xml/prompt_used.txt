You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of plastic waste using flash pyrolysis – Effect of mixture composition Recovery of plastic waste is becoming crucial since the amount of such waste increases continuously. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of the pyrolysis technique for the recovery of plastic waste. In that frame, the influence of temperature (550°C or 600°C) on the pyrolysis of pure polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was first studied. It is shown that whatever the type of polymer, aromatic compounds are mainly formed and could reach 55wt.-% of the oil fraction for PP and 31wt.-% for PE at 550°C. In a second step, a PP/PE mixture and a model mixture representative of the packaging plastic waste stream were pyrolyzed to investigate the influence of a combination of polymers on the proportions and composition of the different fractions. The pyrolysis of the polymer mixtures shows that, even if the aromatic compounds formed are similar to those obtained for the virgin polymers, the proportion of aromatic compounds is much more important than when the polymers are pyrolyzed alone. Indeed, mixing PE with PP at a 50/50 ratio does not affect the amount of liquid, gas and solid fractions but leads to the formation of a higher quantity of xylene (39 wt-%) at 550°C. The combination of the plastics in the model mixture has also led to a decrease of the amount of waxy compounds. Furthermore, it was shown that a higher amount of aromatics than expected was formed. As a conclusion, this study demonstrates that pyrolysis is an effective technique to recover plastic waste as aromatic compounds for the petroleum industry. In the specific conditions used in this study (proposed model mixture and pyrolysis conditions), it will favor the idea that sorting is not needed to recover plastic waste through pyrolysis since aromatics formation is favored when the stream is composed of a mixture of polymers.
