You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorizing plastic toy wastes to flammable gases through CO2-mediated pyrolysis with a Co-based catalyst Toys are discarded due to their short life cycle. Unfortunately, development of sustainable disposal platform for toy has not gained particular concern. To establish a reliable disposal platform, this study employed a pyrolysis platform to valorize plastics into value-added fuels. To confer more environmentally resilient process, CO2 was used as a feedstock to enhance the process efficiency from a perspective of the yield of flammable gases. To this end, waste toy brick (WTB) was used as a model compound. The exact types of plastics (polyacrylonitrile, polybutadiene, polystyrene, and polymethyl methacrylate) in WTB were experimentally determined. In pyrolysis of WTB, the complicated mixture of benzene derivatives was inevitably generated. To detoxify them by means of syngas (H2/CO) production, catalytic pyrolysis was performed. Co catalyst effectively induced chemical bond scissions, leading to substantially enhanced H2 formation. Also, the gas phase reactions (GPRs) between CO2 and volatile compounds over Co catalyst expedited the production rate of CO, and such CO enhancement effectively offered a chance to mitigate toxic chemical generations. The synergistic contribution of CO2 and Co catalyst enhanced syngas formation more than 25 times in reference to pyrolysis of WTB without Co catalyst. The GPRs also greatly prevented catalyst deactivation.
