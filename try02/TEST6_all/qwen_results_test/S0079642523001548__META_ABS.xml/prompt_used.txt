You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Binary and ternary metal oxide semiconductor thin films for effective gas sensing applications: A comprehensive review and future prospects For a couple of decades, there is a tremendous growth in industries and technology in the global level. Unfortunately, emerging new industries became a main reason for rising air pollution in the earth’s environment. Hence, the health issues associated with air pollution are on a high scale that alarm us to monitor the quality of the air that we breathe, and demand development of efficient gas sensor devices. Recently, the groups of binary and ternary metal oxide semiconductors are regarded as reliable materials for gas sensing applications. Chemical spray pyrolysis, one of the efficient techniques to fabricate thin films with high reproducibility is triggering recent research on fabricating films for gas sensor applications. Here, the focus is on spray-deposited binary and ternary metal oxide thin films for gas sensing applications. The working mechanism of metal oxide sensors have been discussed comprehensively on the basis of redox reaction processes that caused band bending and variation of electrical conductivity of devices in the presence of target gases. This review also points out the shortcomings of existing technology and the possible ways to overcome them, and eventually future evolution in the field of gas sensor are also hypothesized.
