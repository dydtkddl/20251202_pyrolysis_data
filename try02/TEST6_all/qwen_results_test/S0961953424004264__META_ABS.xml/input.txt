Co-hydrothermal carbonisation of sewage sludge and kitchen waste: Influence of process parameters This study assessed the impact of process temperature and time on the co-hydrothermal carbonisation (co-HTC) of kitchen waste and sewage sludge. To address the limitations of using a single feedstock and to circumvent the energy costs associated with pre-drying, the two organic feedstocks were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (wet basis). Co-HTC experimental runs were conducted in the temperature range of 180 °C–260 °C for 1, 3, and 5h durations. Co-HTC for sewage sludge and kitchen waste (1:1 ratio) at 260 °C temperature for 3h duration demonstrated optimal energy enrichment with a maximum energy and carbon densification of 1.50 and 1.47, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the hydrochar (HC) produced at 260 °C temperature for 3h duration underwent multistage decomposition with stable intermediates due to the formation of more stable aromatic structures and a heat energy of 21.29 kJ g−1 at 292.87 °C. At the optimal reaction conditions, the process water (PW) exhibited a high volatile fatty acids (VFA) and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration of 1420 mg L−1 and 431.2 mg L−1, indicating its potential for simultaneous energy recovery through anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery.
