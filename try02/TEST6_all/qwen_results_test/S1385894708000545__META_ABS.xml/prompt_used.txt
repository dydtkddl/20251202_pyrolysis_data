You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mathematical modelling and simulation approaches of agricultural residues air gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor Agricultural residues (agro-biomass) can produce energy by thermochemical conversion. Gasification is becoming one of the best clean technologies for power production. Thermochemical process of gasification sets free the solid fuel inherent energy and converts the solid phase into a mixture of gases (producer gas or syngas) that carries a percentage of this energy. Fluidized bed reactors may be used for biomass gasification offering many advantages such as: (1) the superior mixing properties and (2) the enhanced heat transfer rates between the gas and the particles as well as between the particles and the heat exchanger surfaces. In this paper gasification process applied to agricultural residues is reviewed by means of modelling. Description of various stages of the biomass gasification in a fluidized bed is made and the whole spectrum of problems from the processes in an individual biomass particle (drying, pyrolysis, fragmentation and charl burning) to the global mass transfer and chemical processes in a fluidized bed reactor and freeboard is presented. The paper discusses also the specific problems arising from using agricultural residues as raw material and recommends further experimental studies necessary for process optimisation and for scale up. Extensive investigation of gasification plant behaviour depending on various operating parameters is always required in order to support the optimisation procedure and mathematical models are helpful to reduce the temporal and financial efforts.
