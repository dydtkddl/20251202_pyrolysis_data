You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combustion behavior and pollutant emission characteristics of polymers and biomass in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor The paper presents the results of combustion of polymers and biomass in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. It was determined that 850 °C is the minimum temperature at which the combustion process should be carried out. To simulate bubbles’ chemical composition in a hot fluidized bed, TG analysis coupled with FTIR analysis was performed under pyrolysis conditions. Recorded IR spectra were deconvoluted to determine the composition of fuel bubbles in the fluidized bed. It was shown that a uniform access to oxygen is necessary for the combustion of complex gas mixtures. The combustion processes were conducted in two ways. The materials were burned autothermally and in the process of co-combustion together with auxiliary fuel. Inorganic and organic substances were identified in the flue gases. The latter contained mainly short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. The detailed emission characteristics of gaseous products during the combustion of the polymeric materials in the bubbling fluidized bed was investigated. The increase of the combustion temperature intensifies the oxidation of the fuel-bound nitrogen and the NO conversion to N2 on the surface of the char. The obtained values of emission coefficients for different polymers will be useful in the choice of appropriate method of combustion of alternative fuels.
