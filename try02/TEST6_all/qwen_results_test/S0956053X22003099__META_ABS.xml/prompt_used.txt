You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research on the pyrolysis characteristics and mechanisms of waste printed circuit boards at fast and slow heating rates The pyrolysis treatment of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) shows great potential for sustainable treatment and hazard reduction. In this work, based on thermogravimetry (TG), pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and density functional theory (DFT), the thermal weight loss, product distribution, and kinetics of WPCBs pyrolysis were studied by single-step and multi-step pyrolysis at fast (600 °C/min) and slow (10 °C/min) heating rates. The heating rates of TG and Py-GC/MS were the same for each group of experiments. In addition, the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of WPCBs polymer monomers was calculated by DFT method. Compared with slow pyrolysis, the final weight loss of fast pyrolysis is reduced by 0.76 wt%. The kinetic analysis indicates that the activation energies of main pyrolysis stages range from 98.29 kJ/mol to 177.59 kJ/mol. The volatile products of fast pyrolysis are mainly phenols and aromatics. With the increase of multi-step pyrolysis temperature, the order of the escaping volatiles is phenols, hydrocarbyl phenols, aromatics, and benzene (or diphenyl phenol). The pyrolysis residue of WPCBs may contains phenolics and polymers. Based on the free radical reactions, the mechanism and reaction pathways of WPCBs pyrolysis were deduced by the DFT. Moreover, a large amount of benzene is produced by pyrolysis, and its formation mechanism was elaborated.
