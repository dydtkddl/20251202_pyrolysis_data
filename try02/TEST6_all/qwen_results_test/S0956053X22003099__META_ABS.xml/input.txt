Research on the pyrolysis characteristics and mechanisms of waste printed circuit boards at fast and slow heating rates The pyrolysis treatment of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) shows great potential for sustainable treatment and hazard reduction. In this work, based on thermogravimetry (TG), pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and density functional theory (DFT), the thermal weight loss, product distribution, and kinetics of WPCBs pyrolysis were studied by single-step and multi-step pyrolysis at fast (600 °C/min) and slow (10 °C/min) heating rates. The heating rates of TG and Py-GC/MS were the same for each group of experiments. In addition, the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of WPCBs polymer monomers was calculated by DFT method. Compared with slow pyrolysis, the final weight loss of fast pyrolysis is reduced by 0.76 wt%. The kinetic analysis indicates that the activation energies of main pyrolysis stages range from 98.29 kJ/mol to 177.59 kJ/mol. The volatile products of fast pyrolysis are mainly phenols and aromatics. With the increase of multi-step pyrolysis temperature, the order of the escaping volatiles is phenols, hydrocarbyl phenols, aromatics, and benzene (or diphenyl phenol). The pyrolysis residue of WPCBs may contains phenolics and polymers. Based on the free radical reactions, the mechanism and reaction pathways of WPCBs pyrolysis were deduced by the DFT. Moreover, a large amount of benzene is produced by pyrolysis, and its formation mechanism was elaborated.
