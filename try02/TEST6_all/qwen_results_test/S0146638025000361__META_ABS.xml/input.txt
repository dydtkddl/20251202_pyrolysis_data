Molecular and isotope characterization of hydrocarbon products from organic-sulfur-rich mudstones during closed hydrous-pyrolysis A series of mudstones with varying organic sulfur content were subjected to hydrous pyrolysis and the produced oil and gas were analyzed. The samples come from the late Devonian Duvernay Formation (Canada), the late Miocene Onnagawa Formation (Japan), and the early Jurassic Gordondale Member of the Fernie Formation (Canada), in order of increasing organic sulfur content. Comparison of molecular parameters in the produced oils and residual extracts showed that these have almost identical values, with linear correlation near 1:1, except for polycyclic aromatics such as alkylphenanthrenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes. The excellent correlation suggests that in an ideal scenario, in the absence of long-distance migration, hydrocarbon mixing, and secondary alteration, produced oils and residual bitumen would have very similar molecular properties. In addition, for the same %VReqv, samples with higher sulfur content exhibit an apparent higher thermal maturity according to molecular ratios such as Pr/nC18 and C30Hopane/C30Moretane. Generated gases showed source effects on their molecular and carbon isotope composition for the maturity interval analyzed herein (0.57 to 1.42 % VReqv). H2S gas was generated only from the Gordondale samples and the isotope values are presented in this study.
