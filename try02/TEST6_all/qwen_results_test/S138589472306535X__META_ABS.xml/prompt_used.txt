You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced lactide yield in catalytic conversion of L-lactic acid from passivation of external acidic sites on aluminosilicate Beta zeolites by coating siliceous Beta zeolite The development of efficient Beta zeolite for conversion of L-lactic acid (L-LA) to L,L-lactide (L-LT) is in urgent need but still remains challenging. Herein, we reported an enhancement of the L-LT yield by passivation of external acidic sites on aluminosilicate Beta zeolites by coating pure silica Beta (Al-Beta@Si-Beta). The passivation of external acidic sites was strongly evidenced by in situ 2,4,6-tritertbutylpyridine (TTBP) adsorption FT-IR spectra, where the external acidic sites of Al-Beta@Si-Beta were effectively covered. In the tests for conversion of L-LA to L-LT, the Al-Beta@Si-Beta exhibited much higher L-LT yield than commercial microporous Beta zeolite, which is reasonably attributed to that the passivation of external acidic sites of the Beta zeolite significantly decreases molecular weight of the reaction intermediates, favoring for reduction of coke formation. Furthermore, this strategy is extended to passivate mesoporous Beta zeolite (Al-Beta-meso@Si-Beta). As expected, the Al-Beta-meso@Si-Beta displayed higher L-LT yield than the Al-Beta@Si-Beta because the presence of mesoporosity in the zeolite catalyst is favorable for mass transfer in the conversion of L-LA to L-LT. The strategy for coating pure siliceous zeolite might offer a new opportunity to develop highly efficient zeolite catalysts for the production of L-LT in the future.
