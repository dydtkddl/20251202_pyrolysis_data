You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bionic structures and materials inspired by plant leaves: A comprehensive review for innovative problem-solving Leaves have developed various functional structures to enhance plant survival, making them the most typical bionic prototypes. Bionic research inspired by plant leaves has yielded numerous research results, a wide range of applications, and excellent problem-solving abilities, surpassing other bionic prototypes. Plant leaves are of great importance in bionics, and are currently experiencing an increasing level of recognition. However, a comprehensive review of advanced structures and functional materials inspired by plant leaf structures is still lacking. Therefore, we present this systematic and multidisciplinary review of plant leaf-based bionic design, based on our research findings and background, and in conjunction with existing literature. Our review categorizes existing bionic studies according to the functional features of plant leaves, encompassing photosynthesis, stress resistance, and auxiliary functions. It is the first attempt to systematically collate and analyze the vast and seemingly disorganized literature on plant leaf-based bionic research. Our analysis, summary, and outlook aim to provide researchers with a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the current state of plant leaf-based bionic design research. Furthermore, this review can inspire researchers and offer innovative ideas to solve relevant scientific and engineering problems.
