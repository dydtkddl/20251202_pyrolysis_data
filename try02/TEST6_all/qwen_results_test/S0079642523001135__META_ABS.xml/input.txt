Bionic structures and materials inspired by plant leaves: A comprehensive review for innovative problem-solving Leaves have developed various functional structures to enhance plant survival, making them the most typical bionic prototypes. Bionic research inspired by plant leaves has yielded numerous research results, a wide range of applications, and excellent problem-solving abilities, surpassing other bionic prototypes. Plant leaves are of great importance in bionics, and are currently experiencing an increasing level of recognition. However, a comprehensive review of advanced structures and functional materials inspired by plant leaf structures is still lacking. Therefore, we present this systematic and multidisciplinary review of plant leaf-based bionic design, based on our research findings and background, and in conjunction with existing literature. Our review categorizes existing bionic studies according to the functional features of plant leaves, encompassing photosynthesis, stress resistance, and auxiliary functions. It is the first attempt to systematically collate and analyze the vast and seemingly disorganized literature on plant leaf-based bionic research. Our analysis, summary, and outlook aim to provide researchers with a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the current state of plant leaf-based bionic design research. Furthermore, this review can inspire researchers and offer innovative ideas to solve relevant scientific and engineering problems.
