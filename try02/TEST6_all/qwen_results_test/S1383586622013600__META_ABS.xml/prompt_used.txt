You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Breaking rate-limiting steps in a red mud-sewage sludge carbon catalyst activated peroxymonosulfate system: Effect of pyrolysis temperature The active sites on biochar surface could be increased via pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) with mixing red mud (RM), improving its catalytic activity effectively. Pyrolysis temperature plays an important role in the regulation of active sites on the catalyst surface. Herein, the RM-SS carbon-based catalysts (RSDBC) were prepared under different pyrolysis temperatures to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation. It was found that the rate-limiting step (first oxidation stage) of the RSDBC-500/PMS system could be broken by increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 500 °C to 700 °C, leading to a 1.9-fold increase in SMX degradation efficiency within 120 min. Furthermore, the specific surface area (SSA) and the content of CO, defects, Fe(II), pyridinic N, and graphite N sites of RSDBC increased during the elevation of temperature (500-700 °C), thereby facilitating PMS activation and active species production. The breakage of the rate-limiting step provided the theoretical basis for the optimal preparation of sludge biochar-based catalysts, which is beneficial to promote the application of RSDBC/PMS system in wastewater treatment.
