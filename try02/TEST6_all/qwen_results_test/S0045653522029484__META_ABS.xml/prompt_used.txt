You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics in sewage sludge: Distribution, toxicity, identification methods, and engineered technologies Microplastic pollution is becoming a global challenge due to its long-term accumulation in the environment, causing adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. Sludge discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) plays a critical role as a carrier and primary source of environmental microplastic contamination. A significantly average microplastic variation between 1000 and 301,400 particles kg−1 has been reported in the sludge samples. In recent years, advanced technologies have been successfully applied to address this issue, including adsorption, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and membrane bioreactors (MBRs). Adsorption technologies are essential to utilizing novel adsorbents (e.g., biochar, graphene, zeolites) for effectively removing MPs. Especially, the removal efficiency of polymer microspheres from an aqueous solution by Mg/Zn modified magnetic biochars (Mg/Zn-MBC) was obtained at more than 95%. Also, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely applied to degrade microplastic contaminants, in which photocatalytic by semiconductors (e.g., TiO2 and ZnO) is a highly suitable approach to promote the degradation reactions owing to strongly hydroxyl radicals (OH*). Biological degradation-aided microorganisms (e.g., bacterial and fungal strains) have been reported to be suitable for removing microplastics. Yet, it was affected by biotic and abiotic factors of the environmental conditions (e.g., pH, light, temperature, moisture, bio-surfactants, microorganisms, enzymes) as well as their polymer characteristics, i.e., molecular weight, functional groups, and crystallinity. Notably, membrane bioreactors (MBRs) showed the highest efficiency in removing up to 99% microplastic particles and minimizing their contamination in sewage sludge. Further, MBRs illustrate the suitability for treating high-strength compounds, e.g., polymer debris and microplastic fibers from complex industrial wastewater. Finally, this study provided a comprehensive understanding of potential adverse risks, transportation pathways, and removal mechanisms of microplastic, which full-filled the knowledge gaps in this field.
