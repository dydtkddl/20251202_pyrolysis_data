You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal behavior, synergistic effect and thermodynamic parameter evaluations of biomass/plastics co–pyrolysis in a concentrating photothermal TGA The heating rate would significantly impact the pyrolysis process, especially for the reactions containing synergistic effects between two different feedstocks. Co-pyrolysis of two widely available biomass (CC–corncob and PS–peanut shell) with plastic (PET–polyethylene terephthalate and PVC–polyvinyl chloride) was studied in a concentrating photothermal thermogravimetric analysis (CP-TGA) system at three heating rates (100, 500, 1000℃/min). The TG and DTG curves of CC and PS differ due to their polymeric components (holocellulose and lignin); two pronounced levels at 100 and 500 ℃/min heating rates were present in PVC. With increasing heating rate, the lateral shift towards higher temperature regions in the TG and DTG curves exceeded 100 °C. The synergistic effects on the blend samples were concentrated in the main decomposition region (250–580℃) due to rapid volatiles release, and the discrepancy values further stabilized at the final decomposition stages. The activation energy (Ea) was assessed using a comparative study of isoconversional methods, namely Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and Starink. The isoconversional methods demonstrated that the co-pyrolysis process required about 30 % less activation energy than the pyrolysis of plastic (PET/PVC) alone. Coats-Redfern's (CR) model-fitting approach was used to identify the kinetic triplet of the devolatilization stage. The CR models revealed that biomass–PET blends belong to two to four-dimensional diffusion models, whereas biomass–PVC blends are dominated by chemical reactions of 1.5 and 2 orders. The energy barrier between activation energy (Ea) and change in enthalpy (ΔH) for all the blend samples was lower (∼5–6 kJmol−1), which slightly increased at higher heating rate.
