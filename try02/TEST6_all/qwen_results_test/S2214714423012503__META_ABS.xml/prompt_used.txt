You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

UV-LED cocatalytic Fe3+/peroxymonosulfate process for the degradation of sulfamethoxypyridazine: Performance, mechanism and DBP formation during postchlorination Herein, a UV-LED-catalytic Fe3+/peroxymonosulfate homogeneous advanced oxidation process (UV-LED/Fe3+/PMS) was adopted for the removal of sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP), a commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic (SA), in water. Quenching experiments showed that SO4 ●–, •OH and Fe(IV) were generated in this system and contributed to the rapid removal of SMP. Generally, acidic media favored SMP degradation, and the contribution rate of active species to SMP removal was highly pH dependent. Higher light intensity and an equal Fe3+/PMS ratio (1:1) were appropriate for SMP removal. The introduction of HCO3 −, NO3 − and humic acid suppressed the degradation of SMP to different extents, but obvious acceleration was observed in the presence of halide ions. The transformation products were investigated, and their toxicity was also assessed. UV-LED/Fe3+/PMS was capable of controlling trichloromethane (TCM) during postchlorination while increasing the formation of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) owing to the generation of precursors having certain functional groups. Prolonging pretreatment time had a positive effect on reducing DBP formation. The presence of humic acid increased the formation of both TCM and DCAN. Furthermore, total trihalomethanes and dihaloacetonitriles increased with increasing bromide concentration, which needs to be considered when adopting the UV-LED/Fe3+/PMS as pretreatment for the abatement of SMP.
