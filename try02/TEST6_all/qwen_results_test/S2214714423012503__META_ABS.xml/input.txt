UV-LED cocatalytic Fe3+/peroxymonosulfate process for the degradation of sulfamethoxypyridazine: Performance, mechanism and DBP formation during postchlorination Herein, a UV-LED-catalytic Fe3+/peroxymonosulfate homogeneous advanced oxidation process (UV-LED/Fe3+/PMS) was adopted for the removal of sulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP), a commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic (SA), in water. Quenching experiments showed that SO4 ●–, •OH and Fe(IV) were generated in this system and contributed to the rapid removal of SMP. Generally, acidic media favored SMP degradation, and the contribution rate of active species to SMP removal was highly pH dependent. Higher light intensity and an equal Fe3+/PMS ratio (1:1) were appropriate for SMP removal. The introduction of HCO3 −, NO3 − and humic acid suppressed the degradation of SMP to different extents, but obvious acceleration was observed in the presence of halide ions. The transformation products were investigated, and their toxicity was also assessed. UV-LED/Fe3+/PMS was capable of controlling trichloromethane (TCM) during postchlorination while increasing the formation of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) owing to the generation of precursors having certain functional groups. Prolonging pretreatment time had a positive effect on reducing DBP formation. The presence of humic acid increased the formation of both TCM and DCAN. Furthermore, total trihalomethanes and dihaloacetonitriles increased with increasing bromide concentration, which needs to be considered when adopting the UV-LED/Fe3+/PMS as pretreatment for the abatement of SMP.
