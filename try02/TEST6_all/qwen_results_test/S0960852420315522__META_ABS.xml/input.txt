Pyrolysis of waste biomass and plastics for production of biochar and its use for removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution The aim of this work was to study the pyrolysis of waste biomass and plastics and use the produced biochar for the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution. The batch experiments of Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb with biochars and plastic chars were carried for determining the effects of various experimental parameters (feedstock, contact time, adsorbent dose, pH and pyrolysis temperature). The isothermal sorption models demonstrated that the sorption capacities of biochars are higher in comparison to the plastic chars. The maximum removal efficiency shown by biochars and plastic chars at pH 4 was 99.86% and 99.93%, respectively. Both the carbon materials are thereby recognized as an environment-friendly and efficient pollutant control material at various studied parameters.
