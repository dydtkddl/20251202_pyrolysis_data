You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mass concentration and distribution characteristics of microplastics in landfill mineralized refuse using efficient quantitative detection based on Py-GC/MS Landfilling is the most traditional disposal method of domestic waste. Plastic waste in landfill sites could degrade to microplastics (MPs) and diffuse to the surrounding environment with leachate. However, MPs pollution in landfill mineralized refuse has not been well recognized. In the present research, a detection method for mixed MPs of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) based on Py-GC/MS was established and verified. The method is suitable for the rapid quantitative detection of large-batch of complex solid matrix samples, with an average deviation of less than 10%. Based on the method, samples from a landfill site in South China were studied, where PE was found to be the main component. The total concentration of MPs in mineralized refuse was 7.62 kg/t in the old area and 5.49 kg/t in the young area. Further analysis showed that the content of MPs was correlated with that of plastic waste and the landfill age, indicating that a considerable proportion was secondary MPs. The reserves of MPs in landfill sites may have reached an alarming number. In the absence of adequate safeguards, quantities of MPs may spread from the landfill sites, resulting in serious pollution of the surrounding soil and groundwater.
