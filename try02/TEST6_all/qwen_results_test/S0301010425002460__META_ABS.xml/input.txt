Decomposition mechanism of isoprenoid p-cymene during supercritical water gasification by ReaxFF simulation Isoprenoid p-cymene exhibits severe coking tendency during pyrolysis, restricting its conversion efficiency when served as biofuels. However, this is expected to be mitigated through supercritical water gasification (SCWG), a clean and sustainable conversion technology. In this study, ReaxFF simulations are employed to investigate the SCWG process of p-cymene at 2800 K. Due to the participation of H2O, H-abstractions occur more frequently in the initial decomposition. Subsequent reactions of H2O with generated C10H19, C9H17, and C7H13 radicals, thereby effectively inhibit coke formation by decomposing those existing coking precursors and preventing their further chain-transfer reactions. Meanwhile, Species-dependent analysis on generation channels of CO and H2 suggest that reactions involving H2O also actively promote the conversion of less reactive C in the aromatic structure. This computational study could deepen the understanding of decomposition of aromatic isoprenoids during pyrolysis and SCWG process and offers potential solutions for enhancing the conversion efficiency of isoprenoid biofuels.
