You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanism of radical-mediated synergy in co-pyrolysis of oil shale and yak dung: experiments, kinetics and ReaxFF-MD simulations for cleaner energy production To address the energy shortage in remote pastoral areas and promote the sustainable use of resources, this study focuses on the co-pyrolysis of oil shale and yak manure. Comprehensive thermogravimetric analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TG-GC-MS), and reaction field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations revealed that mixing yak dung with oil shale significantly reduces the pyrolysis activation energy and promotes the decomposition of yak dung. Compared with yak dung alone, the initial and final pyrolysis temperatures were reduced by 23 °C and 8 °C, respectively. ReaxFF-MD confirmed that the mutual conversion of small molecule free radicals is the basis of the synergistic mechanism between yak dung and oil shale. The interaction between oxygen-rich biomass intermediates and oil shale hydrocarbon fragments inhibits the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), reducing sulfur-containing compounds by 67 % and increasing aliphatic hydrocarbon content by 6 %, aligning with carbon neutrality goals. The results demonstrate that the co-pyrolysis of oil shale and yak dung is a promising method for energy utilization. Our research provides a scalable solution for biomass conversion in remote pastoral areas with ecologically fragile environments and limited access to fossil fuels.
