Mechanism of radical-mediated synergy in co-pyrolysis of oil shale and yak dung: experiments, kinetics and ReaxFF-MD simulations for cleaner energy production To address the energy shortage in remote pastoral areas and promote the sustainable use of resources, this study focuses on the co-pyrolysis of oil shale and yak manure. Comprehensive thermogravimetric analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TG-GC-MS), and reaction field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) simulations revealed that mixing yak dung with oil shale significantly reduces the pyrolysis activation energy and promotes the decomposition of yak dung. Compared with yak dung alone, the initial and final pyrolysis temperatures were reduced by 23 °C and 8 °C, respectively. ReaxFF-MD confirmed that the mutual conversion of small molecule free radicals is the basis of the synergistic mechanism between yak dung and oil shale. The interaction between oxygen-rich biomass intermediates and oil shale hydrocarbon fragments inhibits the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), reducing sulfur-containing compounds by 67 % and increasing aliphatic hydrocarbon content by 6 %, aligning with carbon neutrality goals. The results demonstrate that the co-pyrolysis of oil shale and yak dung is a promising method for energy utilization. Our research provides a scalable solution for biomass conversion in remote pastoral areas with ecologically fragile environments and limited access to fossil fuels.
