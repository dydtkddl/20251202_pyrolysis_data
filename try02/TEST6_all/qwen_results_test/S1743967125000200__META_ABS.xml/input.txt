Different pretreatment of biomass for gasification: A critical review Biomass presents inherent challenges, including high oxygen content, low energy density, and logistical difficulties in transportation and storage. Furthermore, it undergoes adverse reactions during pyrolysis and gasification, such as ash accumulation, slagging, and corrosion, which compromise equipment efficiency. To augment the efficiency of biomass utilization and elevate the yield and quality of gasification products, pretreatment is essential. Specifically, mechanical methods adjust biomass's energy density, whereas microwave processing disrupts its cell wall structure via microwave radiation, enhancing microstructure porosity and decreasing crystallinity. Chemical treatments, utilizing reagents such as acids, bases, deionized water, organic solvents, and ionic liquids, modify cellulose crystallinity, lignin structure, biomass ash content, and regulate alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) levels. Physicochemical methods leverage high temperature, pressure, and chemical reagents' synergistic effects to facilitate changes in physical and chemical structures, thereby improving pretreatment and gasification efficiency. Biological pretreatment employs microorganisms or metabolically produced enzymes to modify biomass's physicochemical structure, enhancing gas productivity and lower heating value (LHV) for subsequent gasification while significantly minimizing tar production. Given the diversity and complex components of biomass, and their varying effects on gasification, selecting appropriate pretreatment methods tailored to specific biomass types is critical. This article provides a comprehensive summary of pretreatment technologies preceding biomass gasification, detailing their mechanisms, advancements, merits, and drawbacks. It also projects future research directions for gasification pretreatment, offering a theoretical foundation and guidance for forthcoming biomass gasification studies and industrial applications.
