You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Different pretreatment of biomass for gasification: A critical review Biomass presents inherent challenges, including high oxygen content, low energy density, and logistical difficulties in transportation and storage. Furthermore, it undergoes adverse reactions during pyrolysis and gasification, such as ash accumulation, slagging, and corrosion, which compromise equipment efficiency. To augment the efficiency of biomass utilization and elevate the yield and quality of gasification products, pretreatment is essential. Specifically, mechanical methods adjust biomass's energy density, whereas microwave processing disrupts its cell wall structure via microwave radiation, enhancing microstructure porosity and decreasing crystallinity. Chemical treatments, utilizing reagents such as acids, bases, deionized water, organic solvents, and ionic liquids, modify cellulose crystallinity, lignin structure, biomass ash content, and regulate alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) levels. Physicochemical methods leverage high temperature, pressure, and chemical reagents' synergistic effects to facilitate changes in physical and chemical structures, thereby improving pretreatment and gasification efficiency. Biological pretreatment employs microorganisms or metabolically produced enzymes to modify biomass's physicochemical structure, enhancing gas productivity and lower heating value (LHV) for subsequent gasification while significantly minimizing tar production. Given the diversity and complex components of biomass, and their varying effects on gasification, selecting appropriate pretreatment methods tailored to specific biomass types is critical. This article provides a comprehensive summary of pretreatment technologies preceding biomass gasification, detailing their mechanisms, advancements, merits, and drawbacks. It also projects future research directions for gasification pretreatment, offering a theoretical foundation and guidance for forthcoming biomass gasification studies and industrial applications.
