Ball-milled PET plastic char as an electron shuttle accelerated anaerobic degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in water environment 1 1 The number behind BMPC denotes the pyrolysis temperature. The combination of carbonaceous materials and microbial degradation is an attractive measure in improving the removal efficiency of organic pollutants in water environment. In this study, the anaerobic dechlorination in a coupled system of ball-milled plastic chars (BMPCs) and the microbial consortium were investigated. The anaerobic microorganism cultured from raw sludge (CAM) contributed to the dechlorination of the 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) into 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) as the final product via ortho-dechlorination in all testing groups. The dechlorination rate was accelerated in different BMBC plus CAM groups than that in only CAM group (0.048 d−1), of which, it was greater in BMPC-500 plus CAM group (0.375 d−1) than that in BMPC-700 plus CAM group (0.171 d−1). The electron exchange capacity (EEC) of BMPCs decreased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature (0.053 mmol e−/g for BMPC-500 and 0.037 mmol e−/g for BMPC-700), which directly affected anaerobic dechlorination. Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) of BMPCs also boosted the biogas yield by 1.5 times compared to that without BMPCs. Microbial community analysis illustrated that BMPCs helped to enrich the putative dechlorinating bacteria. The abundance of Clostridium_aenus_stricto_12, as a dominant dechlorinator, significantly increased from 0.02 % to 11.3 % (without BMPCs), 39.76 % (BMPC-500) and 9.3 % (BMPC-700), and followed by， Prevotella and Megaspheara, which was reported to take part in anaerobic dechlorination and digestion as H2 producers, also increased in the presence of BMPC. This study contributes to the realization of 2,4,6-TCP in-situ reduction technology and provides a scientific reference for anaerobic dechlorination by cultured anaerobes combined with BMPCs.
