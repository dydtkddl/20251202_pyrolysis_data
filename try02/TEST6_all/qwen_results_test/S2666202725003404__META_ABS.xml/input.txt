Inconel alloys: A comprehensive review of properties and advanced manufacturing techniques Inconel alloys, a family of high-performance nickel-based superalloys, are widely used in extreme engineering applications due to their exceptional strength, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability. This review highlights recent advancements in their properties, fabrication methods, and processing techniques. It explores the fundamental alloying mechanisms, microstructural evolution, and phase transformations that influence their mechanical behavior and durability. Key elements such as chromium, niobium, molybdenum, and titanium are examined for their roles in solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, and oxidation resistance. The review compares conventional manufacturing techniques such as casting, welding, and machining with advanced additive manufacturing (AM) processes, including Selective Laser Melting (SLM) and Laser Metal Deposition (LMD). It also discusses the influence of process parameters, residual stresses, and post-processing treatments on microstructural refinement and defect mitigation. Challenges such as phase instability, machining difficulties, and the effects of prolonged thermal exposure on fatigue performance are addressed. By integrating insights from metallurgy, manufacturing science, and mechanical performance, this review provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments and emerging trends in the processing and application of Inconel alloys.
