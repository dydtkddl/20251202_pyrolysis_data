You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of electronic waste and their mixtures: Kinetic and pyrolysate composition studies Electronic waste (e-waste) constitutes an important component of solid waste, and recovering valuable chemicals and resources from it holds a high priority in solid waste management. The various chemical functionalities present in the organic fraction of e-waste can be converted to valuable chemicals and fuel molecules by pyrolysis process. In this study, non-isothermal pyrolysis of waste printed circuit board (PCB), waste keyboard keys (KB), and their equal composition mixture is conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer at different heating rates. The kinetic analysis was carried out using isoconversional method of Vyazovkin and the multi-Gaussian distributed activation energy model (DAEM). The average apparent activation energies of pyrolysis of PCB, PCB: KB, and KB, determined using the Vyazovkin method, were 188.4, 167.6, and 169 kJ mol−1, respectively. The apparent activation energy determined using the DAEM varied in a wide range owing to the decomposition of multiple pseudo-components. Analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS) was used to identify the pyrolysates from PCB, KB, and their mixtures at 500 °C. The major pyrolysate functional groups from PCB were phenolic derivatives (36%), oxygenates (26%), and phenyl phosphates (14.4%), while KB pyrolysis yielded aromatics (52%) containing styrene as the major compound. Pyrolysis of mixtures resulted in a net increase in the selectivity to aromatics with a concomitant decrease in oxygenates suggesting dehydration and decarboxylation to be the major reactions. A significant amount of nitriles was produced from the pyrolysis of mixtures owing to the decomposition of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastic that constitutes KB.
