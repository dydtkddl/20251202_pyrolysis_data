You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Degradation of brominated flame-retarded plastics (Br-ABS and Br-HIPS) in supercritical water Two of the most commonly used brominated plastics in electrical and electronic goods, Br-ABS and Br-HIPS have been degraded in supercritical water up to 450°C and 31MPa in a batch Hastelloy-C reactor. The plastics were reacted both in the absence and presence of alkaline additives, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. The main reaction products were oils with near-zero bromine and antimony content in the presence of NaOH additive. The compositions of the oils were similar, comprising compounds like toluene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, cumene, butyl benzene, acetophenone, naphthalenes, phenylnaphthalenes, diphenylpropane, diphenylcyclopropane and a variety of multi-benzene compounds. Ethylbenzene was the predominant compound in the oils from both plastics. Phenols and substituted phenols were present in the oils from Br-ABS. Sodium hydroxide was more effective than Ca(OH)2 in the removal of organobromine compounds or in suppressing their formation in the oils. Up to 99wt% of the bromine atoms in the plastics was removed into the aqueous phase. Nearly, the entire antimony in the plastics was found in the solid residues obtained after the reactions. The NH3 and HBr released during the degradation of Br-ABS, reacted together forming ammonium bromide while keeping the reaction medium almost neutral. Carbon dioxide was the major component of the gas product from Br-ABS. In addition, both plastics produced hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases of which alkane gases were predominant.
