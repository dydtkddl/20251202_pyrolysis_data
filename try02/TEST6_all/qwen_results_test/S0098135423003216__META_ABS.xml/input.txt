Techno-economic analysis and process optimization of a PET chemical recycling process based on Bayesian optimization Chemical recycling has gained interest as a promising option to reduce the consumption of fossil feedstocks and relieve environmental issues concerning plastic waste. In this study, we present a preliminary techno-economic analysis of a process design for chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). A conceptual base case design was developed for a continuous catalytic PET depolymerization process. The process design was optimized to minimize total annualized cost (TAC) based on a simulation-based Bayesian optimization approach. A novel interface was utilized to manipulate the process variables, and to retrieve simulation and economic evaluation results. Through five trials of optimization, the process design was improved by about 4.2∼4.4 % in terms of TAC. Sensitivity analyses investigating the effect of process parameters and price variables on the minimum selling price of main product, p-xylene, are presented. The feedstock PET flake price was identified as the most critical factor affecting the economic viability of the process.
