AIEgen-caged ultrafast photochemical delivery and visualization of nitric oxide The development of bifunctional AIEgens for direct delivering and visualizing bioactive species together remains a great challenge to date. Herein, we fabricated a novel photoactivatable nitric oxide (NO) donor with a built-in AIE fluorophore, which can rapidly release NO and AIEgen upon light irradiation. The ultrafast NO generation can be obtained in 2.1 ps, with the yielding of a greatly drastic fluorescence turn-on AIEgen probe (300,000-fold intensity enhanced). Using this NO donor, real-time cell images of NO-releasing through the emission of AIEgen were successfully achieved through direct excitation of the donor in cells in situ.
