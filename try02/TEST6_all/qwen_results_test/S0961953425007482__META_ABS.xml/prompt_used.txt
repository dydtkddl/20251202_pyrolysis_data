You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the performance optimization and mechanism of Dawson-type P-W-V polyoxometalate catalyzed oxidative depolymerization of lignin to aromatic monomers Lignin is the most abundant renewable source of aromatic compounds in nature. However, its complex structure poses significant challenges for efficient depolymerization and catalyst design. In this study, a series of Dawson-type vanadium-substituted phosphotungstic polyoxometalates (POMs) were synthesized and used to catalyze the oxidative depolymerization of natural larch lignin to produce aromatic compounds. The reaction mechanism was investigated in depth. By adjusting the vanadium content, the acidity and oxidation ability of the catalyst were precisely controlled at the atomic level. The results showed that the vanadium content significantly affected the monomer yield. Under the optimal conditions (170 °C, 3 h, 1 MPa oxygen, catalyst-to-lignin ratio 1:1), H9P2W15V3O62 achieved the highest aromatic compound yield of 11.42 %, with the selectivity of vanillin and methyl vanillic acid reaching 93.5 %. During the reaction, the acidic and redox properties of POMs promoted the selective conversion of phenolic hydroxyl groups in lignin to carbonyl structures. This change altered the polarity of the Cα-Cβ bond, increased its reactivity, and facilitated bond cleavage. This work achieved precise control over the catalytic activity of POMs and enabled efficient and selective conversion of lignin into high-value phenolic compounds. Additionally, the mechanistic insights obtained in this study provide valuable theoretical and practical support for the high-value utilization of lignin and the development of a sustainable bioeconomy based on biomass resources, which is of significant scientific and economic importance for sustainable development.
