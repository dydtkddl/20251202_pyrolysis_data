Synergistic integration of biochar and graphene oxide in multi-functional composites: From sustainable synthesis to environmental remediation and energy storage Composite materials have gained significant attention due to their ability to combine distinct characteristics from two or more components, resulting in improved performance for various applications. This review paper examines the advancements made in the integration of two promising materials, biochar and graphene oxide (GO), in composite structures. Biochar, derived from biomass, offers unique physicochemical properties, while GO possesses a 2D structure with enhanced porosity and tunable electrical properties. However, there is a significant research gap in systematically understanding the combined effects of biochar and GO in composite materials, particularly concerning their synthesis techniques, environmental impact, and performance in diverse applications. This review addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art methodologies for synthesizing biochar-GO composites, their multifunctional properties, and their potential applications. Notably, biochar-GO composites exhibit exceptional efficiency in adsorbing heavy metal ions and organic contaminants due to their enhanced surface area and functional groups. The adsorption mechanisms involve a variety of physical and chemical interactions, leading to superior affinities compared to individual materials. Furthermore, biochar-GO composites demonstrate remarkable potential for utilization in electrochemical applications, serving as electrodes for supercapacitors and microbial fuel cells. These multifunctional materials show immense potential in tackling water pollution issues and promoting sustainable approaches. This review provides extensive insights into the synthesis techniques, properties, and applications of biochar-GO composites, highlighting their remarkable versatility as sustainable materials.
