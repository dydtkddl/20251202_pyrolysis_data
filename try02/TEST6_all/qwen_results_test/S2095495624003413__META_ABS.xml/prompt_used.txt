You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Brønsted-acid sites induced photocatalytic cracking of low-polarity polyethylene plastics Polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE) are one of the largest-scale synthetic plastics and play a key role in modern society. However, polyethylene is extremely inert to chemical recycling owing to its lack of chemical functionality and low polarity, making it one of the most challenging environmental hazards globally. Herein, we developed a phosphorylated CeO2 catalyst by an organophosphate precursor and featured efficient photocatalysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) without the acid or alkaline pre-treatment. Compared to pristine CeO2, the surface phosphorylation allows to introduce Brønsted acid sites, which facilitate to form carbonium ions on LDPE via protonation. In addition, the suitable band structure of the phosphorylated CeO2 catalyst enables efficient photoabsorption and generates reactive oxygen species, leading to the C–C bond cleavage of LDPE. As a result, the phosphorylated CeO2 catalyst exhibited an outstanding carbon conversion rate of >94% after 48 h of photocatalysis under 50 mW/cm2 of simulated sunlight, with a high CO2 product selectivity of >99%. Furthermore, the PE microparticles with sizes larger than 10 μm released from LDPE plastic wrap were directly and completely degraded by photocatalysis within 12 h, suggesting an attractive and environmentally benign strategy of utilizing solar energy-based photocatalysis for reducing potential hazards of LDPE plastic trashes.
