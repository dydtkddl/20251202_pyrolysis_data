Degradation of 1,4-dioxane by sono-activated persulfates for water and wastewater treatment applications This paper presents a hybrid advanced oxidation process (AOP) based on sonocavitational activation of persulfate (PS) for degradation of 1,4-dioxane during wastewater treatment. Application of sono-cavitation effectively convert PS to radical species demonstrating synergistic effect by increasing the reaction rate and reducing the required energy for activation. It is economically feasible and deployed alternative to the direct thermal activation method. A single and two-stage injection of PS were compared to eliminate self-scavenging effects related to excess of oxidant in system. A GC-MS analysis was used to determine the degradation products of dioxane and to propose the degradation mechanism. The studies revealed that the degradation was significantly enhanced by the addition of PS at molar ratio of oxidant to pollutant 4 with a two-stage injection. Under optimal conditions at US density of 105 W/cm2, dioxane with an initial concentration of 100 mg/L was completely degraded in 120 min.
