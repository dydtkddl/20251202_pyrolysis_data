You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Controlled pyrolysis of MIL-88A to prepare iron/carbon composites for synergistic persulfate oxidation of phenol: Catalytic performance and mechanism In this study, based on the extensive discussion of the phase transformation process of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)——MIL-88A(Fe) under thermal treatment, the catalytic performance of MIL-88A-derived iron/carbon (FexC) composites on persulfate (PS) activation for phenol degradation was investigated. FexC-600 (γ-Fe2O3/C) exhibited a superior catalytic activity on PS activation for phenol degradation due to higher carbon content, more sp2-hybridized structure, carbonyl group and defective sites in composites, in which 98.23% of phenol (20 mg/L) was degraded after 60 min with 0.3 g/L catalyst and 0.3 g/L PS at ambient pH (6.1). The phenol degradation experiments and mechanism studies revealed that there was a catalytic synergism between iron oxides and carbon component in FexC 400-600 composites. Moreover, sulfate radicals (SO4 −), hydroxyl radical (•OH), singlet oxygen (1O2) and interfacial electron transfer process all involved in the degradation of phenol by FexC 400-600 composites, but the 1O2-mediated non-radical oxidation was the dominant pathway rather than reactive radicals. Finally, the possible mechanism of PS activation on FexC 400-600 composites was proposed. This work discusses the synergistic catalytic mechanism of FexC composites on PS activation, and favors to provide a better understanding of the metal species and carbon component interaction in iron/carbon-based materials.
