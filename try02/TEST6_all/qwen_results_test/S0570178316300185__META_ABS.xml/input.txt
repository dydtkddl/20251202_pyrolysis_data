Influence of biochar and seaweed extract applications on growth, yield and mineral composition of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under sandy soil conditions Two pot experiments were conducted during 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 winter seasons to study the effect of biochar (BC) as soil amendments at two rates 2% and 5%, seaweed extract (SWE) as foliar applications at 1 and 2g/l and the combination between BC 2% and SWE treatments on growth, yield attributes and some macro- and micronutrients concentration in roots, leaves and grains of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Sakha 93. Two samples were taken at 105 and 150 days after sowing. At the first sample date, plant height, leaves number per main tiller, number of tillers/plant, shoot fresh weight, root length, root fresh weight, chlorophyll reading, spikes number per plant, main spike length and N, P, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu concentrations in roots and leaves were determined. At the second sample date (harvesting time), spike weight, number of grains per spike, weight of grains/spike and weight of 100 grains were recorded and nutrients concentrations in grains were determined. Obtained results revealed that, adding biochar, sprayed seaweed extract treatments individually or in combination have stimulating effect on the most of morphological characters and yield components as compared with control plants in both seasons. Generally, using the low level of BC at 2% individually or in combination with SWE treatments has more promotion effect on the most of growth parameters and yield components and achieved the highest concentrations on the most of macro- and micronutrients in roots, leaves and grains as compared with the control in both seasons.
