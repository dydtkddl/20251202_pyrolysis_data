  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The abstract discusses carbon monoxide formation in enclosure fires, focusing on pyrolysis of oxygenated polymers like wood, but does not involve plastic or polymer pyrolysis as defined, nor does it describe lab-scale experimental work with measurable yields or analytical characterization of plastic pyrolysis products."
