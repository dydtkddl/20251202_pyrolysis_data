You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The global equivalence ratio concept and the formation mechanisms of carbon monoxide in enclosure fires This report summarizes a large number of investigations designed to characterize the formation of carbon monoxide (CO) in enclosure fires—the most important factor in fire deaths. It includes a review analysis of the studies which form the basis for the global equivalence ratio (GER) concept. Past and very recent (some as yet unpublished) investigations of CO formation in enclosure fires are reviewed. Based on the findings, two completely new mechanisms for the formation of CO, in addition to the quenching of a fire plume by a rich upper layer, which is described by the GER concept, are identified. The first is the result of reaction between rich flame gases and air which is entrained directly into the upper layer of an enclosure fire. Detailed chemical-kinetic modeling studies have demonstrated that CO will be generated by these reactions. The second is due to the direct generation of CO during the pyrolysis of oxygenated polymers (such as wood) which are located in highly vitiated, high-temperature upper layers. The findings of these studies form the basis of an analysis that provides the guidelines for when the use of the GER concept is appropriate for predicting CO formation in enclosure fires. It is concluded that there are limited conditions for which such use is justified. Unfortunately, these conditions do not include the types of fires which are responsible for the majority of fire deaths in building fires.
