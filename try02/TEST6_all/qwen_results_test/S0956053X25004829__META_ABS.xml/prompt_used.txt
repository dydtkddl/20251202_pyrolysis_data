You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling polymeric wastes into multi-walled carbon nanotubes via dual-stage pyrolysis: advancing sustainable resource recovery The persistent accumulation of polymeric wastes, typically disposable face masks in cleanroom protocols, medical sectors and public health, presents a significant environmental challenge. This study explores the conversion of polymeric waste into valuable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through an integrated dual-stage pyrolysis system. The first stage featured the optimization of hydrocarbon gas from waste pyrolysis before sending for CNT production. It was conducted at 500 ℃ with a heating rate of 20 ℃/min to transform wastes into hydrocarbon gas. Ni was impregnated onto a ZSM-5 support in varying concentrations, with 5 % Ni/ZSM-5 achieving the highest hydrocarbon gas yield (47 wt%), including 79.1 % of C1–C3 hydrocarbons. The second stage highlighted the actual methane consumption for CNT formation and the optimum growth temperature. The C1–C3 hydrocarbons were channeled to the second stage to synthesize CNTs, aided by a NiMoCa catalyst. At 750 ℃, the actual methane consumption peaked at 22.7 %, resulting in CNTs with low defects (IG/ID = 2.1 and IG’/ID = 1.4) and a uniform diameter of 30–60 nm. With a precisely tuned gas composition and controlled production of CNTs with targeted quality, this system promotes the circular economy of upcycling polymeric waste into advanced resources.
