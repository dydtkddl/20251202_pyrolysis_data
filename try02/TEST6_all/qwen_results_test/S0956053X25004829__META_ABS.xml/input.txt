Upcycling polymeric wastes into multi-walled carbon nanotubes via dual-stage pyrolysis: advancing sustainable resource recovery The persistent accumulation of polymeric wastes, typically disposable face masks in cleanroom protocols, medical sectors and public health, presents a significant environmental challenge. This study explores the conversion of polymeric waste into valuable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through an integrated dual-stage pyrolysis system. The first stage featured the optimization of hydrocarbon gas from waste pyrolysis before sending for CNT production. It was conducted at 500 ℃ with a heating rate of 20 ℃/min to transform wastes into hydrocarbon gas. Ni was impregnated onto a ZSM-5 support in varying concentrations, with 5 % Ni/ZSM-5 achieving the highest hydrocarbon gas yield (47 wt%), including 79.1 % of C1–C3 hydrocarbons. The second stage highlighted the actual methane consumption for CNT formation and the optimum growth temperature. The C1–C3 hydrocarbons were channeled to the second stage to synthesize CNTs, aided by a NiMoCa catalyst. At 750 ℃, the actual methane consumption peaked at 22.7 %, resulting in CNTs with low defects (IG/ID = 2.1 and IG’/ID = 1.4) and a uniform diameter of 30–60 nm. With a precisely tuned gas composition and controlled production of CNTs with targeted quality, this system promotes the circular economy of upcycling polymeric waste into advanced resources.
