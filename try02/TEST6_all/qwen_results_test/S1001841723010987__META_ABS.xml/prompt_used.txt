You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in poly(heptazine imide)/poly(triazine imide) photocatalyst Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has garnered increasing attention as a metal-free photocatalyst with a suitable band gap. In efforts to enhance its photocatalytic performance, researchers have examined various PCN materials, including poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) and poly(triazine imide) (PTI), two isomers within the PCN family that exhibit distinct and superior photocatalytic activity compared to other forms. The challenge, however, lies in the common practice among researchers to categorize PHI and PTI along with other PCN types under the overarching term “g-C3N4,” which significantly impedes optimization efforts. The objective of this review is to provide comprehensive insights into the structural features, photoelectrochemical properties, and effective characterization methods employed for distinguishing between PHI and PTI materials. The review also summarizes various optimization strategies, such as crystallinity adjustments, defect engineering, morphology control, constructing heterojunction, and atomic-level metal loading dispersion, to elevate the photocatalytic activity of PHI and PTI, in addition to summarizing the history of carbon nitride development. Furthermore, this review highlights the primary applications of PHI and PTI, encompassing nitrogen fixation, biomass conversion, organic synthesis, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, H2O2 production, and photocatalytic water splitting. Lastly, the prospects and challenges associated with further advancing PHI and PTI are thoroughly examined.
