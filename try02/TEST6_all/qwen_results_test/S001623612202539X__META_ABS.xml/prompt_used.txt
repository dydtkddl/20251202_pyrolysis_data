You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of bio-oil/biodiesel production from co-pyrolysis of corn straw and natural hair: A new insight towards energy recovery and waste biorefinery The present study evaluated the total energy output and economic feasibility of biodiesel production coupled with value-added nitrogen-containing compounds (NCCs) through co-pyrolysis of low- and high-protein biowaste. Corn straw (CS) and human hair waste (HW) were used at different blend ratios of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, w/w. Individual pyrolysis of HW showed 20.7% higher bio-oil yield than CS due to higher volatiles in HW, while co-pyrolysis resulted in synergistic action which enhanced both bio-oil yield with higher fatty acids/esters proportion. The highest recorded bio-oil yield was 46.3% using 75% HW blend ratio, which showed insignificant difference with that of HW. In addition, co-pyrolysis resulted in reduction of NCCs by 13.7% comparing to HW, with simultaneous enhancement of fatty acids and esters contents by 67.8% and 13.2%, respectively. Therefore, transesterification of co-pyrolyzed bio-oil showed the highest biodiesel proportion of 20.7%, representing 4.7-times and 61.7% higher than CS and HW, respectively. In addition, transesterified co-pyrolyzed bio-oil showed 27.0% NCCs, which was 8.2-times higher than that of CS. Due to the higher calorific value of biodiesel compared to bio-oil, biodiesel of the co-pyrolyzed bio-oil showed the highest total energy output in the biorefinery route (3753 MJ/ton biomass), which was higher than the total energy output from the conventional route of bio-oil production from CS (3738 MJ/ton biomass). However, additional revenue of 39,860 US$/ton biomass was estimated in the biorefinery route due to NCCs fraction, which provides a new insight towards future industrial applications.
