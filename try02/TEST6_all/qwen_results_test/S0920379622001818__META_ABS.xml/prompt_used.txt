You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Brazing characteristics, microstructure, and wettability of laser powder bed fusion additive manufactured GRCop-84 compared to CuCrZr and OFC, and brazing to titanium-zirconium-molybdenum alloy limiters Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) of Glenn Research Copper 84 (GRCop-84), a Cr2Nb (8 at. % Cr, 4 at. % Nb) precipitation hardened alloy, produces a fully dense, high conductivity alloy with a yield strength of 500 MPa and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 740 MPa with 20% elongation; superior to other competing copper alloys. Braze wetting characteristics of GRCop-84 with Ag-Cu-X, and Au-Cu brazes were similar to CuCrZr, but less than oxygen free copper. No difference in wetting was observed between infill and surface contour areas in L-PBF GRCop-84. Wet sanding to 240 grit (Ra=0.24 µm) was considered the optimal surface condition. Silver diffusing through GRCop-84 depleted Cr2Nb precipitates from the copper grain and deposited agglomerations of coarsened precipitates within silver-rich regions of intergranular diffusion once a density threshold was reached. Microstructure modification was minimized with 50Au-50Cu braze implying that silver caused precipitate coarsening and agglomeration, and not high temperature exposure. Coarsened precipitates were observed on the surface within braze pools implying a contribution to braze wetting. Palcusil-25, Ticusil, CuSil-ABA, and 50Au-50Cu brazes were suitable for brazing to unplated Titanium-Zirconium-Molybdenum (TZM), while sulfamate nickel plating to allows wetting with CuSil or other non-active brazes. Vacuum brazing techniques were developed to join a 1 mm thick layer of TZM to the front of additive manufactured GRCop-84 waveguides considering the brazing characteristics of both GRCop-84, TZM, and internal stress from the difference in coefficient in thermal expansion.
