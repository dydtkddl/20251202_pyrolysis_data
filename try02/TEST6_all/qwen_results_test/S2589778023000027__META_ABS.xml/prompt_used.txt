You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthetic porous carbons for clean energy storage and conversion Synthetic porous carbons (SPCs) are important materials in fundamental research and industrial applications due to their diverse structures at different dimensions, intriguing physio-chemical properties, exceptional thermal and chemical stability, etc. In particular, the features including high electron conductivity, accessible active surface/interface, and developed porosity warrant their superior performances in clean energy storage and conversion. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in SPCs, serving as electrodes for this ever-increasing energy storage and conversion-related directions, e.g., supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, etc. We emphasized rational design and targeted synthesis of SPCs based on bottom-up strategy, the effective methods for precise tuning of their core parameters, and the disclosure of their structure-performance correlations. The challenges of fine-tuning surface chemistry by doping heteroatoms, engineering defective sites, and optimizing compositions are discussed, which could endow the SPCs with new functions and potential applications. Finally, we outlined the developing trend and design principle of the new generation of SPCs for clean energy storage and conversion. We expect that this review could inspire interdisciplinary activities between the synthesis, physical and chemical studies of SPCs and other potential applications in addition to energy storage and conversion.
