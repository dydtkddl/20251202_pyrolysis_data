You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A combined experimental and numerical investigation focusing on the effects of CH3 substituent on the PAH chemistry in the pyrolysis of cyclopentane and methylcyclopentane The combustion behavior of cycloalkanes has long fascinated researchers because their cyclic unique structural properties may significantly influence their reactivity and combustion kinetics. In order to achieve a better understanding of the kinetics of cycloalkanes during intermediate to high temperature combustion chemistry, the pyrolysis of cyclopentane (CP) and methylcyclopentane (MCP) was studied in a jet-stirred reactor (869–1210 K, 1 atm) to explore the impact of methyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation and combustion kinetics. Synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) identified monocyclic to polycyclic aromatics, including acenaphthylene, phenanthrene, and pyrene. A newly developed kinetic model, validated against experimental data, revealed distinct decomposition behaviors: MCP exhibited lower initial decomposition temperatures and faster formation of C1–C4 hydrocarbons and aromatics compared to CP. This is attributed to the methyl group’s lower energy barrier, enhancing MCP’s reactivity. While CP pyrolysis generated higher concentrations of 1,3-cyclopentadiene and resonance-stabilized C5 cyclic radicals, these intermediates did not notably elevate PAH levels. In contrast, MCP’s methyl side chain promoted earlier fuel breakdown and accelerated PAH/soot precursor formation via enhanced radical production and alkylation pathways. These findings highlight that methyl substitution in cycloalkanes lowers thermal stability, accelerates decomposition, and amplifies aromatic growth, emphasizing structural effects on combustion chemistry and pollutant formation. The study provides critical insights into fuel design and emission control strategies for cyclic hydrocarbons.
