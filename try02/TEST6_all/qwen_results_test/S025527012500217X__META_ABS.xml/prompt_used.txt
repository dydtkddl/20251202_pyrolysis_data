You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrified dehydrogenation of methyl-cyclohexane: reactor modeling and process integration Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) have been proposed as hydrogen transport technology to overcome limitations related to its low volumetric density. However, the dehydrogenation step represents the technological bottleneck of the LOHC storage cycle. In this work, a process layout based on the adoption of an electrified packed foam reactor for the dehydrogenation of the LOHC pair Methyl-cyclohexane/Toluene (MCH/TOL) is reported for an intensified CO2-free cycle. The effects on reactor performance of operating parameters such as Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV), outlet pressure, and inlet temperature are studied. The proposed reactor reaches volumetric hydrogen productivity, expressed in terms of H2 lower heating value of 3.18 k W H 2 − LHV L R − 1 with 95 % of MCH conversion, improving the results of intensified reactor configurations reported in the literature. The reactor is then integrated into a process layout considering a large-scale hydrogen refueling station as a case study, and process-related KPIs are calculated. The designed dehydrogenation process provides 1000 kg day-1 of hydrogen, with a purity of 99.8 %, and a specific consumption of 13.46 kWh kg H 2 − 1 This work represents the first application of an electrified packed-foam reactor to LOHC dehydrogenation and its integration in process simulation. It also potentially represents the starting point for future optimization studies to assess the competitiveness of this hydrogen transport technology.
