You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Overcoming the fluorescent interference during Raman spectroscopy detection of microplastics Owing to environmental concerns, microplastics pollution has been the object of increasing attention. Currently, the chemical composition of microplastics is commonly detected using Raman spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the Raman spectra of microplastics may be overlaid by signals derived from additives (e.g., pigment), resulting in serious interference. In this study, an efficient method is proposed to overcome the interference of fluorescence during Raman spectroscopic detection of microplastics. Four catalysts of Fenton's reagent (Fe2+, Fe3+, Fe3O4, and K2Fe4O7) have been investigated for their capacity to generate hydroxyl radical (•OH), thus potentially eliminating the fluorescent signals in microplastics. The results indicate that the Raman spectrum of microplastics treated with Fenton's reagent can be efficiently optimized in the absence of spectral processing. This method has been successfully applied to the detection of microplastics collected from mangroves, featuring a range of colours and shapes. Consequentially, after 14 h of treatment with sunlight-Fenton (Fe2+: 1 × 10–‍6 M, H2O2: 4 M), the Raman spectra matching-degree (RSMD) of all microplastics were >70.00 %. The innovative strategy discussed in this manuscript can greatly promote the application of Raman spectroscopy in the detection of real environmental microplastics, overcoming interfering signals derived from additives.
