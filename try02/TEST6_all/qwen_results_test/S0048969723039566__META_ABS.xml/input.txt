Overcoming the fluorescent interference during Raman spectroscopy detection of microplastics Owing to environmental concerns, microplastics pollution has been the object of increasing attention. Currently, the chemical composition of microplastics is commonly detected using Raman spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the Raman spectra of microplastics may be overlaid by signals derived from additives (e.g., pigment), resulting in serious interference. In this study, an efficient method is proposed to overcome the interference of fluorescence during Raman spectroscopic detection of microplastics. Four catalysts of Fenton's reagent (Fe2+, Fe3+, Fe3O4, and K2Fe4O7) have been investigated for their capacity to generate hydroxyl radical (•OH), thus potentially eliminating the fluorescent signals in microplastics. The results indicate that the Raman spectrum of microplastics treated with Fenton's reagent can be efficiently optimized in the absence of spectral processing. This method has been successfully applied to the detection of microplastics collected from mangroves, featuring a range of colours and shapes. Consequentially, after 14 h of treatment with sunlight-Fenton (Fe2+: 1 × 10–‍6 M, H2O2: 4 M), the Raman spectra matching-degree (RSMD) of all microplastics were >70.00 %. The innovative strategy discussed in this manuscript can greatly promote the application of Raman spectroscopy in the detection of real environmental microplastics, overcoming interfering signals derived from additives.
