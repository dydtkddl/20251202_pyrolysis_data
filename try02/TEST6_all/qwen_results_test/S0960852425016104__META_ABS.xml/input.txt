Enhanced methane yield from pistachio shells via a novel sodium perborate-based oxidative pretreatment and early prediction of methane yields using an ARIMA model Alkaline pretreatment is effective in enhancing methane (CH4) production from lignocellulosic biomass; however, conventional methods face environmental and economic challenges due to high chemical consumption and the generation of saline wastewater. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel synergistic sodium perborate (SPB)–alkaline (NaOH) pretreatment for enhanced anaerobic digestion (AD) of PS, a widely available lignocellulosic residue with a robust, lignin-rich structure that limits biodegradability. The proposed SPB–NaOH synergy is designed to disrupt the lignin barrier through a combination of saponification and oxidative cleavage, thereby enhancing carbohydrate accessibility. The combined pretreatment improved the CH4 yield by 12 % compared to NaOH alone, reaching 159.8 mL/g volatile solids. Time-series forecasting using the autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) model outperformed the modified Gompertz model for early-stage prediction, achieving reliable CH4 yield forecasts with less than 7.5 % prediction error when trained on only the first 20 days of data. These results highlight the technical potential of the SPB–NaOH pretreatment while underscoring the necessity for cost-effective oxidants or dosage optimization. Furthermore, ARIMA-based predictive modeling offers a robust framework for rapid evaluation of AD processes, enabling accurate yield estimation from truncated datasets and accelerating substrate and pretreatment screening. Future work should focus on techno-economic feasibility, including low-cost peroxygen alternatives and optimized chemical loading.
