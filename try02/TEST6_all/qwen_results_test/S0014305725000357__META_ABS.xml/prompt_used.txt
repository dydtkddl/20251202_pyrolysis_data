You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design and Diverse applications of versatile hierarchically highly porous PolyHIPEs towards promising substrates for site directed immunosensor In the recent years, solid foams synthesized from high internal phase emulsion HIPE, labelled as polyHIPEs, have attracted unprecedented attention since their first discovery in the 80 s. In principle, HIPEs are generated by mixing of two immiscible liquids with more than 74 % of internal phase in the presence of an adequate surfactant. Upon polymerization of the monomers in the external phase, polyHIPE with highly porous and rigid structure is formed. Accordingly, different classes of materials, ranging from co-polymers, interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN), or semi-IPN to inorganic decorated structures can be generated. It is worth noting that it is possible to transform on purpose such materials into porous and conductive carbon foams by pyrolysis. Moreover, as powerful improvement pathways in terms of selectivity and sensitivity, several approaches and procedures for immobilizing task-specific recognition functions as thin layer onto the surface of polyHIPE based materials have been used. This set of polyHIPE derived materials have been applied to a wide spectrum of applications, such as, separation and gas storage, catalysis and biomedical application among others. Via this review, our utmost aim is to highlight recent advancements in the understanding of different aspects of polyHIPE as promising sensing platforms for development of electrochemical sensors and biosensors.
