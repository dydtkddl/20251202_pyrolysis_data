You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green synthesis of highly pyrrolic nitrogen-doped biochar for enhanced tetracycline degradation: New insights from endogenous mineral components and organic nitrogen synergy The synthesis of efficient and environmentally friendly persulfate (PS) catalysts is currently a prominent research focus. This study employs single-step carbonization to investigate the interactions between endogenous mineral components (EMCs) and N-doping of nitrogen-rich biomass, aiming to design efficient biochar-based catalysts for enhanced tetracycline (TC) degradation. Biochars (PBC and SBC) derived from peanut hulls (PH) and soybean curd residue (SCR) with similar EMCs (ash ratio 16:19) but varying nitrogen content (1 % vs 1.53 %) were achieved, along with melamine-N-doped PBC (PBCN) for comparison under identical conditions. Physicochemical and quantum-chemistry analyses were conducted to investigate the synergistic effects between EMCs and organic-nitrogen in terms of morphological structures, active sites, and catalytic persulfate (PS)-mediated degradation of TC. The findings revealed that the optimal synthesis temperature for the efficient biochar-based catalyst was 800 °C. In contrast to exogenous N-doping with higher N-content (7.81 %), organic-N accelerated lattice disruption, leading to enhanced interactions with EMCs and resulting in the formation of hierarchical structures and pyrrole-N (organic-N 43.44 % > exogenous-N 17.67 %). The SBC/PS system exhibited superior degradation capability, with rapid removal of 95 % in 100 mg·L-1 TC. Density functional theory (DFT) confirmed that the non-radical pathways including 1O2 and electron transfer, facilitated by the presence of CO and pyrrole-N, were responsible for binding PS and forming biochar-PS*. This study furnishes both experimental data and theoretical insights, supporting the targeted control and efficient advancement of eco-friendly, high-value biochar-based catalysts.
