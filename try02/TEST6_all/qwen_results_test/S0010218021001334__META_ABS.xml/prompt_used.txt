You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on N-guanylurea-dinitramide (GUDN) decomposition using theoretical simulations, online photoionization mass spectrometry and TG-DSC-IR-MS experiments N-guanylurea-dinitramide (GUDN) has received widespread attention due to its high energy and low sensitivity. Research on thermal decomposition behavior of energetic materials plays an important role in their practical application. However, determining transition state products from an experimental technology remains a question to be solved. Herein, theoretical calculations (ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and DFT calculations) coupled with online photoionization mass spectrometry and TG-DSC-IR-MS were performed to elucidate the thermal decomposition mechanism of GUDN. The infrared peak evolution of condensed phase products is investigated by in situ IR spectroscopy. Molecular dynamics, DFT calculations and in situ IR results suggest that the first step of GUDN unimolecular decomposition is hydrogen transfer reaction, followed by the reaction between two amino groups on the hydrogen transfer product of guanylurea to lose NH3, and then the remaining structure break from the CN bond and finally decomposed into NCO and CN2H3 fragments. The major products of GUDN decomposition include CO2, N2, H2N2 and NH3, and the minor products are H2O and HN2. The products NO2, NO, and CO only participate in initial formation and intermediate conversion reactions. This work is helpful for understanding the entire decomposition process of GUDN with theoretical calculations and experimental methods.
