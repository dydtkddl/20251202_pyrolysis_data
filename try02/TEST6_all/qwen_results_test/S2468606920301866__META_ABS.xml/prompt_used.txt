You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particle atomic layer deposition as an effective way to enhance Li-S battery energy density Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the most promising candidates for succeeding lithium ion batteries. However, they present some challenges which should be faced to increase its commercial possibilities as detrimental mechanisms during operation (e.g. shuttle effect, low capacity retention, anode corrosion, and so on) and sulfur cathode processing limitations (e.g. poor mechanical stability of S cathodes, defects, low S loading, and so on). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) with alumina (Al2O3) has been extensively applied to sulfur cathode surfaces to improve the electrochemical behavior of Li-S technology as it minimizes discharge product dissolution and hence, it reduces detrimental mechanisms during operation. However, the improvement of sulfur cathode processing still remains unsolved even high-cost approaches have been proposed in the state of the art which unfortunately are not viable for realistic applications. In the present work, for first time, ALD in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) is carried out to coat sulfur-carbon (S/C) composite particles with Al2O3 before electrode manufacturing. The present approach provides a precise control of S/C composite agglomeration, which improves sulfur cathode processing while maintaining the well known satisfactory operational mechanisms related to Al2O3 coating. We reported on the economic FBR-ALD technique in a promising strategy for high specific energy density Li-S battery with an increased sulfur loading being, double of that obtained for a standard sulfur cathode (3.6 vs. 1.8 mgsulfur cm−2).
