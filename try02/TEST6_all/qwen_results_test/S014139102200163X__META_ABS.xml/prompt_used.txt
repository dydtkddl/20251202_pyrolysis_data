You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of waste polystyrene by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis: A description for different feedstocks, catalysts and operation modes Chemical recycling by thermo-catalytic pyrolysis/degradation offers the possibility of converting waste plastics into their original monomers or other valuable chemicals which can be used as feedstocks in chemical and petrochemical industries. Plastic wastes of polystyrene (PS) based materials can be a good source of styrene as well as mono-aromatic (BTEX: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) compounds. The selectivity of pyrolysis products can be tuned by choosing the right catalyst as well as appropriate operating conditions/operation modes. In this regard, the focus of the present work was to perform thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of different waste polystyrene (WPS) feedstocks over acid and base catalysts employed in ex-situ and in-situ modes. The main goal was to compare the compositions of pyrolysis products obtained by changing feedstocks, catalysts and operation modes. A further goal was to discuss the suitability of the catalysts employed for the enhanced recovery of desired products from WPS pyrolysis. It was demonstrated that expanded polystyrene gives very similar product distribution as compared to virgin PS, both giving high styrene content. Likewise, hard PS-based random packing materials produce similar results as compared to high impact polystyrene (HIPS). Moreover, it was shown that solid base catalysts influence the composition of the pyrolysis products only slightly as compared to thermolysis. Solid acid catalyst however, showed significant impact on the composition of the pyrolysis products as compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. These results may provide new insights for the chemical recycling of plastic wastes.
