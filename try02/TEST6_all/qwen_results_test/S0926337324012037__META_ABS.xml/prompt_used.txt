You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Asymmetric high-coordination Co-NSP single-atom catalysts with tailored d-p-orbital electron structure for efficient bifunctional catalyst of rechargeable Zn-air battery cathodes Precise manipulation of the multiple heteroatoms coordination environment is crucial to maximize the catalytic performance of single atoms catalysts (SACs). However, the mechanisms regulating the relationship between the coordination environment and catalytic performance remain inadequately validated. Here, we synthesized a N,P,S co-coordinated hollow porous single-atom cobalt catalyst (Co-NSP-HPC) and proposed a facile strategy to fine-tune the first coordination shell to construct asymmetric high-coordination structures. Co-NSP-HPC exhibits a higher half-wave potential (0.898 V) and enhanced kinetic current density (33 mA cm−2), outperforming commercial Pt/C catalysts. Theoretical calculations indicate that the interaction between the first coordination shell (N3S) and axial P leads to robust, well-distributed Co sites with optimized electronic structures, promoting d-p orbital hybridization between Co and O atoms and the negative shift of the d-band center, which optimizes the adsorption free energy of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) intermediates. Furthermore, the hollow porous structure modulates the local environment, effectively exposing active sites and enhancing ORR kinetics. Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) based on Co-NSP-HPC cathodes exhibit high and stable open-circuit voltages (1.49 V) and maximum power densities (183.07 mW cm−2). This work will enrich the design philosophy of modulating the coordination environment of electrocatalysts for advanced Zinc-air batteries and beyond.
