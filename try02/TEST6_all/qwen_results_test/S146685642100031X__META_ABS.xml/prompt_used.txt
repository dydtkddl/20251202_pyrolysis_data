You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dielectric barrier discharge and radio-frequency plasma effect on structural properties of starches with different amylose content The effect of the dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric (DBD) and radio-frequency (RF) cold plasma treatment on the morphology, helical order, and structural stability of starches with different amylose content (30, 50, & 70%) was investigated. The cavities formed after RF plasma treatment allowed the active species to modify the internal structure of the granule, probably reaching its center and expanding to the periphery, where the amorphous regions were damaged and gradually removed by the treatment, increasing the amylose helix order and thermal stability of starch molecule as suggested by the SEM, FTIR, DSC, and TGA analysis. In contrast, DBD treatment promoted a thicker coating deposition and HMDSO functional groups inclusion, which increased both the granular interaction and the decomposition temperature. Overall, active species of HMDSO plasma generated in RF and DBD reactors modified mainly the amylose chains in a distinctive way, favoring the ordering or stability of starch molecules, respectively. These findings could be useful when looking for potential applications in the food industry or in other fields like semiconductors. Industrial relevance Atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and radio-frequency (RF) plasma are sustainable and quick methods to modify the structural properties of corn starch. After short-time treatments (10 min) both reactors change the granule surface (HMDSO coating and holes), which resulted in structural changes at different extent, such as increase of helical order and high thermal stability. These results showed that the DBD and RF treatments are suitable methods to obtain starches with high resistance to gelatinization (≈91 °C), especially those with high amylose content; however, due to their distinctive properties, they could have different end uses. DBD treated starch with HMDSO chemical group incorporation could be used in the paper, packaging, and electronic industry. Although HMDSO plasma is not yet approved for food industry, the results of FTIR confirmed that RF plasma treatment does not incorporate new elements in the starch molecules but only promoted interactions between them. Therefore, HDMSO plasma treatment could be considered as a safe and chemical-residue free technique useful to modify starches, which can be explored in food matrices development. Furthermore, they could be employed in an industrial food process that involves the use of high temperature.
