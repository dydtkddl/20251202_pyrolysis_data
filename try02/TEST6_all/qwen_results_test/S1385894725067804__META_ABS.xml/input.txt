Organic complexing groups and processes for the selective recovery of lithium from lithium-ion battery leachates: A review This review aims at shedding some light on promising solutions for the recycling of lithium from wasted lithium-ion batteries. The use of Lithium-selective inorganic materials is described but is limited by synthesis and stability issues (energy-consuming and high-temperature synthesis, and degradation observed at low pH). Organic molecules that are capable of both selectively and efficiently interacting, as well as bonding with lithium ions have been abundantly reported in the literature over the past decades. They have various advantages such as mild-condition synthesis, great adaptability and easy processing. This manuscript highlights the numerous lithium-selective organic complexing groups that are reported in the literature, as well as different process designs in which they can be implemented. Firstly, the pre-treatment of used lithium-ion batteries and production of leachates is described. A study of the complexation selectivity and efficiency of organic complexing groups as well as complexation mechanisms and influence of experimental conditions are reported. Then, a comparison of different process designs for the recovery of lithium from aqueous solutions is given. Finally, decomplexation, recovery and reuse of the complexing materials are described along with the perspectives of promising opportunities for the future of the recycling industry.
