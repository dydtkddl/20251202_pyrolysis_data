You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Organic complexing groups and processes for the selective recovery of lithium from lithium-ion battery leachates: A review This review aims at shedding some light on promising solutions for the recycling of lithium from wasted lithium-ion batteries. The use of Lithium-selective inorganic materials is described but is limited by synthesis and stability issues (energy-consuming and high-temperature synthesis, and degradation observed at low pH). Organic molecules that are capable of both selectively and efficiently interacting, as well as bonding with lithium ions have been abundantly reported in the literature over the past decades. They have various advantages such as mild-condition synthesis, great adaptability and easy processing. This manuscript highlights the numerous lithium-selective organic complexing groups that are reported in the literature, as well as different process designs in which they can be implemented. Firstly, the pre-treatment of used lithium-ion batteries and production of leachates is described. A study of the complexation selectivity and efficiency of organic complexing groups as well as complexation mechanisms and influence of experimental conditions are reported. Then, a comparison of different process designs for the recovery of lithium from aqueous solutions is given. Finally, decomplexation, recovery and reuse of the complexing materials are described along with the perspectives of promising opportunities for the future of the recycling industry.
