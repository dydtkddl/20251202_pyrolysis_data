A review on sustainable graphene production from rice husks: Strategies and key considerations In this review, the history of the graphene and their excellent structure and properties were briefly explained. The form of graphene in different allotropes and derivatives were also discussed as each type possessed different structures and properties, that were important in specific applications depending the quality of the produced graphene. On top of that, the main sustainability issues arise in the different synthesis methods for fabrication of graphene and graphene-based materials were discussed and reviewed. This review also focused in finding the cost-efficient, environmental-friendly, energy efficient, and low carbon footprint graphene precursors as an insight for potential development of sustainable graphene materials. Rice husk as an abundant and cheap lignocellulosic biomass wastes with high content of cellulose is a great candidate for sustainable graphene precursor. The excellent morphological structure, physicochemical, thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of rice husks-derived graphene for utilization in wide-range of applications were discussed. This review also concluded on the future insights and perspectives of the rice husk-derived graphene.
