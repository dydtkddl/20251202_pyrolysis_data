You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis technology for enhancing the functionality of sewage sludge biochar and immobilizing heavy metals Sewage sludge (SS) is a frequent and challenging issue for countries with big populations, due to its massive output, significant hazard potential, and challenging resource utilization. Pyrolysis can simultaneously realize the reduction, harmlessness and recycling of SS. Co-pyrolysis offers a wide range of potential in terms of increasing product quality and immobilizing heavy metals (HMs), thanks to its capacity to use additives to address the mismatch between SS characteristics and pyrolysis. High-value utilization potential of SS biochar is the key to evaluating the advancement of treatment technology. A further requirement for using biochar resources is the immobilization and bioavailability reduction of HMs. Due to the catalytic and synergistic effects in the co-pyrolysis process, co-pyrolysis SS biochar exhibits enhanced functionality and has been applied in soil improvement, pollutant adsorption and catalytic reactions. This review focuses on the research progress of different additives in improving the functionality of biochar and influencing the behavior of HMs. The key limitation and challenges in SS co-pyrolysis are then discussed. Future research prospects are detailed from seven perspectives, including pyrolysis process optimization, co-pyrolysis additive selection, catalytic mechanism research of process and product, biochar performance improvement and application field expansion, cooperative immobilization of HMs, and life cycle assessment. This review will offer recommendations and direction for future research paths, while also assist pertinent researchers in swiftly understanding the current state of SS pyrolysis research field.
