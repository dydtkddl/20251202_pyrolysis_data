Biocatalytic production of biolubricants: Strategies, problems and future trends The increasing worries by the inadequate use of energy and the preservation of nature are promoting an increasing interest in the production of biolubricants. After discussing the necessity of producing biolubricants, this review focuses on the production of these interesting molecules through the use of lipases, discussing the different possibilities (esterification of free fatty acids, hydroesterification or transesterification of oils and fats, transesterification of biodiesel with more adequate alcohols, estolides production, modification of fatty acids). The utilization of discarded substrates has special interest due to the double positive ecological impact (e.g., oil distillated, overused oils). Pros and cons of all these possibilities, together with general considerations to optimize the different processes will be outlined. Some possibilities to overcome some of the problems detected in the production of these interesting compounds will be also discussed.
