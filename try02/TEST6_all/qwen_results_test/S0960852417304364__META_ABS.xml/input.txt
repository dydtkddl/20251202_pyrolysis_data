Evaluation of correlation between glucan conversion and degree of delignification depending on pretreatment strategies using Jabon Merah The main purpose of this study was to investigate the glucan conversion rate after enzymatic hydrolysis depending on the treatment methods and conditions with changes in the chemical composition of treated solid fraction of Jabon Merah. The glucan conversion rate (17.4%) was not significantly improved after liquid hot water treatment (1st step) even though most of the hemicellulose was dissolved into liquid hydrolysate. Subsequently, dilute acid, organosolv, and peracetic acid treatment (2nd step) was conducted under various conditions to enhance glucan conversion. Among the 2nd step treatment, the glucan conversion rate of organosolv (max. 46.0%) and peracetic acid treatment (max. 65.9%) was increased remarkably through decomposition of acid-insoluble lignin (AIL). Finally, the glucan conversion rate and AIL content were highly correlated, which was revealed by the R-squared value (0.84), but inhibitory factors including cellulose crystallinity must be considered for advanced glucan conversion from highly recalcitrant biomasses, such as Jabon Merah.
