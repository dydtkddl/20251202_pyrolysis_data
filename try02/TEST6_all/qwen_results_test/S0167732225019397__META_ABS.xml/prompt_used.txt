You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Inhibition mechanism of spontaneous combustion in oil tank sulfur corrosion products based on ionic liquids desulfurization: Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation The active organic sulfur increases the likelihood of spontaneous combustion of oil tank and environmental pollution. To better prevent such issues, this study investigates the inhibition of spontaneous combustion in oil tank sulfur corrosion products through the removal of organic sulfur. From both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives, we examine the effectiveness of three ionic liquids—1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate—in desulfurization and their ability to inhibit spontaneous combustion in oil tank sulfur corrosion products. Scanning electron microscopy, simultaneous thermal analysis, and kinetic modeling were employed to analyze changes in surface morphology, oxidative characteristics, and reaction mechanisms before and after ionic liquids treatment. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations using Materials Studio software were conducted to study the adsorption behavior of organic sulfur compounds on iron sulfide surfaces under different conditions. The results demonstrated that ionic liquids treatment significantly delayed the oxidation of iron sulfide compounds, with the extrapolated onset temperature of high-temperature oxidation increasing from 851.67 K (control) to 888.41 K for 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate-treated samples. The corresponding oxidation peak temperature rose from 902.93 K to 936.57 K. Furthermore, the apparent activation energy increased from 189.87 kJ mol−1 in the control group to 218.81 kJ mol−1 after 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate treatment, indicating a notable suppression of spontaneous combustion. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the binding energies of n-butyl sulfide and dibenzothiophene on FeS surfaces decreased by 30.29 % and 39.05 %, respectively, after ionic liquids addition. These findings suggest that ionic liquids improve thermal stability and inhibit the catalytic role of organic sulfur in promoting combustion. Overall, this study not only provides theoretical insights into desulfurization-based inhibition mechanisms but also contributes to safer storage of petroleum products, reduction of fire and explosion risks, and protection of environmental and public safety at a societal level.
