You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of active hydrogen and oxygen on organic sulfur transformation behavior during pyrolysis of high sulfur coal: A review With consumption of high quality coal resources, clean and efficient conversion of high sulfur coal has attracted much attention, and especially the regulation of organic sulfur in high sulfur coking coal is very important. During pyrolysis transformation of organic sulfur in coal begins with cleavage of C–S bonds in the macromolecular structure of coal and stabilization of sulfur-containing free radicals, and active hydrogen/oxygen is an important factor affecting the transformation behavior of organic sulfur. It is found that, during coal pyrolysis under hydrogen-enriched or oxygen-enriched atmosphere or co-pyrolysis with biomass or oxygen-containing organic matter, the active hydrogen/oxygen in the system can weaken C–S bonds of organic sulfur, and promote their cleavage, timely combination with the generated sulfur-containing free radicals. This can promote sulfur in coal transform to the gas phase and reduce the secondary reaction of sulfur-containing free radicals with coal matrix. At the same time, during co-pyrolysis of high volatile and high sulfur coals, the relatively abundant active hydrogen/oxygen in volatile will also affect the organic sulfur transformation behavior in high sulfur coal, and reduce the sulfur content in coke, which provides a theoretical basis for directional regulation of sulfur in coal.
