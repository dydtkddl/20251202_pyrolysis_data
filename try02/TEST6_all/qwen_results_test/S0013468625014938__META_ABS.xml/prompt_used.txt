You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In situ growth of carbon nanotubes in enzymatic hydrolysis lignin-derived carbon for enhancing supercapacitor performance Lignin-derived carbon, with its low cost, natural porous structure, environmental friendliness, and tunable electrochemical properties, has emerged as an ideal candidate for supercapacitor electrodes. However, the insufficient proportion of mesopores and low electrical conductivity inevitably lead to low rate capability and power density. In this paper, lignin-derived carbon was prepared using enzymatic hydrolysis lignin, a solid residue from the bioethanol industry, as the primary raw material. Subsequently, carbon nanotubes were grown in situ by mobile chemical vapor deposition to prepare lignin-based carbon nanotube/carbon (L-CNT/C) in situ nanohybrid materials. The in situ grown carbon nanotubes endow the material with a higher mesopore fraction and enhanced conductivity. The higher mesoporosity facilitates the diffusion of electrolyte ions, thereby improving the capacitive rate performance. Compared to the 23.69 % retention rate of lignin-based carbon materials, the nanohybrid material still maintains a 57.09 % capacity at a current density that is 20 times higher. A high power density of 552.5 W kg⁻¹ is achieved at an energy density of 59.7 Wh kg⁻¹. After 12000 cycles, the material retains 88.2 % of its initial capacitance. This study provides a novel strategy for enhancing the rate performance and power density of electrode materials.
