In situ growth of carbon nanotubes in enzymatic hydrolysis lignin-derived carbon for enhancing supercapacitor performance Lignin-derived carbon, with its low cost, natural porous structure, environmental friendliness, and tunable electrochemical properties, has emerged as an ideal candidate for supercapacitor electrodes. However, the insufficient proportion of mesopores and low electrical conductivity inevitably lead to low rate capability and power density. In this paper, lignin-derived carbon was prepared using enzymatic hydrolysis lignin, a solid residue from the bioethanol industry, as the primary raw material. Subsequently, carbon nanotubes were grown in situ by mobile chemical vapor deposition to prepare lignin-based carbon nanotube/carbon (L-CNT/C) in situ nanohybrid materials. The in situ grown carbon nanotubes endow the material with a higher mesopore fraction and enhanced conductivity. The higher mesoporosity facilitates the diffusion of electrolyte ions, thereby improving the capacitive rate performance. Compared to the 23.69 % retention rate of lignin-based carbon materials, the nanohybrid material still maintains a 57.09 % capacity at a current density that is 20 times higher. A high power density of 552.5 W kg⁻¹ is achieved at an energy density of 59.7 Wh kg⁻¹. After 12000 cycles, the material retains 88.2 % of its initial capacitance. This study provides a novel strategy for enhancing the rate performance and power density of electrode materials.
