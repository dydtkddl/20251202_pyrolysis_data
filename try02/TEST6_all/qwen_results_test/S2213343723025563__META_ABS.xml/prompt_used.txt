You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of temperature on product properties and synergies during the co-pyrolysis of paper sludge and corn stover Paper sludge (PS), a by-product of paper mill wastewater treatment, has attracted increasing attention due to the dual nature of resources and pollution. This study focused on investigating the effect of temperature on the product properties and synergies of the co-pyrolysis process involving PS and corn stover (CS) using a fixed bed reactor. The results showed that co-pyrolysis led to an increase in the production of bio-oil, while reducing the formation of char and gases. Notably, the most significant synergistic effect was observed at 600 °C, where the experimental bio-oil yield surpassed the calculated value by 8.9%. At temperatures below 500 °C, ketones, aldehydes, and acids were the predominant products in the co-pyrolysis, which shifted towards phenols and aromatics as the temperature increased. Moreover, a promotion of CO content and an inhibition of CO2 content with temperature were also observed during co-pyrolysis, suggesting that higher temperatures facilitated synergistic decarbonylation. The co-pyrolysis biochar exhibited a higher abundance of carbonyl and alkyl groups compared to the biochar derived from PS pyrolysis, and the synergistic effect at higher temperatures promoted the development of micropores within the co-pyrolysis biochar. These findings emphasize the temperature-dependent nature of the co-pyrolysis process, offering valuable insights into the potential resource utilization of PS and CS wastes.
