You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Intermediate-mediated strategy to horn-like hollow mesoporous ultrathin g-C3N4 tube with spatial anisotropic charge separation for superior photocatalytic H2 evolution Metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has triggered huge interests for converting solar energy into fuels. However, direct-calcination derived bulk g-C3N4 always suffers from low surface area and high recombination of charge carriers, prompting attempts to foster g-C3N4 nano/microstructures to achieve high performance. Conventional routes, like templating method, always yields g-C3N4 with tedious morphology and requires post-treatment. Here we release the first report on development of horn-like hollow mesoporous ultrathin (HHMU) g-C3N4 tubes via first forming a horn-like Br-containing intermediate followed by further decomposition transformation under co-pyrolysis of melamine and substantial NH4Br. The multiple-superiorities achieved here (hollow/mesoporous/ultrathin/horn-like) allows g-C3N4 high surface area, drastically boosted bulk charge separation, carrier density and surface charge transfer efficiency. This advanced g-C3N4 thus casts outstanding photocatalytic performance for H2 evolution with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 14.3% at 420 ± 15nm, far exceeding most of reported g-C3N4. HHMU g-C3N4 also delivers a strengthened photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity into CO and CH4. Selective photo-deposition results provide an in-depth insight into charge movement behavior and high photo-reactivity that the photo-generated electrons migrate to the outer shell and holes prefer to transfer onto the inner shell of HHMU g-C3N4 tubes, thus achieving efficient spatial anisotropic charge separation. The current study may furnish a reference towards developing efficient tactics for integrally advancing g-C3N4 for renewable energy generation, and disclose a new perspective into promoting charge separation via microstructure design.
