You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-oil production from waste plant seeds biomass as pyrolytic lignocellulosic feedstock and its improvement for energy potential: A review In the search for an eco-friendly fuel, bio-oil is a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its potential to reduce environmental impacts and its versatility in various applications. According to the International Energy Agency, biofuel demand will increase by 41 billion liters, or 28%, between 2021 and 2026. About 5% of the primary energy in the United States in 2021 came from biomass resources, producing nearly 5,000 trillion BTU. However, a major challenge facing bio-oil production is the limited lignocellulosic biomass resources as feedstock and the costly supply chain. Non-edible plant seeds are abundant as fruity plants and yield bio-oil with good heating values, but they are yet to get the required attention. They are usually discarded after consuming their mesocarp, contributing to environmental waste. Also, bio-oil requires improvement due to various issues like strong corrosive effects, high acidity, and a high water content. This review, therefore, provides an overview of the bio-oil from waste plant seeds as lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks for producing biofuel using pyrolysis. The findings reveal an average 47.85% bio-oil yield from plant seeds with more bioenergy value than that from other tree parts' biomass resources; it can be upgraded using catalytic, co-pyrolysis, and distillation improvement approaches for its potential usage as an energy source. This highlight also provides the future and challenges of using this bio-oil as an alternative energy source, presenting a clean and affordable biofuel production feedstock that can mitigate climate change through a cleaner environment, plus new ways of recycling waste.
