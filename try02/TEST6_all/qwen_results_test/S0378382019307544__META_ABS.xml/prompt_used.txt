You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study of the characteristics and fluorescent properties of three different biochar derived‑carbonaceous nanomaterials for bioimaging and heavy metal ions sensing Three types of biochar (microalgae, rice straw and sorghum straw) from biomass thermal conversion production were tested for producing biochar-derived carbonaceous nanomaterials (BCN). BCN were obtained after using chemical depolymerisation and solvent extraction, NanoRefinery process. Microalgae biochar-derived carbonaceous nanomaterials (MAB-CN), rice straw biochar-derived carbonaceous nanomaterials (RSB-CN) and sorghum straw biochar-derived carbonaceous nanomaterials (SSB-CN) were characterised using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. This characterisation evidenced significant differences among the three BCN with MAB-CN exhibiting greater structural differences compared to RSB-CN and SSB-CN. Biocompatibility, cellular uptake, and cellular localisation were evaluated using three yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Yarrowia lipolytica. While all BCN were biocompatible, the degree of biocompatibility for each species was dependent on pH, BCN concentration and BCN type. Additionally, BCN were evaluated as transducers for the detection of 12 heavy metal ions. MAB-CN, RSB-CN, and SSB-CN had different responses to the 12 heavy metal ions. The SSB-CN/Cu (II) and the MAB-CN/Zn (II) combinations evidenced selectivity over the other metal ions with these combinations having limits of detection of 0.0125 μM and 9 μM, respectively. The results from this research pave the way for BCN novel applications for bioimaging and heavy metal ions sensing probes.
