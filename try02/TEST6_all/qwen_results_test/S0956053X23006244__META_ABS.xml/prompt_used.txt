You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvothermal liquefaction of Tetra Pak waste into biofuels and Al2O3-carbon nanocomposite This study explores a novel solvothermal disposal technique of Tetra Pak waste for the co-synthesis of value-added bio-oil and alumina-carbon nanocomposite. The impact of residence time (10–50 min.), temperature (240–360 °C), and substrate-to-solvent ratio (1:4–1:10) on the solvothermal liquefaction of Tetra Pak waste with supercritical ethanol were investigated on a batch scale. Initially rise in operating temperature and residence time positively influenced the bio-oil yield. However, a decline in yield was seen beyond a certain point. A higher substrate-to-solvent ratio enhanced the bio-oil yield as the solvent demonstrated its effective capabilities to depolymerize the feedstock. The favorable condition for the highest bio-oil yield (34.41 %) and HHV (30.51 MJ/Kg) were found to be at 320 °C, 30 min, and a substrate-to-solvent ratio of 1:10. The synergetic effect of solvent (ethanol) and aluminium present in Tetra Pak leads to the formation of in-situ generated active hydrogen that enhances the bio-oil yields and inhibits residue formation. XRD and XPS analysis confirms the transformation of aluminium from (Al (0)) to (Al (+3)) in the presence of ethanol forming in-situ generated alumina-carbon nanocomposite that has the potential to be used as a catalyst. NMR, GC–MS, and FTIR analysis confirmed the richness of bio-oil in various organic compounds including alcohol, esters, ketones, ethers, acids, and phenols. The recovered ethanol from the process exhibits a significant potential to be reused as a solvent or as a fuel additive.
