Development of MXene based organic polymer nanocomposites as highly efficient Electromagnetic Interference Shielding materials: A review The rapid expansion of electronic devices and wireless communication technologies has significantly increased the demand for high performance electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. MXene-based organic polymer nanocomposites have emerged as promising candidates due to their exceptional features including high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and lightweight properties. This review examines the synthesis and properties of MXenes, particularly their layered structure and multifunctionality, and explores various fabrication methods for MXene/polymer EMI shielding nanocomposites. The advantages and limitations of these methods in EMI applications are critically analysed. Additionally, structural characteristics, including morphology and interface interactions, are discussed to assess the dispersion and stability of MXene within polymer matrices. Key factors influencing shielding effectiveness (SE), such as MXene content, polymer type, and composite thickness, are investigated, along with the fundamental mechanisms governing EMI shielding in these nanocomposites. The contributions of total electromagnetic wave attenuation (SET), including absorption (SEA), reflection (SER), and multiple reflections (SEM), are examined in relation to optimal shielding mechanisms. A comparative analysis with other EMI shielding materials highlights the superior mechanical robustness, flexibility, and processability of MXene/polymer nanocomposites. Finally, the review outlines potential applications in flexible electronics, aerospace, medical, and wearable devices, emphasizing the need for further research on scalability, oxidation resistance, and environmental sustainability. It also addresses current challenges in EMI shielding applications and proposes innovative strategies for developing advanced EMI shielding materials.
