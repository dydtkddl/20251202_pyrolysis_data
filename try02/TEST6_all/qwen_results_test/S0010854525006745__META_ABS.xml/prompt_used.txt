You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of MXene based organic polymer nanocomposites as highly efficient Electromagnetic Interference Shielding materials: A review The rapid expansion of electronic devices and wireless communication technologies has significantly increased the demand for high performance electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. MXene-based organic polymer nanocomposites have emerged as promising candidates due to their exceptional features including high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and lightweight properties. This review examines the synthesis and properties of MXenes, particularly their layered structure and multifunctionality, and explores various fabrication methods for MXene/polymer EMI shielding nanocomposites. The advantages and limitations of these methods in EMI applications are critically analysed. Additionally, structural characteristics, including morphology and interface interactions, are discussed to assess the dispersion and stability of MXene within polymer matrices. Key factors influencing shielding effectiveness (SE), such as MXene content, polymer type, and composite thickness, are investigated, along with the fundamental mechanisms governing EMI shielding in these nanocomposites. The contributions of total electromagnetic wave attenuation (SET), including absorption (SEA), reflection (SER), and multiple reflections (SEM), are examined in relation to optimal shielding mechanisms. A comparative analysis with other EMI shielding materials highlights the superior mechanical robustness, flexibility, and processability of MXene/polymer nanocomposites. Finally, the review outlines potential applications in flexible electronics, aerospace, medical, and wearable devices, emphasizing the need for further research on scalability, oxidation resistance, and environmental sustainability. It also addresses current challenges in EMI shielding applications and proposes innovative strategies for developing advanced EMI shielding materials.
