You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovering precious metals from proton exchange membrane fuel cells for catalytic application in the thermo-chemical processing of plastic waste Platinum (Pt) serves as a catalyst in proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Owing to its value, recovery of Pt from PEMFC was motivated. Pt was retrieved as a Pt/C composite through the pyrolysis of a mixed matrix of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and a sub-gasket (SG), as part of an environmentally benign methodology. The Pt/C composite was harnessed as a catalyst for the pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP) using CO2 as the reaction medium. Both the one- and two-stage pyrolysis of PP yielded hydrocarbons (HCs) with methyl groups. However, the efficacy of CO2 remains inconclusive for both processes. Upon integration of Pt/C as a catalyst in PP pyrolysis, the chemical species were altered. The major constituents were 4-methylheptane, 2,4-dimethylheptane, p-xylene, and mesitylene. Catalytic pyrolysis of PP using CO2 over a Pt/C composite led to an increased formation of syngas, particularly CO, which is ascribed to the gas-phase interaction between CO2 and volatile matters (VMs) originating from PP. This study demonstrates that the use of a Pt/C composite as a catalyst in the pyrolysis of PP holds promise for the enhanced syngas generation, presenting a prospective avenue for more sustainable and efficient processes.
