You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of rice husk continuous torrefaction as a pretreatment for fast pyrolysis Rice husk (RH) is one of the most available biomasses in southern Brazil. One possible solution is to carry out the fast pyrolysis of RH. To improve the quality of liquid products biomass can be torrefied before being pyrolyzed. The influence of torrefaction on the physical and chemical properties of pyrolysis products was explored. Both torrefaction and pyrolysis reactions were performed in a fluidized bed reactor in a continuous mode. Sample with torrefaction and pyrolysis at 500 °C presented the highest biochar yield (44.2 wt.%). The torrefaction step produced a lower yield of bio-oil. In contrast, the highest bio-oil yield (43.6 wt.%) was achieved in the sample without torrefaction at 500 °C. The increase in temperature to 750 °C provided a specific area of 16.7 m²/kg for biochar. The highest value of HHV for bio-oil, 28 MJ/kg, was obtained via direct pyrolysis at 750 °C, which also led to the lowest water content of 5.9 wt%. According to the NMR analysis, the torrefaction liquid (TL) presented a high quantity of water and alcohols in its composition (92.5 %).
