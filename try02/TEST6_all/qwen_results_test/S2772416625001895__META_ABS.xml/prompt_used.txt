You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Northern white-cedar biochar as an effective adsorbent for lead (II) ion removal from groundwater: a promising environmental strategy In recent times, the issue of groundwater contamination by metals has become a cause for concern due to their harmful properties and ability to build up in the environment. A study was conducted to evaluate the quality of groundwater in Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), India, using standard methods. The results showed that lead (II), was the most prevalent metal found, with around 33.3 % of groundwater samples exceeding the recommended limit of 10 ppb for Pb levels as prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). This highlights the extensive Pb contamination in the groundwater of Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India. The toxicity of the water was determined through germination tests on Phaseolus mungo, which confirmed a decrease in germination and amylase activity. This study suggested the potential use of biochar made from Thuja occidentalis as a cost-effective material to remove Pb from water. The Thuja occidentalis biochar was characterized using SEM-EDS and FTIR techniques. A series of batch adsorption experiments using the Box-Behnken design (BBD) revealed that the biochar was effective in removing the metal at different concentration levels (10 ppb to 50 ppb for lower levels and 100 ppb to 500 ppb for higher levels) in both spiked and real samples. By employing a quadratic model, it was found that a contact time of 80 min, a pH of 6.0, and a stirring speed of 200 RPM were the optimal conditions for Pb removal, achieving a removal rate of 98.7 %. Thuja occidentalis biochar displayed capabilities as a natural material for the efficient removal of Pb through adsorption.
