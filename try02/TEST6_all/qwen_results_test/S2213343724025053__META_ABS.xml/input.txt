Carbons prepared by microwave co-pyrolysis of waste scrap tyres and corn cob: Effect of cation size and charge on xylene adsorption Carbons prepared by pyrolysis of waste corn cobs or scrap tyres using different microwave power (200, 400, 600 W) are compared with carbons prepared by co-pyrolysis of corn:tyre mixtures in various mass ratios without/with activator (KOH, ZnCl2, K2CO3, NaOH in solid or liquid phase). Activation and co-pyrolysis of corn:tyre mixture was proved to be advantageous, prepared activated carbons showed enhanced xylene adsorption compared to non-activated. Activated carbons prepared from corn:tyre mixture at mass ratio of 4:1 and using ZnCl2 in liquid and ZnCl2 and K2CO3 in solid phase showed the highest adsorption capacities (∼171, 139 and 104 mgxylene·g−1, respectively) despite the opposite trend in their microporosity. Molecular modeling proved a preferential interaction of xylene with activated carbons porous structure through Zn2+, K+ and Na+ ions. The smallest cation with the highest positive charge, Zn2+, interacts the most strongly with xylene. The strength of cation-xylene interaction decreases as follows: Zn2+ > Na+ > K+. As the strongest were proved xylene interactions with Pore (5.2 Å)_Zn2+ > Pore (8.5 Å)_Zn2+ > Surface_Zn2+ > Pore (5.2 Å)_Na+ ∼ Pore (5.2 Å)_K+, which explains the highest adsorption capacities of ZnCl2-activated carbons despite of their lower microporosity compared to carbon activated by using K2CO3(s).
