You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbons prepared by microwave co-pyrolysis of waste scrap tyres and corn cob: Effect of cation size and charge on xylene adsorption Carbons prepared by pyrolysis of waste corn cobs or scrap tyres using different microwave power (200, 400, 600 W) are compared with carbons prepared by co-pyrolysis of corn:tyre mixtures in various mass ratios without/with activator (KOH, ZnCl2, K2CO3, NaOH in solid or liquid phase). Activation and co-pyrolysis of corn:tyre mixture was proved to be advantageous, prepared activated carbons showed enhanced xylene adsorption compared to non-activated. Activated carbons prepared from corn:tyre mixture at mass ratio of 4:1 and using ZnCl2 in liquid and ZnCl2 and K2CO3 in solid phase showed the highest adsorption capacities (∼171, 139 and 104 mgxylene·g−1, respectively) despite the opposite trend in their microporosity. Molecular modeling proved a preferential interaction of xylene with activated carbons porous structure through Zn2+, K+ and Na+ ions. The smallest cation with the highest positive charge, Zn2+, interacts the most strongly with xylene. The strength of cation-xylene interaction decreases as follows: Zn2+ > Na+ > K+. As the strongest were proved xylene interactions with Pore (5.2 Å)_Zn2+ > Pore (8.5 Å)_Zn2+ > Surface_Zn2+ > Pore (5.2 Å)_Na+ ∼ Pore (5.2 Å)_K+, which explains the highest adsorption capacities of ZnCl2-activated carbons despite of their lower microporosity compared to carbon activated by using K2CO3(s).
