A detailed review on unlocking the potential of porous biocarbon in composite phase change materials for transformative thermal energy storage As energy demand increases, effective energy management and storage solutions become essential. Phase change materials (PCMs) are effective for thermal energy storage due to their high energy density and stable temperature performance. However, challenges like leakage and low thermal conductivity limit their use. Biocarbon composite PCMs, produced by encapsulating PCMs in biomass-derived carbon such as biochar and activated biochar, address these issues. These composites are suitable for thermal energy storage in solar energy utilization, energy conservation in buildings and greenhouses, and cold chain temperature control. Biocarbon offers excellent structural characteristics, including larger specific surface area, greater pore volume, better pore distribution, and strong chemical compatibility, enhancing PCM encapsulation. This review details the synthesis, characterization, and application of biocarbon-based composite PCMs, including biocarbon production and vacuum and melt blending techniques for PCM impregnation. It also addresses developmental constraints and identifies opportunities for further research to promote biomass recycling and carbon sequestration.
