Carbon biogenic with iron nanoparticles for removal of As(V) from water This manuscript presents evaluation of arsenic adsorption by carbon (Cb) and a carbonaceous material with iron nanoparticles (CbFe), coming from the pineapple peel (Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.) crown. Scanning electron microscopy results showed formation of three structures types in CbFe: spheres, filaments and spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 38 nm. CbFe material has a 167 m2/g specific area, 7±1 sites/nm2 site density and pH i = 11 isoelectric point, while Cb material presents values of 98.80 m2/g, 5 ± 1 sites/nm2 and pH i = 10 ± 0.6, respectively. Arsenic adsorption was evaluated for both materials; the kinetic equilibrium was obtained at 8 h, removing 138.5 mg As/kg by CbFe and 96.95 mg As/kg by Cb. Experimental data were best adjusted to a pseudo-second order model, indicating that removal of As(V) due to a chemisorption process. The sorption isotherms were adjusted to model Freundlich with R 2 = 0.8797 and R 2 = 0.9671, respectively. Results showed that both materials are a viable option for arsenic (V) adsorption in aqueous phase.
