Wind turbine blade recycling: A review of the recovery and high-value utilization of decommissioned wind turbine blades With the rapid growth of the wind energy industry, wind turbine blades installed in the early stages are reaching their retirement service life one after another. Efficient and proper recycling and utilization of discarded blades are crucial for the sustainable development of the industry. This paper analyzes and compares existing recycling technologies, including heat recovery, chemical recovery, and mechanical recovery. The primary component of wind turbine blades is GFRP, an inexpensive material ideally recycled through mechanical means. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative hierarchical mechanical recycling method. By considering the structural characteristics and residual value of the blades, the scheme simplifies the processing process, reduces costs, maximizes material value, and promotes comprehensive recycling of wind turbine blades. Additionally, exploring the feasibility of using thermoplastic composites to manufacture wind turbine blades aims to address challenges in the recycling process and support the green development, transformation, and upgrade of the wind power industry. We aim to contribute to the sustainable development of the wind power industry and collectively welcome a bright future of clean energy.
