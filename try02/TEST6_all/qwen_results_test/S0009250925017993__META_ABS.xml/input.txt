Elucidating jamming behaviors induced by polydispersity in biomass pyrolysis fluidized beds via coarse-grained CFD-DEM coupling model Particle polydispersity alters flow behavior, thereby strongly affecting heat transfer and biomass pyrolysis performance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. To gain deeper insight into the role of polydispersity, this study analyzed the effect of particle size distribution (PSD) width on biomass pyrolysis processes in fluidized beds. Firstly, a coarse-grained CFD-DEM coupling model for biomass pyrolysis was established. On this basis, particle velocity and bed voidage were analyzed. Under wide PSD conditions, particle velocity near the bed bottom approached 0 m/s. Meanwhile, the analyses of collision and drag force distributions showed that small particles disrupted the arching structures of a monodisperse system by altering the force balance. As the voids between large particles became progressively filled, the average collision force under a wide PSD increased by 57.8 %, promoting the development of localized jamming. The evolution of bed structures from arching to jamming consequently caused a transition in biomass particle trajectories. Furthermore, the effects of PSD width on particle temperature, heat transfer rate, reaction rate, and product yields were systematically investigated. The narrow PSD (σ/μ = 10–20 %) increased the interparticle heat transfer area, raising the fraction of biomass in the highest-temperature regions by 59.8 %, which consequently enhanced the reaction rates and tar yields. Based on the above results, a mechanism through bed structure evolution was finally proposed to elucidate the role of particle polydispersity on biomass pyrolysis. This work provides a theoretical foundation for regulating biomass pyrolysis characteristics and guiding the optimization of industrial fluidized bed reactors.
