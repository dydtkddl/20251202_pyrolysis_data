Eulerian – Eulerian CFD model on fluidized bed gasifier using coffee husks as fuel A two-dimensional CFD computational model has been developed to describe the gasification process of coffee husks within a fluidized bed reactor. The Eulerian - Eulerian method is used for both gas and solid phases to provide an explanation for mass exchange, energy, and momentum. The results were obtained after comparing both the numerical model and the experimental data for validation. The current model also predicts the effects of equivalence ratio and moisture content on gasification temperature, and provides sensitive analysis of the model of the produced syngas composition in addition to the higher heating value and cold gas efficiency. The simulated syngas composition was found to be in good agreement with the experiment. The high moisture content of coffee husk has negative effects on cold gas efficiency and HHV, an effect that decreases as the equivalence ratio increases.
