Electricity-driven reactors that promote thermochemical catalytic reactions via joule and induction heating Renewable electricity has become a more accessible, flexible, and widespread form of energy that is expected to help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The electrification of thermochemical catalytic processes using electricity-driven reactors is a promising transitional pathway to the eco-friendly low-carbon-footprint manufacturing of industrial chemicals. Among the various electrical heating methods, Joule heating and induction heating are particularly employed in electricity-driven thermochemical catalytic reactions, such as steam methane reforming, CO2 reduction, methane pyrolysis, ammonia synthesis/decomposition, and biomass conversion. This review introduces and summarizes recent achievements (mostly over the past three years) in thermochemical catalytic reactions that occur in electricity-driven reactors. Differences in the catalytic performance of electrical and conventional heating methods are highlighted. Issues associated with electricity-driven thermochemical catalytic reactions that require further research are also discussed.
