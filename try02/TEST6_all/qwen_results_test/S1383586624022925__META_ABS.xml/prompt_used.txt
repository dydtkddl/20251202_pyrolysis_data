You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-removal of mercury and organic dye via the rectangle-shaped nanosheets loaded hydrochar: Surface interactions and DFT calculations Inorganic and organic pollutants usually co-exist in practical wastewater, leading to difficult co-removal processes due to their different physiochemical properties. In this study, the palygorskite nanosheets loaded hydrochar (PNLH) was synthesized for the mercury (Hg) and methylene blue (MB) co-contaminated wastewater. The physicochemical characteristics of PNLH were investigated comprehensively, and the maximum capacity of Hg(II) and MB reached 149 and 153 mg/g, respectively. Based on analysis, the surface interactions between PNLH with Hg(II) and MB included complexation, hydrogen bonding, pore filling, etc. More importantly, the performance of PNLH was improved in the Hg(II)-MB binary system, while the synergistic effects were attributed to the bridging interactions and formation of complexations between Hg(II) and MB. The density functional theory (DFT) method was applied to demonstrate that the oxygen-containing functional groups such as O–Mg, O–Al, and –OH introduced by the clay greatly enhanced the interactions, and the synergistic adsorption mechanism was also elucidated. The regeneration experiments, column studies, and economic feasibility analysis further demonstrated the practicality of PNLH for effluent purification. This study provides a solution for environmental remediation materials dealing with inorganic–organic co-polluted wastewater.
