Co-removal of mercury and organic dye via the rectangle-shaped nanosheets loaded hydrochar: Surface interactions and DFT calculations Inorganic and organic pollutants usually co-exist in practical wastewater, leading to difficult co-removal processes due to their different physiochemical properties. In this study, the palygorskite nanosheets loaded hydrochar (PNLH) was synthesized for the mercury (Hg) and methylene blue (MB) co-contaminated wastewater. The physicochemical characteristics of PNLH were investigated comprehensively, and the maximum capacity of Hg(II) and MB reached 149 and 153 mg/g, respectively. Based on analysis, the surface interactions between PNLH with Hg(II) and MB included complexation, hydrogen bonding, pore filling, etc. More importantly, the performance of PNLH was improved in the Hg(II)-MB binary system, while the synergistic effects were attributed to the bridging interactions and formation of complexations between Hg(II) and MB. The density functional theory (DFT) method was applied to demonstrate that the oxygen-containing functional groups such as O–Mg, O–Al, and –OH introduced by the clay greatly enhanced the interactions, and the synergistic adsorption mechanism was also elucidated. The regeneration experiments, column studies, and economic feasibility analysis further demonstrated the practicality of PNLH for effluent purification. This study provides a solution for environmental remediation materials dealing with inorganic–organic co-polluted wastewater.
