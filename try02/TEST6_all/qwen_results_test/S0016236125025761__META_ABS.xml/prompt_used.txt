You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic influence of calcium-rich inorganics in pulp and paper mill sludge on the organics pyrolysis The mechanisms by which calcium-rich inorganics within pulp and paper mill sludge (PPMS) influence the pyrolysis of its organic components remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the effects of inorganic constituents on the evolution of pyrolysis products from major organic components (cellulose, plastics, lipids, proteins, and ink) in PPMS through fixed-bed pyrolysis experiments. The results demonstrated that inorganics significantly promoted secondary tar reactions by improving heat transfer, providing catalytic sites, and prolonging the residence time of pyrolysis vapors. These effects markedly increased gas yields, particularly CO2 (e.g., by 29.27–35.41 mL/g for cellulose), and decreased tar yields (e.g., by 10.27–11.38 wt% for cellulose), while also altering tar composition. Specifically, calcium-rich inorganics catalyzed the conversion of cellulose into small ketone molecules such as hydroxyacetone, reducing the proportions of anhydrosugars and furans. For plastics, PPMS ash promoted the β-scission of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and the transformation of monocyclic hydrocarbons into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons while also increasing char formation. For lipids, calcium-rich inorganics effectively catalyzed the decarboxylative ketonization of palmitic acid to produce 2-heptadecanone. For proteins, PPMS ash suppressed NH3 release and promoted nitrogen migration into nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds. For ink, the inherently high ash content limited the regulatory effect of additional ash. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insights into PPMS pyrolysis and supports its sustainable conversion.
