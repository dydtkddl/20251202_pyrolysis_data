You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

S/G ratio and lignin structure among Eucalyptus hybrids determined by Py-GC/MS and nitrobenzene oxidation The ratio among syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) lignin substructures is increasingly used as criteria in the selection of Eucalyptus species to pulping processes. The S/G distribution of several Brazilian Eucalyptus species and their crossings was determined by analytical pyrolysis-GC/MS (Py-GC/MS) and alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation directly from wood fibers. The ratio varied among the Eucalyptus hybrids. In Py-GC/MS, the S/G ratio is calculated by summing up the proportions of S and G type lignin pyrolysis products with various 1–3 carbon containing side chain structures. Py-GC/MS revealed that the distribution of the lignin side chain structures varied among the species. Similar trends were seen both in the G and in the S series. The result was verified with principal component analysis (PCA), which also revealed that similar side chains structures in the G and S units are correlated with each other. That PCA result confirmed that all G and S type degradation products should be included in the calculation of S/G ratios instead of selected products. S/G ratios determined by Py-GC/MS and alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation were close to each other, but not equal. Lower values were obtained by Py-GC/MS. The differences between the two methods are probably related the degradation mechanism of lignin with Py-GC/MS and nitrobenzene oxidation methods. Based on these results, it is not possible to say which of the methods is more reliable. However, both methods can well be used to compare the S/G ratios of lignin among samples.
