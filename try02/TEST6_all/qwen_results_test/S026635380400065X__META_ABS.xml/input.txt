Polymer-layered silicate–carbon nanotube nanocomposites: unique nanofiller synergistic effect In this study, a new type of materials, based on ethylene–vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, commercial organo-modified clays (organoclays) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) has been prepared via direct melt blending. Both crude and purified MWNTs have been investigated. Thermal, flame retardant and tensile properties of the resulting new ternary nanocomposites have been measured and compared to the corresponding binary systems, i.e., EVA filled with either clays or carbon nanotubes. This new family of composites exhibits enhanced properties even at very low filler level usually inferior to 5 wt%. Interestingly, a synergistic effect arising from the combination of MWNTs and organoclays has been evidenced in some cases.
