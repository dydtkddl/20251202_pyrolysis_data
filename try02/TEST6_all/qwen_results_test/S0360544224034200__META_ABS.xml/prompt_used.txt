You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into the char-production mechanism during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes Co-pyrolysis is a promising method for converting biomass/plastic wastes into high-value-added carbon materials. The mechanism involved in co-pyrolysis process for char production is complex and the relevant information is limited, making it essential to investigate the evolution mechanism. In response, different co-pyrolysis methods (blending with multiple interaction, volatile-volatile interaction, volatile-char interaction) were adopted for bamboo and polyethylene (PE). The char-production mechanism was investigated based on physicochemical properties and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis of char. The addition of PE significantly affected the char properties compared to bamboo pyrolysis. The yield of char increased from 24.80 % to 26.59 % and the specific surface area decreased from 103.64 m2 g−1 to 1.84 m2 g−1. The High H/C ratio, low O/C ratio, low porosity, and high oxidation reactivity of co-pyrolysis char is attribute to hydrodeoxygenation reactions on char surface and the deposition of amorphous carbon on the bamboo char. Experiments with different co-pyrolysis methods revealed a significant synergistic effect between bamboo char and volatiles from PE, with the latter depositing on the former's surface as amorphous carbon. The interaction between bamboo char and volatiles from PE during co-pyrolysis was revealed by in-situ DRIFT analysis, further elucidating the evolution mechanism. A series of hydrodeoxygenation reactions and radical transfer reactions were induced to occur. It is of great significance to further study the mechanism of co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic wastes.
