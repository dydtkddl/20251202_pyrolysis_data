Porous titanium foil by tape casting technique A novel method of manufacturing titanium porous sheets used as a support for photo- and electro-catalysts is presented. The titanium foils are shaped by the tape casting technique from titanium powder and organic binder and then sintered in vacuum. The unique combination of a reducing chemical agent and vacuum in one processing step was applied to improve sinterability of titanium powder that results in decreasing of the temperature of the process to even 1000°C. The manufacturing technique allows manufacturing of strong titanium products, porous or fully dense.
