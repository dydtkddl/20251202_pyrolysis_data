You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification of sanitary napkin with sawdust biomass in downdraft gasifier for thermal applications: An experimental approach Co-gasification is considered an effective treatment method for waste containing plastics and biomass for conversion into producer gas. This paper investigates treating personal hygiene care products like sanitary napkin waste by co-gasification with sawdust biomass pellets in a 50 KWh capacity downdraft gasifier to generate producer gas for thermal applications. The present experimental study is one of its kind for treating sanitary napkins waste via co-gasification technology that focuses on energy generation. Water loaded sanitary napkin content was increased from 0 wt% to 3.8 wt% in the total feedstock to evaluate the producer gas quality. Moisture plays dominant role compared to presence of plastic in a napkin with increasing napkin content. Increasing the napkin content in total feedstock from 0 wt% to 3.8 wt% leads to temperature decrease of all reaction zones in the gasifier. In contrast, LHV and clinker formation was reduced from 4.03 MJ/Nm3 to 3.3 MJ/Nm3 and 1 wt% to 0.76 wt%, respectively. Napkin loading of 1.4 wt% gives the best LHV and CGE of 4.05 MJ/Nm3 and 61.7%. Results reveal that the reactor can smoothly operate up to 3.8 wt% loading, generating producer gas flame temperature above 950 °C suitable for a wide range of thermal applications.
