You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pollutant emissions during the pyrolysis and combustion of starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) biodegradable films The massive use of petroleum-based polymers and their improper waste treatment has brought on significant global environmental problems due to their non-biodegradable nature. Starch/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) bioplastics are suitable substitutes for conventional polymers, such as polyethylene, due to their full biodegradability and excellent mechanical properties. Knowledge of the pollutant emissions during pyrolysis and combustion of starch/PVA films is important because they can arrive at landfills mixed with conventional polymers and be thermally degraded in uncontrolled fires. On the other hand, controlled thermal treatments could result in thermal valorization of the waste. Pyrolysis and combustion experiments were carried out at 650, 750, 850 and 950 °C in a laboratory furnace. The analysis of carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, and semivolatile compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is shown. Experiments showed lower pollutant emissions than those found with conventional polymers, such as polyethylene and polyester, in the same equipment. Nevertheless, the pyrolysis run at 950 °C showed the highest light hydrocarbon yield (123013 mg kg−1), but this is considerably lower than the values found for polyethylene. The main semivolatile compounds (not PAHs) emitted, with maximum yields ranging from 1351 to 4694 mg kg−1, were benzaldehyde, phenol, indene, and acetophenone. Specifically, the total semivolatile compounds emitted after pyrolysis and combustion of starch/PVA samples represent only 38 and 50%, respectively, of those emitted with polyethylene. Further, the main PAHs were naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and phenanthrene with maximum values of 4694, 2704 and 1496 mg kg−1, respectively. The PAH yield was considerably higher in experiments with low oxygen content.
