You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignin over biochar and activated carbon derived from the identical process In this study, a sustainable in situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of lignin was developed by using biochar and activated carbon (AC) as catalysts, which is derived from the same CFP of lignin process. The results showed that using biochar as the catalyst mainly promoted the production of non-condensable gas, water, and guaiacol-rich oil regardless of the biochar-to-lignin ratio. The catalytic effect of the biochar was mainly attributed to the surface sodium and alkali metals. Using AC44.7% and AC48.6% as the catalyst resulted in a high yield of guaiacol-rich oil, whereas using AC64.3% induced a great decrease of the tarry oil yield and a significant increase of the phenol concentration in bio-oil. The diffusion efficiency of the reactive intermediates inside the catalysts determined by the pore size was believed to be the greatest determinant of the catalytic performance of the ACs. The mesopores were large enough to allow most of the reactive intermediates to diffuse quickly and react. Moreover, by using the same catalyst, char agglomeration was almost completely suppressed after in situ CFP. Two major problems, tar production and char agglomeration, which limit the large-scale application of fast lignin pyrolysis are believed to be solved.
