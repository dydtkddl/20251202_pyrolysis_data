You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of NiMoO4 ceramics by proteic sol-gel method and investigation of their catalytic properties in hydrogen production A proteic sol-gel route was used in the production of NiMoO4 catalysts, which used edible gelatin as a precursor. The triple helix structure of a protein in contact with identical structures acquires an unfolded form, which favors the interaction of the reactive groups of the gelatin (NH3 + and COO−) with the metallic ions (MoO4 2− and Ni2+). The synthesized catalysts were thoroughly characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis, Raman scattering, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, UV–Vis spectroscopy, and colorimetry. The results showed that it is possible to prepare the phase-pure α-NiMoO4 polymorph only at temperatures above 700 °C, while a mixture of the polymorphs α and β were obtained at lower temperatures. The synthesized materials calcined at 300, 500, and 700 °C have their catalytic potentials tested in the ethanol steam reforming reaction aiming the production of hydrogen and presented a good performance. The results indicated that among tested materials, the sample calcined at 700 °C exhibited the highest stability, activity, and best selectivity relative to the product of interest.
