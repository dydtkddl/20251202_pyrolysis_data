Catalytic ammonia cracking: Future of material chemistry research for sustainable hydrogen energy economy To date, no one can imagine our sustainable growth without developing efficient energy storage, utilization of renewable energies sources, transportation, energy saving. In order to look into the alternatives of traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, in recent times, significant development carried out towards sustainable hydrogen production. Moreover, its physio-chemical characteristics create its transport and storage one of the major obstacles for its commercial-scale applications. To resolve this issue, ammonia, a gas of having large hydrogen quantity and energy density, has proved itself as a promising zero-carbon energy transporter for mass energy storage. Catalytic ammonia cracking has been used for hydrogen regeneration due to non-production of NOx. Herein, we have discussed about its various protocols to conceptuealize “hydrogen-energy economy” which is an integrated development of hydrogen production protocols, storage methods, and followed by utilization as energy through fuel cells.
