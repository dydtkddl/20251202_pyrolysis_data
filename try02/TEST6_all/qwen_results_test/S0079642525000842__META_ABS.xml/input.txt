The wide range of battery systems: From micro- to structural batteries, from biodegradable to high performance batteries Battery systems are essential components of the on-going energy transition and digitalization of society. With the need to power an increasing variety of portable and stationary systems, ranging from disposable point-of-care devices or smart packaging systems to applications in portable computers and electric cars, an increasing variety of batteries and battery systems are being developed, each aiming to specific sets of required performance parameters, including energy and power density, cycling stability, flexibility, degradability, environmental impact or improved integration into the specific application context. This work analyzed the state of the art of the different materials and geometries, performance parameters and applications of the different battery systems. We discuss the rationale behind each material selection, the processing technologies and the integration into the specific application, taking into account the whole life-cycle of the battery. Further, the main challenges posed for each battery type will provide a roadmap for their successful development and application.
