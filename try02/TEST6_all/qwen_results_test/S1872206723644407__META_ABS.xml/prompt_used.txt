You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-oxidative coupling of methane over Mo-doped CeO2 catalysts: Understanding surface and gas-phase processes Direct catalytic non-oxidative coupling is a promising route for the valorization of abundant methane. Understanding the mechanism is difficult because reactions at the surface of the catalyst and in the gas phase via radicals are important at the high temperatures employed. Herein, a series of Mo-doped CeO2 samples with isolated Mo sites were prepared by flame spray pyrolysis method and screened for their performance in non-oxidative coupling of methane. The selectivity to value-added C2 hydrocarbons (ethane and ethylene) among gas-phase products could reach 98%. During the reaction, the isolated Mo-oxo species in the as-prepared catalyst are reduced and convert into Mo (oxy-)carbide species, which act as the active sites for methane activation. By varying the available catalyst-free gas volume along the length of the reactor, we studied the contribution of gas-phase reactions in the formation of different products. Ethane is the primary product of non-oxidative methane coupling and, at least, a part of ethylene and most of benzene is formed through gas-phase chemistry. This work provides insights into the design of efficient catalysts for non-oxidative coupling of methane and highlights the importance of reducing the free volume in the reactor to limit secondary gas-phase reactions.
