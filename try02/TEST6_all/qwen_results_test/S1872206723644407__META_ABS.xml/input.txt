Non-oxidative coupling of methane over Mo-doped CeO2 catalysts: Understanding surface and gas-phase processes Direct catalytic non-oxidative coupling is a promising route for the valorization of abundant methane. Understanding the mechanism is difficult because reactions at the surface of the catalyst and in the gas phase via radicals are important at the high temperatures employed. Herein, a series of Mo-doped CeO2 samples with isolated Mo sites were prepared by flame spray pyrolysis method and screened for their performance in non-oxidative coupling of methane. The selectivity to value-added C2 hydrocarbons (ethane and ethylene) among gas-phase products could reach 98%. During the reaction, the isolated Mo-oxo species in the as-prepared catalyst are reduced and convert into Mo (oxy-)carbide species, which act as the active sites for methane activation. By varying the available catalyst-free gas volume along the length of the reactor, we studied the contribution of gas-phase reactions in the formation of different products. Ethane is the primary product of non-oxidative methane coupling and, at least, a part of ethylene and most of benzene is formed through gas-phase chemistry. This work provides insights into the design of efficient catalysts for non-oxidative coupling of methane and highlights the importance of reducing the free volume in the reactor to limit secondary gas-phase reactions.
