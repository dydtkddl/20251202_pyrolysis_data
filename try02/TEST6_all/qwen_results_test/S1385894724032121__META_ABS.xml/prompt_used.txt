You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Magnetic Harvesting and Degradation of Microplastics using Iron Oxide Nanoflowers prepared by a Scaled-up Procedure Addressing the ecological risks and human health threats posed by emerging contaminants requires the development of reproducible and scalable materials and technologies. In this context, the performance of multicore flower-shaped nanoparticles (NFs) with approximately 40 nm diameters was assessed for extracting and degrading polyethylene microplastics from cosmetics in water samples. These NFs, exhibiting cooperative magnetic behavior and high magnetic moment per particle, were scaled to grams of product in a larger reactor (1 L), yielding a 91 % mean reproducibility for structural, colloidal and magnetic properties. The NFs were directly attached to microplastic surfaces via ultrasonic treatment and separated using a permanent magnet, demonstrating removal capacities of up to 1000 mgMP/gNF under optimal conditions (pH 7, 10 mg NFs, 30 min, field strength 320 kA/m). Subsequently, microplastics in aqueous suspensions were hydrolyzed at 150 °C followed by mineralization through a Fenton-like reaction catalyzed by the NFs where reactive oxygen species produced, in the presence of H2O2, break the organic molecules. Mineralization yields ranged from 20 % to 75 % at 25 and 90 °C, respectively, with a further increase to 78 % achieved under an alternating magnetic field (60 mT, 100 kHz), obviating the need for high temperatures. These results highlight the potential of NFs and associated technologies in effectively addressing the challenges associated with emerging contaminants, offering promising avenues for environmental remediation and human health protection.
