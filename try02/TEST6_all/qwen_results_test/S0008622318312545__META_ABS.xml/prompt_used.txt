You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structural and electrochemical properties of babassu coconut mesocarp-generated activated carbon and few-layer graphene Activated Carbon (AC) with high specific surface area and elevated porosity was synthesized from babassu mesocarp by hydrothermal carbonization, followed by KOH activation-coupled pyrolysis and subjected to heat-treatment at three different temperatures to generate AC-1100, AC-1400 and AC-2200. Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N2 adsorption-desorption were used to characterize structurally the synthesized materials and electrochemical studies to evaluate the capacitance properties. The Raman spectra showed sharpening of graphitic bands and decrease in intensities of amorphous bands with the increase of treatment temperature. AC-2200 showed a significant decrease of ID/IG due to the crystal growth in ab plane and drastic increase of I2D/IG due to graphitic ordering in c direction, further proven by sharpening of characteristic XRD peaks and visualization of few-layer well-formed graphite micro-crystals by TEM. Although gradual heat treatment resulted in an increase in sample crystallinity, the surface area and porosity decreased, leaving AC-2200 practically non-porous. These changes were reflected in their electrochemical properties as AC-1400 showed highest double layer capacitance owing to an optimization between structural ordering and retention of porosity, while the capacitance, as well as the resistance, of AC-2200, decreases dramatically due to loss of pores and increased crystallinity brought in by graphitization.
