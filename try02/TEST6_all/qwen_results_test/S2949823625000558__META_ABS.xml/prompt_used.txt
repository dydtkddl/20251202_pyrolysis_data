You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrated study of catalytic pyrolysis of bakelite waste: Catalyst variations, kinetic analysis, and batch pyrolysis Bakelite poses environmental and health hazards upon disposal, necessitating effective recycling strategies. This study explores catalytic pyrolysis of Bakelite using La₂O₃, CeO₂, and ZrO₂ (2.5, 5, 10 wt%) to assess kinetic, thermodynamic parameters and screen suitable catalysts. The maximum weight loss of Bakelite (62.91 wt%) was observed with 5 wt% La₂O₃. Kinetic analysis shows that Bakelite, with and without La₂O₃ (2.5, 5, and 10 wt%) follows a 1.5th-order mechanism, with activation energies of 83.09, 82.83, 75.43, and 83.41 kJ/mol, and Arrhenius factors of 4.39 × 10 ¹ ², 5.50 × 10 ¹ ², 1.88 × 10 ¹ ², and 4.05 × 10 ¹ ² min⁻¹ , respectively. For a 1.5th-order degradation, pure Bakelite showed ΔS = –0.05 kJ·K⁻¹ ·mol⁻¹ , ΔH = 76.42 kJ/mol, and ΔG = 104.80 kJ/mol; with 5 wt% La₂O₃, these shifted to –0.06 kJ·K⁻¹ ·mol⁻¹ , 72.75 kJ/mol, and 105.16 kJ/mol, respectively. Batch pyrolysis of Bakelite yielded 39.12 wt% condensable, 30.36 wt% gas, and 30.52 wt% residue, which shifted to 45.15, 31.56, and 23.29 wt% with 5 wt% La₂O₃, respectively. GC-MS of pyrolytic oil from bakelite without 5 wt% La₂O₃ showed alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and oxygenates, including alcohols, ketones, ethers, and esters, while with 5 wt% La₂O₃, alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and oxygenates like alcohols and esters were detected, confirmed by FTIR. This study proposes a novel catalytic pyrolysis of Bakelite using La₂O₃, CeO₂, and ZrO₂, integrating kinetic and thermodynamic analysis to enhance oil yield, selectivity, and resource recovery from a rarely explored bakelite.
