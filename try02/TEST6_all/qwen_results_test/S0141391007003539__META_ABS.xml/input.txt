Mechanistic implications of plastic degradation Plastics have become an indispensable ingredient of human life. Their enormous use is a matter of great environmental and economic concern, which has motivated the researchers and the technologists to induce different degrees of degradations in the plastic. These degradations can be induced in a better way if their mechanistic implications are properly understood. A better understanding of the mechanism for these degradations is also advocated in order to facilitate the proper use of the alternative waste disposal strategies. In view of the facts concerning the plastic degradation, in this review article, we have discussed various types of polymeric degradations along with their mechanisms, which include photo-oxidative degradation, thermal degradation, ozone-induced degradation, mechanochemical degradation, catalytic degradation and biodegradation. This article also discusses the different methods used to study these degradations and the factors that affect these degradations.
