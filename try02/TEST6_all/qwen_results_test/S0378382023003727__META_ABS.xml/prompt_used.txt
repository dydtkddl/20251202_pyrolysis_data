You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the joint valorization of CO2 and waste plastics by pyrolysis and in line dry reforming for syngas production This paper assesses the potential of plastics valorization by pyrolysis and in line catalytic dry reforming for syngas production. Previous studies showed the suitability of a continuous process made up of a conical spouted bed reactor for fast pyrolysis and a fluidized bed reactor for catalytic steam reforming. In order to step further in the application of this technology under dry reforming conditions, equilibrium simulation was approached to analyze process performance, as the development and optimization of this technology for the production of high-quality syngas requires understanding in detail the complex influence of process parameters. Thus, this study deals with the influence of main process parameters, namely, temperature, CO2/C ratio and the type of plastic, on the process performance. Furthermore, the role played by steam co-feeding in the dry reforming in order to adjust syngas H2/CO ratio was evaluated by varying the steam/carbon ratio. The obtained results clearly show that a strict control of process conditions is required to ensure high conversion to syngas and avoid undesired reactions, such as reverse WGS. Among the plastics studied, polyolefins are those of highest potential for syngas production, but polystyrene allows producing a high quality syngas through a combined reforming strategy.
