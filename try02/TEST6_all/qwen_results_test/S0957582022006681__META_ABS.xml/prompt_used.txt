You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil obtained from microwave co-pyrolysis of food waste and low-density polyethylene Food waste can be a useful carbon resource when chemically recycled. While co-pyrolysis of realistic food waste (FW) has been studied, its complex upgrading is yet to be investigated. The catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) was employed for studying the pyrolysis oil generated from microwave co-pyrolysis of FW and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). More particularly, the effects of reaction temperature and time on stream were assessed in a continuous flow reactor. The combination of 48 h on stream at 200 ⁰C exhibited optimal performance in terms of nitro-oxygenated compounds reduction (N1–2, O1N1, O1N2 and O2N1 classes) and large oxygenated compounds classes (O7-O9) conversion into smaller ones (O1-O4). Stability analysis of pyrolysis oil showed that HDO significantly improved the properties of HDO oil (density, pH, TAN and HHV) and stabilized its properties for longer storability (60 days), i.e., after HDO at 48 h/200 ⁰C the oil quality had improved in terms of lower density (18 %), moisture content (88 %) and TAN (74 %) along with a higher pH and HHV (28 % and 51 %, respectively). This brings the HDO oil quality close to generic bio-oil and bio-diesel standard requirements.
