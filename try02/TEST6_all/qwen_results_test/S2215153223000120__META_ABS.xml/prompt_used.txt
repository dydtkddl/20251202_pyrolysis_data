You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

U(VI) removal from water by novel P-modified activated carbon derived from polymeric microspheres Phosphorous-modified mesoporous carbon was obtained by thermochemical modification-carbonization of originally synthesized polymeric microspheres with orthophosphoric acid. The obtained material was characterized by physicochemical methods. The adsorption properties of the obtained carbon material towards U(VI) ions were studied and compared to the pristine polymeric microspheres. The highest static adsorption capacity of U(VI) onto studied carbonaceous material (150 mg ‧ g−1) was observed at pH = 1.8 after 2 min contact time. The pseudo-first-order and Langmuir theoretical models were best fitted to the experimental kinetics and equilibrium data. Studied ions present at concentration levels found in natural waters had a negligible effect on U(VI) adsorption onto synthesized carbonaceous material. The adsorption mechanism of U(VI) onto the studied carbon material consisted of surface complexation and interactions with π-π electrons and ion exchange. The synthesized material can be easily regenerated by 1 mol ‧ L-1 NaHCO3 (pH = 12.6). The phosphorous-modified carbon was successfully used both for efficient removal of U(VI) ions from model water samples and for the enrichment of trace levels of U from water samples prior to its determination by the TXRF technique. The LOD for the proposed procedure of U determination by TXRF technique after the enrichment step was 0.011 µg ‧ L-1.
