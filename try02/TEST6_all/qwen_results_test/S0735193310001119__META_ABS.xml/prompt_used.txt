You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling gas oil spray coalescence and vaporization in gas solid riser reactor The sprayed feed droplet behavior, including coalescence and vaporization into gas–solid flow, is complex especially near the atomizer region in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) riser reactor. A three dimensional CFD model of the riser reactor has been developed, which takes into the account three phase hydrodynamics, heat transfer and evaporation of the liquid droplets into a gas–solid flow as well as phase interactions. A hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian approach was applied to numerically simulate the collision and vaporization of gas oil droplets in the gas–solid fluidized bed. This numerical simulation accounts the possibility of coalescence of feed spray droplets in computing the trajectories and its impact on droplet penetration in the reactor. The modeling result shows that droplet coalescence mainly occurs at the initial part of the atomizing region and where three phase flow hits the reactor wall and bounces back. The model has the ability of inspecting the effects of feed injector geometry on the overall reactor hydrodynamic and heat transfer. The CFD simulation results showed that the evaporated droplet gas caused higher local velocities of the gas and solid particles and gas–solid flow temperature reduction.
