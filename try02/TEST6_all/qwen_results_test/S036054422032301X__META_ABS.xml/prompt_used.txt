You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multivariate optimisation study and life cycle assessment of microwave-induced pyrolysis of horse manure for waste valorisation and management The increasing amount of waste generated globally due to industrialisation and economic activities require a proper and efficient waste management route. Turning waste to energy via pyrolysis pathway is a promising solution to reduce the amount of waste while generating useful end products. In the present study, microwave pyrolysis of horse manure for the production of bio-fuels and bio-chemicals is conducted and optimised using a lab-scale reactor. Pyrolytic products derived from optimised parameters show that the energy density of bio-char increased by 38.7% with a surface area of 799.57 m2g-1. The bio-oil was found to be enriched with phenolic content while the gaseous product contained high syngas proportion (67.17 vol%). A life cycle assessment (LCA) on the microwave pyrolysis of horse manure for a modelled pyrolysis plant located in Peninsula Malaysia has been conducted to evaluate the energy consumption, operation cost and environmental impact of each unit processes involved. Processing of horse manure via microwave-induced pyrolysis is demonstrated to be more advantageous as compared to the conventional pyrolysis of swine manure from the aspects of higher conversion efficiency, lower energy consumption and reduced environmental risk. Overall, the LCA of horse manure on microwave pyrolysis shows positive environmental impact as compared to other biowaste treatment methods such as composting and incineration.
