Review on synthesis of lactic acid and lactates from biomass derived carbohydrates via chemocatalysis routes The utilization of renewable lignocellulosic biomass resources is a promising solution to deal with the deficit of fossil resources and the associated environmental concerns. Among diverse biomass-derived products, lactic acid (LA) stands out as one of the most successful commodities and also a platform to connect raw biomass feedstocks with value-added chemicals and degradable polymers. Herein, we critically review the recent advances in the design and development of base, acid, and multifunctional catalytic systems for the conversion of different carbohydrates to LA and alkyl lactates via chemical routes. In addition to critically evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of different catalytic systems, we provide deep insights into the reaction mechanisms, including the reaction pathways of different feedstocks, the catalytic roles of different kinds of active sites, and the structure–activity relationship. We conclude with our perspective on the key challenges and future opportunities.
