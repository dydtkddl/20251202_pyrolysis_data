You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastic waste as pyrolysis feedstock for plastic oil production: A review Turning plastic waste into plastic oil by pyrolysis is one of the promising techniques to eradicate plastic waste pollution and accelerate the circular economy of plastic materials. Plastic waste is an attractive pyrolysis feedstock for plastic oil production owing to its favorable chemical properties of proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, and heating value other than its abundant availability. Despite the exponential growth of scientific output from 2015 to 2022, a vast majority of the current review articles cover the pyrolysis of plastic waste into a series of fuels and value-added products, and up-to-date reviews exclusively on plastic oil production from pyrolysis are relatively scarce. In light of this void in the current review articles, this review attempts to provide an up-to-date overview of plastic waste as pyrolysis feedstock for plastic oil production. A particular emphasis is placed on the common types of plastic as primary sources of plastic pollution, the characteristics (proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, hydrogen/carbon ratio, heating value, and degradation temperature) of various plastic wastes and their potential as pyrolysis feedstock, and the pyrolysis systems (reactor type and heating method) and conditions (temperature, heating rate, residence time, pressure, particle size, reaction atmosphere, catalyst and its operation modes, and single and mixed plastic wastes) used in plastic waste pyrolysis for plastic oil production. The characteristics of plastic oil from pyrolysis in terms of physical properties and chemical composition are also outlined and discussed. The major challenges and future prospects for the large-scale production of plastic oil from pyrolysis are also addressed.
