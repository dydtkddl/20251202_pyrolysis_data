You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of the crystal structure effect and mechanism during chemical looping gasification of coal Chemical looping gasification (CLG) of coal, in which oxygen is provided to coal by oxygen carriers directly, is a clean and efficient way to generate syngas. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of lignite char with oxygen carriers was conducted in this work, and the experimental results indicated that the oxygen carriers, Ti0·5Mn0·5Fe2O4, MnFe2O4, FeTiO3 and Fe2TiO4, had a positive effect on CLG of lignite char. The effect of these oxygen carriers was discussed in the perspective of the crystal structure. XPS experiment was performed and the spectra of O 1s revealed the effect of different element on reactivity of spinel-based oxygen carriers. Five kinetic models, including Uniform Reaction (UR), Integrated Model (IM), Modified Random Pore Model (MRPM), Random Pore Model (RPM) and Modified Volumetric Model (MVM), were employed for revealing the reaction mechanism. MRPM had the highest correlation coefficient for each oxygen carrier, which means the introduction of the oxygen carriers effectively increases the active site of the reaction surface.
