Inorganic mesoporous oxides: From research to industrial applications Striving to achieve greater efficiency in technological processes is driven by the growing demand for chemicals, but also by increasing environmental regulations. Mesoporous materials have great potential to be used as catalysts, carriers, and sorbents to improve the effectiveness of miscellaneous processes in the chemical industry. These materials are usually synthesized in powder form and must be shaped prior to use in industrial systems. The challenges with scaling up production of solids and problems with transforming powdered materials into technical bodies are generally underrated in scientific literature. The present review aims to summarize the most common procedures for manufacturing shaped mesoporous materials (including 3D printing) customized to the prospective applications. The focus is on the most popular mesoporous oxides such as silica and alumina, although the presented shaping strategies can be adapted to other mesostructured materials. This review demonstrates the effect of the molding procedure, binder incorporation, and other components on the performance of shaped mesoporous materials.
