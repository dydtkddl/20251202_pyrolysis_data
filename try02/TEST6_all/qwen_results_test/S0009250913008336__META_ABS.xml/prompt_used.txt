You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquefaction of wood in hot compressed water Part 1 — Experimental results The dissolution of wood in subcritical water in the context of a hydrothermal biomass gasification process is studied in order to provide insight into the effects of the operating parameters during the liquefaction step on the product distribution. Batch experiments were conducted at temperatures of 250–350°C and pressures of 15–30MPa and at various holding times. The product yields showed that the early product-forming reactions are very fast, and to go to completion within the heating stage for the experimental setup used. A hydrolysis experiment using the water-soluble products as feedstock confirmed the obtained water-soluble products to be final, as they did not undergo further hydrolysis to other products. The conversion of wood to liquid and gaseous products as well as the carbon content of the solid residue increased with increasing temperature. At lower temperatures, the reaction products of hydrolysis were mostly water-soluble, while with increasing temperature the methanol-soluble products were most abundant. The hexane-soluble products were negligible in almost all cases, and the gas products were predominantly composed of CO2. The experiments provide information about the yields of different products at different temperatures, their composition, and the effect of the operating conditions on the formation of primary and secondary char and on the limitations imposed on the primary product formation.
