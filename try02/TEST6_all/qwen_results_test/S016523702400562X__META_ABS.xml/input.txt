Co-pyrolysis of lignin and polyethylene with reactive molecular dynamics: Understanding tar generation and char structure transformation Co-pyrolysis of oxygen-rich lignin and hydrogen-rich polyethylene (PE) is a promising strategy to achieve waste valorization. Although the synergistic effects between lignin and PE can improve the quality of biochar and bio-oil, the underlying cross-reaction pathways remain unclear due to the complexity associated with lignin and PE pyrolysis. To address the problem, the current work investigated the co-pyrolysis of lignin and PE by combining ReaxFF MD simulation with very large-scale models containing 80,000 + atoms and experiments of thermogravimetric analysis and micro-reactor pyrolysis. A unique ReaxFF MD simulation strategy for decoupling pyrolysis stage and char formation stage was carried out to obtain char-like structures with acceptable computational cost. The effectiveness of the method was proved through matching weight loss profiles and phenol distribution in the simulation with experiment results from pyrolysis of enzymatic lignin. By simulating the pyrolysis of lignin, PE and lignin-PE blend, it was found that the formation of hydrocarbon tars was inhibited while that of oxygenated tar promoted. Hydrogen abstraction/transfer from PE to lignin enhanced the yields of phenolic monomers and aromatic hydrocarbons and inhibited those of larger phenolic compounds, which can be attributed to reinforced cleavage of C-O, C-H and C-C bonds in the late period of co-pyrolysis that were hardly accessible by experiments. Particularly, the simulation results indicated that PE can not only postpone the char formation with less yields, but also increase the order degree of char. The results demonstrate that ReaxFF MD simulation with large-scale models and novel simulation strategy enables to understand the synergistic effects between biomass and polymer deeply by elucidating complex cross-reaction pathways.
