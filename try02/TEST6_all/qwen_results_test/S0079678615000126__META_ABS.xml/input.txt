Chemistry of one dimensional silicon carbide materials: Principle, production, application and future prospects One-dimensional silicon carbide (1D SiC) nanomaterials have shown unusual properties such as extreme high strength, good flexibility, fracture toughness and inverse Hall-petch effect leading to the wide range of applications. However, the fabrication of desired 1D SiC nanomaterials with tailored atomic structures and their assembly into functional devices are still major challenges. In the present review, the recent research and trends towards the formation of SiC nanowires via different routes, their characterization and growth mechanism are discussed. Various aspects of synthesis methods for the bulk production of one dimensional SiC nanomaterials have been discussed with respect to quantity and quality. It is observed that SiC 1D nanostructures grown by different strategies exhibit unusual growth phenomena and properties. The promising myriad applications of 1D SiC nanostructures are highlighted, particularly with reference to surface dependent electronic transduction (gas and biological sensors, potentially useful in biology and medicine as well, for example, in bio-labeling), energy conversion devices (nanomechanical and photovoltaic), microelectronic, nanowire photonics and nanocomposites devices. The important aspects of SiC nanomaterials including various fabrication strategies, knowledge of microstructural evolution, applications and toxicity issues are also covered in the present review. It summarizes and projects the future prospects of 1D SiC nanostructures.
