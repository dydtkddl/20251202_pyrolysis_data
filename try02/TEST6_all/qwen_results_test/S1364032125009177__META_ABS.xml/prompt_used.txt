You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From theory to practice: Evolving methods and challenges in green hydrogen production Hydrogen is emerging as a cornerstone of the clean energy transition, offering a high-density, zero-carbon fuel for decarbonizing electricity, heat, industry, and mobility. Among various pathways, green hydrogen—produced via water or biomass splitting using renewable energy—presents the most sustainable route, with near-zero lifecycle CO2 emissions. This review systematically evaluates key green hydrogen production methods, including electrolysis (alkaline electrolysis, proton exchange membrane electrolysis, solid oxide electrolysis cell, and high-temperature steam electrolysis), chemical routes (biomass gasification, methane pyrolysis, hydrogen sulfide splitting), photo-based techniques (photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic), biological systems, hybrid processes (solar-thermal, wind-to-H2, geothermal), and emerging technologies (plasma decomposition, nuclear-driven, and ocean energy hydrogen). A comparative analysis is provided on efficiency (1–90 %), energy consumption (30–60 kWh/kg H2), cost ($2–6/kg), technology readiness (TRL 3–9), and scalability. While electrolysis remains the frontrunner due to high efficiency and integration with renewables, biohydrogen and methane pyrolysis offer promising synergies with waste valorization and carbon co-products. Advanced solar-thermal and photo-based systems show long-term potential but remain in early development. Despite rapid progress, challenges persist in capital cost, durability (e.g., PEC >1,000 h), and infrastructure integration. Global levelized costs are projected to fall below $2–3/kg by 2030 with policy incentives and falling renewable prices. Accelerating commercialization will require continued research and development in materials, modular system design, and supportive frameworks such as carbon pricing, tax credits, and green hydrogen targets.
