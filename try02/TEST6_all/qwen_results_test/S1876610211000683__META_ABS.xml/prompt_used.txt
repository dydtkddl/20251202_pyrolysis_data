You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical-looping combustion of solid fuels in a 10 kWth pilot–batch tests with five fuels Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a combustion concept with inherent separation of CO2. The process uses a solid oxygen carrier, which consists of metal oxide, to transfer the oxygen from air to fuel. This paper presents findings from batch tests performed in a 10 kWth CLC pilot for solid fuels. The pilot, which is the world’s first chemical-looping combustor for solid fuels, is based on interconnected fluidized-bed technology and features a fuel reactor (FR) and an air reactor (AR) as the principal reaction chambers. In the FR, fuel is gasified with steam whereupon gasification products react with the oxygen carrier to form, ideally, CO2, H2O and SO2. Oxygen-carrier particles exit the FR through a weir and are led to the AR, where they are regenerated to their oxidized state. The pilot has been operated using a natural iron-titanium ore called ilmenite as oxygen carrier. Previous continuous tests have demonstrated a need for batch tests in order to obtain complementary information on system performance. In this study, five fuels were fed to the fuel reactor in batches of 20–25 g at four temperatures; 940 °C, 970 °C, 1000 °C and 1030 °C. By using devolatilized fuel, it was possible to determine (a) oxygen demand associated with syngas from char gasification as well as (b) kinetics of char conversion to gas. Rates of char conversion were found to be temperature dependent, as expected, whereas no temperature dependence was found for the oxygen demand. Activation energies for conversion of char to gas were calculated using Arrhenius plots. The minimum oxygen demand for char was found to be around 5%.
