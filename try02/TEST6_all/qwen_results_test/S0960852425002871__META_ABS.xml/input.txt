Ozone pretreatment and process optimization to improve fuel pellet production from sugarcane bagasse pith Sugarcane bagasse pith (SBP), a byproduct of sugar production, is often discarded or burned as waste, despite its potential as a biofuel feedstock. This study explores ozone pretreatment as a processing step to enhance the physicochemical and pelletizing properties of SBP for biofuel production. Ozone pretreatment, conducted in a fixed-bed reactor, selectively reduced lignin content and improved the biomass’s binding properties, promoting stronger interparticle adhesion during pelletization. Key variables, including moisture content, die temperature, pressure, and ozonation time, were optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with Central Composite Design (CCD), leading to improved pellet density and mechanical strength. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed enhanced thermal stability and combustion efficiency in ozone-treated SBP pellets. These findings demonstrate that ozone pretreatment is a promising, sustainable approach to valorize SBP and optimize biomass pellet production.
