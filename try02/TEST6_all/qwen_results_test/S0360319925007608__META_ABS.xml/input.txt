The application prospect of biomass hydrogen-donors in steam-assisted oil recovery As global population and energy demand rise, the demand for crude oil is steadily increasing. To meet the "low-carbon, high-efficiency" transformation goals, the petroleum industry must make significant adjustments to its industrial chain to achieve "carbon neutrality." This paper proposes a combined approach using in-situ underground upgrading technology and green biomass hydrogen donors. In the process of steam injection, by injecting biomass hydrogen donor and high temperature steam, the in-situ hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil in the formation can be realized, which makes up for the decline of oil recovery in the later stage of thermal recovery technology, and the CO2 produced in the combustion process can be used as thermal fluid to further enhance oil recovery. This method combines refining and mining together as an “underground refinery ”, achieving “pollution reduction and efficiency improvement ”. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the current status of heavy oil thermal recovery technologies. Special attention is given to steam injection-related thermal recovery techniques. Additionally, the paper explores the potential of using biomass as a green hydrogen donors, offering a detailed explanation of the hydrogen supply mechanism and characteristics of biomass, and based on existing research, proposes a technical route for on-site application and future prospects of this technology.
