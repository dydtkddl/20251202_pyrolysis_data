You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The application prospect of biomass hydrogen-donors in steam-assisted oil recovery As global population and energy demand rise, the demand for crude oil is steadily increasing. To meet the "low-carbon, high-efficiency" transformation goals, the petroleum industry must make significant adjustments to its industrial chain to achieve "carbon neutrality." This paper proposes a combined approach using in-situ underground upgrading technology and green biomass hydrogen donors. In the process of steam injection, by injecting biomass hydrogen donor and high temperature steam, the in-situ hydrothermal upgrading of heavy oil in the formation can be realized, which makes up for the decline of oil recovery in the later stage of thermal recovery technology, and the CO2 produced in the combustion process can be used as thermal fluid to further enhance oil recovery. This method combines refining and mining together as an “underground refinery ”, achieving “pollution reduction and efficiency improvement ”. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the current status of heavy oil thermal recovery technologies. Special attention is given to steam injection-related thermal recovery techniques. Additionally, the paper explores the potential of using biomass as a green hydrogen donors, offering a detailed explanation of the hydrogen supply mechanism and characteristics of biomass, and based on existing research, proposes a technical route for on-site application and future prospects of this technology.
