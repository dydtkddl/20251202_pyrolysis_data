You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process intensification of cellulase and bioethanol production from sugarcane bagasse via an integrated saccharification and fermentation process The production of value-added products such as cellulase and ethanol via a consolidated bioprocess could be realized by tapping into the multiple actions of a microbial community. For this purpose, an in situ saccharification and fermentation process through a sequential co-culture white-rot fungus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on NaOH-pretreated sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was investigated. In the present work, white rot fungus plays a role in the production of cellulase enzymes. With the produced cellulase, an in situ saccharification process took place in the reactor to depolymerize pretreated SCB into reducing sugar. The reducing sugar was converted into ethanol via fermentation by S. cerevisiae, which was added into the system sequentially. White rot fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus was selected due to its competency in producing cellulase and reducing sugar production. The operating condition to maximize the production of reducing sugar in situ was obtained through a Central Composite Design method. A total of 3.13 g reducing sugar/100 g SCB was obtained when P. sanguineus was cultivated at 0.6% inoculum loading, 70% moisture content and 4 days. Subsequently, 4.5 g ethanol/100 g SCB was obtained from the in situ saccharification and fermentation system after S. cerevisiae was sequentially inoculated.
