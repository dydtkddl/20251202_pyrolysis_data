You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High surface area mesoporous activated carbon produced from Iraqi reed via pyrolysis assisted H3PO4 activation: Box-Behnken design for surfactant removal Herein, pyrolysis assisted H3PO4 activation was employed to produce activated carbon (AC) from Iraqi reed (IR) biomass waste. After pyrolysis assisted H3PO4 activation of IR, the BET surface area dramatically increased (0.5542 m2/g for IR to 1045.18 m2/g for IRAC). The removal of a model anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, SDBS) by IRAC was studied. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented to investigate the critical adsorption factors (A: dose, 0.02–0.1 g; B: pH, 4–10; C: time, 30–120 min). Adsorption kinetics and equilibrium adsorption data revealed that SDBS adsorption by IRAC fits the pseudo-second order and Langmuir models for kinetic and equilibrium conditions, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity (q max) of IRAC for SDBS was specified to be 121.5 mg/g. This study demonstrates the utility of IR as a biomass precursor for the efficient synthesis of IRAC and its application for removal of anionic surfactants from industrial effluent.
