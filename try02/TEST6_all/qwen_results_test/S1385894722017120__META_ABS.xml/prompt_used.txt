You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Elucidating the role of NiMoS-USY during the hydrotreatment of Kraft lignin Major hurdles in Kraft lignin valorization require selective cleavage of etheric and C–C linkages and subsequent stabilization of the fragments to suppress repolymerization reactions to yield higher monomeric fractions. In this regard, we report the development of efficient NiMo sulfides and ultra-stable Y zeolites for the reductive liquefaction and hydrodeoxygenation of Kraft lignin in a Parr autoclave reactor at 400 °C and 35 bar of H2 (@25 °C). Comparing the activity test without/with catalyst, it is revealed that NiMo sulfides over ultra-stable Y zeolites (silica/alumina = 30) achieved a significant reduction (∼50 %) of the re-polymerized solid residue fraction leading to a detectable liquid product yield of 30.5 wt% with a notable monocyclic and alkylbenzenes selectivity (∼61 wt%). A physical mixture counterpart, consisting of hydrothermally synthesized unsupported NiMoS and Y30, on the other hand, shows lower selectivity for such fractions but higher stabilization of the lignin fragments due to enhanced access to the active sites. Moreover, an extended reaction time with higher catalyst loading of the impregnated NiMoY30 facilitated a remarkable alkylbenzene (72 wt%) selectivity with an increased liquid yield of 38.9 wt% and a reduced solid residue of 16.4 wt%. The reason for the high yield and selectivity over NiMoY30, according to the catalyst characterization (H2-TPR, XPS, TEM) can be ascribed to enhanced stabilization of depolymerized fragments via H2-activation at a lower temperature and high hydrodeoxygenation ability. In addition, the better proximity of the acidic and deoxygenation sites in NiMoY30 was beneficial for suppressing the formation of polycyclic aromatics.
