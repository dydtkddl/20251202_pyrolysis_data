Progress in the catalytic glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate This paper briefly reviews the development history of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the recycling of PET. As one of the most promising way to degrade PET into oligomers and monomers that can be used for the production of high-quality PET, catalytic glycolysis is highlighted in this review. The developments on metal salt, metal oxide and ionic solvent catalysts for glycolysis of PET are systematically summarized, besides, the proposed catalytic mechanisms of ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are presented. The metallic catalysts show high catalytic performance but causing serious environmental pollution and high waste treatment costs, thereby it is proposed that metal-free catalysts, especially ILs and DESs can be the “greener” alternatives to address the PET waste problem. Additionally, the studies related to the glycolysis kinetics are discussed in this review, showing the results that PET glycolysis process consists of heterogeneous and homogeneous depolymerization, and different models should be used to investigate different depolymerization stages in order to obtain a more realistic picture.
