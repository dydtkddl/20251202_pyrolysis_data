You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable fuel production from waste ship oil sludge: A comprehensive technical and socio-economic analysis towards zero-waste discharge Waste ship oil sludge (WSOS) is a classified hazardous waste as it is detrimental to the environment. This work hopes to upcycle the waste as a renewable fuel and optimize its yield. The thermal degradation of WSOS was studied at various heating rates ranging from 5 – 30 °C.min−1 to identify the activation energy and frequency factor. A response surface model for a temperature range 300 – 800 °C, a heating rate of 5 – 40 °C.min−1, and a holding time of 30 – 120 min was used. The central composite design indicated temperature of 550 °C, heating rate of 22.5 °C.min−1, and retention time of 30 min as the optimum operating parameters for WSOS upcycling with a corresponding oil yield of 56.65 %. The fuel properties of the upcycled fuel indicated that the fuel was on par with commercial diesel. A techno-economic analysis indicated a payback period of less than 11 months and the safety index for the process was 4 indicating safe operation. The produced pyro-oil was observed to reduce 1134 kg CO2 per annum. A positive NPV and a high IRR of 79 % indicated that the commercial sale of this pyro-oil as a renewable fuel would be economically feasible.
