Sustainable fuel production from waste ship oil sludge: A comprehensive technical and socio-economic analysis towards zero-waste discharge Waste ship oil sludge (WSOS) is a classified hazardous waste as it is detrimental to the environment. This work hopes to upcycle the waste as a renewable fuel and optimize its yield. The thermal degradation of WSOS was studied at various heating rates ranging from 5 – 30 °C.min−1 to identify the activation energy and frequency factor. A response surface model for a temperature range 300 – 800 °C, a heating rate of 5 – 40 °C.min−1, and a holding time of 30 – 120 min was used. The central composite design indicated temperature of 550 °C, heating rate of 22.5 °C.min−1, and retention time of 30 min as the optimum operating parameters for WSOS upcycling with a corresponding oil yield of 56.65 %. The fuel properties of the upcycled fuel indicated that the fuel was on par with commercial diesel. A techno-economic analysis indicated a payback period of less than 11 months and the safety index for the process was 4 indicating safe operation. The produced pyro-oil was observed to reduce 1134 kg CO2 per annum. A positive NPV and a high IRR of 79 % indicated that the commercial sale of this pyro-oil as a renewable fuel would be economically feasible.
