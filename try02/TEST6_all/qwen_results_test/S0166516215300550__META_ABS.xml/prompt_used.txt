You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of water-soluble organic compounds released from black shales and coals Knowledge of the composition of dissolved organic compounds as well as the main controls on their mobilization from natural organic matter is prerequisite for a comprehensive understanding of the fluid–rock interactions taking place in shale environments and coal seams over both geological and human timescales. In this study, black shales and coals from five different geological settings and covering the maturity range Ro=0.3–2.6% were extracted with deionized water. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) yields were found to decrease rapidly with increasing diagenesis and remain low throughout catagenesis. Four different fractions of DOC have been qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in the study using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Acetate is the dominant low molecular weight organic acid (LMWOA) in all extracts of shales and coals of bituminous rank. The concentrations of individual LMWOA also decrease with increasing maturity of the samples except for acetate extracted from the overmature Posidonia shale from the Haddessen well, which was influenced by hydrothermal brines. The positive correlation between the Oxygen Index (OI) and respective LMWOA yield indicates that OI is a significant factor influencing the extraction of organic acids from shales. The yields of both DOC and individual organic acids normalized to TOC are in the same order of magnitude for coals and shales with the same maturity. However, the extracts of coals tend to contain more aromatic compounds and the molecular masses of most constituents included in macromolecular fractions are higher than for shale extracts. These results suggested that different kerogen types show comparable amounts of DOC being extracted, but different DOC composition. Thus, both the origin of organic matter and thermal maturation progress during deposition has significant influence on water extract composition.
