Characterization of water-soluble organic compounds released from black shales and coals Knowledge of the composition of dissolved organic compounds as well as the main controls on their mobilization from natural organic matter is prerequisite for a comprehensive understanding of the fluid–rock interactions taking place in shale environments and coal seams over both geological and human timescales. In this study, black shales and coals from five different geological settings and covering the maturity range Ro=0.3–2.6% were extracted with deionized water. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) yields were found to decrease rapidly with increasing diagenesis and remain low throughout catagenesis. Four different fractions of DOC have been qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in the study using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Acetate is the dominant low molecular weight organic acid (LMWOA) in all extracts of shales and coals of bituminous rank. The concentrations of individual LMWOA also decrease with increasing maturity of the samples except for acetate extracted from the overmature Posidonia shale from the Haddessen well, which was influenced by hydrothermal brines. The positive correlation between the Oxygen Index (OI) and respective LMWOA yield indicates that OI is a significant factor influencing the extraction of organic acids from shales. The yields of both DOC and individual organic acids normalized to TOC are in the same order of magnitude for coals and shales with the same maturity. However, the extracts of coals tend to contain more aromatic compounds and the molecular masses of most constituents included in macromolecular fractions are higher than for shale extracts. These results suggested that different kerogen types show comparable amounts of DOC being extracted, but different DOC composition. Thus, both the origin of organic matter and thermal maturation progress during deposition has significant influence on water extract composition.
