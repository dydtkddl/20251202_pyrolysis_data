Integrated approach for response surface methodology optimization in biochar and bio-oil production from Moringa seeds: Pyrolysis enhancement with zeolite catalyst Increased demand for renewable energy sources has heightened the research into biomass pyrolysis as a means of producing biochar and bio-oil. Moringa seeds form a potential feedstock due to their high energy content and Properties. This study hypothesizes that optimizing pyrolysis conditions and employing a Zeolite catalyst can enhance biochar and bio-oil yields. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the influence of reaction temperature, time, and catalyst concentration on product yield. The highest yield of biochar was 44.26 % at 300 °C, 20 min, and 14 % catalyst with a calorific value of 21.00 MJ/kg, while the highest yield of bio-oil was 34.67 % at 450 °C, 60 min, and 6 % catalyst loading. Statistical modeling with ANOVA validated the applicability of the model, substantiating the substantial influence of reaction temperature and catalyst concentration on the product trade-off. According to the study, enhancing pyrolysis conditions improves significantly the efficiency of biomass conversion, and it further the use of biochar for carbon sequestration and soil amendment and raises bio-oil's potential for renewable energy.
