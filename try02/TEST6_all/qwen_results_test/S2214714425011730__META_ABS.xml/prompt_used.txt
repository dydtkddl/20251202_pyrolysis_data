You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics from water and synthetic marine water by the electrochemical method Microplastic pollution is a growing global concern, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) posing significant environmental risks due to its persistence, toxicity, and resistance to natural degradation. However, efficient degradation methods remain underexplored. This study investigates the electro-oxidation (EO) of PET microplastics (MPs) using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode in an electrochemical reactor. The process was optimized in a synthetic solution with deionized water, evaluating key parameters such as current intensity, initial microplastic concentration, electrolyte concentration, and anode surface area. The optimized EO process achieved 81 ± 3 % PET degradation in 12 h at current intensity 2 A, with the anode surface area significantly influencing energy consumption. Further EO treatment in synthetic marine water revealed enhanced degradation due to reactive chlorine species (RCS) from naturally abundant NaCl, achieving 92 ± 3 % removal in 4 h without Na₂SO₄ and 95 ± 3 % in 2 h with 0.03 M Na₂SO₄, demonstrating the crucial role of RCS in accelerating the degradation process. Morphological, structural, and elemental analyses using FESEM, FTIR, Raman, and CHNSO confirmed polymer breakdown, while gas chromatography (GC) verified complete degradation into CO₂ and H2O. The optimized EO process exhibited superior efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainable strategy compared to the conventional methods, achieving rapid degradation without generating harmful by-products. The present study offers a feasible solution for reducing plastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems through electrochemical oxidation.
