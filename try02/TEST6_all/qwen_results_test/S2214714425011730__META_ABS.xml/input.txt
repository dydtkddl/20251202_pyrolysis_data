Exploring the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics from water and synthetic marine water by the electrochemical method Microplastic pollution is a growing global concern, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) posing significant environmental risks due to its persistence, toxicity, and resistance to natural degradation. However, efficient degradation methods remain underexplored. This study investigates the electro-oxidation (EO) of PET microplastics (MPs) using a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode in an electrochemical reactor. The process was optimized in a synthetic solution with deionized water, evaluating key parameters such as current intensity, initial microplastic concentration, electrolyte concentration, and anode surface area. The optimized EO process achieved 81 ± 3 % PET degradation in 12 h at current intensity 2 A, with the anode surface area significantly influencing energy consumption. Further EO treatment in synthetic marine water revealed enhanced degradation due to reactive chlorine species (RCS) from naturally abundant NaCl, achieving 92 ± 3 % removal in 4 h without Na₂SO₄ and 95 ± 3 % in 2 h with 0.03 M Na₂SO₄, demonstrating the crucial role of RCS in accelerating the degradation process. Morphological, structural, and elemental analyses using FESEM, FTIR, Raman, and CHNSO confirmed polymer breakdown, while gas chromatography (GC) verified complete degradation into CO₂ and H2O. The optimized EO process exhibited superior efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainable strategy compared to the conventional methods, achieving rapid degradation without generating harmful by-products. The present study offers a feasible solution for reducing plastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems through electrochemical oxidation.
