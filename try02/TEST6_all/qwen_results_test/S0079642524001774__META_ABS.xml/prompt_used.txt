You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in heteroatom-doped/hierarchical porous carbon materials: Synthesis, design and potential applications Heteroatom-doped porous carbon or hierarchically porous carbon materials (HPCMs) have been widely used in several fields such as adsorption and separation, organic catalytic processes, sensors, and energy production and conservation. To develop HPCMs with unique applications, carbon precursors must be carefully selected to ensure optimal performance. Polymer materials have significant potential as intermediates due to their adaptable structure, adjustable chemical compositions, and diverse processing methods, allowing them to maintain favorable textures during carbonization. This detailed review basically provides an overview of the advancements made in the field of HPCMs. It focuses on the techniques used to synthesize and regulate the porosity, the impact of heteroatom doping, structures and the influence of morphology on the performance, dimensional aspects of these materials. Additionally, it explores many applications associated with these advancements. During the first stage, a thorough investigation was carried out to analyze the approaches used for the synthesis and characterization of HPCMs. The objective was to gain insights into the process of discovering the atomic-level structure of these materials. In addition, the morphology of HPCMs plays a vital role in determining their spectrum of functionalities. As a result, there has been a significant amount of study focused onto the modification and control of the specific patterns of such materials. The research teams successfully fabricated multipurpose materials in various forms such as spheres, fibers, sheets, and membranes, using template techniques and proficient polymer synthesis methods. These composites were designed for applications in the fields of photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, adsorption/separation and energy conversion. In conclusion, we offer a broad analysis of the primary use of HPCMs across diverse fields including supercapacitors, batteries, absorption processes, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photo/electro carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reactions. This overview aims to give a more complex understanding of the subject matter. The limitations regarding such materials revolve on their ability to be synthesized on large scale, while simultaneously exhibiting robust electrocatalytic and dynamical stability, as well as flexibility.
