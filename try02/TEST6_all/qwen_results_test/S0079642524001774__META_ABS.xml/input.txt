Recent advances in heteroatom-doped/hierarchical porous carbon materials: Synthesis, design and potential applications Heteroatom-doped porous carbon or hierarchically porous carbon materials (HPCMs) have been widely used in several fields such as adsorption and separation, organic catalytic processes, sensors, and energy production and conservation. To develop HPCMs with unique applications, carbon precursors must be carefully selected to ensure optimal performance. Polymer materials have significant potential as intermediates due to their adaptable structure, adjustable chemical compositions, and diverse processing methods, allowing them to maintain favorable textures during carbonization. This detailed review basically provides an overview of the advancements made in the field of HPCMs. It focuses on the techniques used to synthesize and regulate the porosity, the impact of heteroatom doping, structures and the influence of morphology on the performance, dimensional aspects of these materials. Additionally, it explores many applications associated with these advancements. During the first stage, a thorough investigation was carried out to analyze the approaches used for the synthesis and characterization of HPCMs. The objective was to gain insights into the process of discovering the atomic-level structure of these materials. In addition, the morphology of HPCMs plays a vital role in determining their spectrum of functionalities. As a result, there has been a significant amount of study focused onto the modification and control of the specific patterns of such materials. The research teams successfully fabricated multipurpose materials in various forms such as spheres, fibers, sheets, and membranes, using template techniques and proficient polymer synthesis methods. These composites were designed for applications in the fields of photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, adsorption/separation and energy conversion. In conclusion, we offer a broad analysis of the primary use of HPCMs across diverse fields including supercapacitors, batteries, absorption processes, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis and photo/electro carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reactions. This overview aims to give a more complex understanding of the subject matter. The limitations regarding such materials revolve on their ability to be synthesized on large scale, while simultaneously exhibiting robust electrocatalytic and dynamical stability, as well as flexibility.
