Insight into the thermal decomposition behaviors and kinetic characteristic of the pyrolysis and combustion of organic components in end-of-life photovoltaic modules To elucidate the thermal decomposition behavior and kinetic characteristics of organic components in end-of-life photovoltaic modules, including ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and Tedlar-PET-Tedlar (TPT), model-free method and the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) were employed. The model-free kinetic analysis revealed that the activation energies for the combustion of EVA and TPT were significantly lower than those for their pyrolysis. DAEM simulations indicated that the pyrolysis of EVA and TPT followed two-Gaussian and one-Gaussian distributions, respectively, while their combustion processes were best described by three-Gaussian and two-Gaussian distributions. These models effectively divided the thermal decomposition into multiple reactive stages, offering deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms of EVA and TPT. And, the models were validated and demonstrated reliable predictive capabilities for thermal decomposition at varying heating rates. Furthermore, the EVA and TPT thermal decomposition paths were also provided. This research will contribute to the efficient disposal of end-of-life photovoltaic modules and provide precise kinetic parameters.
