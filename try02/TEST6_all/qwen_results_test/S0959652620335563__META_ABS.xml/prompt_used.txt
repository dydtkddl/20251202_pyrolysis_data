You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exergy analysis of a pilot-scale reactor using wood chips A pilot size reactor has been tested to examine the suitability of the design for effective gas generation. The qualitative assessment of a reactor is considered to be one of the selection criteria for the thermochemical conversion. The pyrolysis reactor is subjected to operate for the temperature histories of 32–400 °C and 33–600 °C, respectively. The chemical exergy and the thermal efficiency are calculated for both operating ranges. The thermal efficiency of the reactor is found to be 46.32%; whereas the chemical exergy of the raw gas is 75.77% while pyrolysing at 600 °C, which is relatively 17% higher than that obtained at 400 °C. The additional burden on the thermal system due to the moisture has reduced the thermal efficiency of the reactor by 5.85% at 600 °C, whereas it is 6.22% for carrying out thermal decomposition at 400 °C. The gas yield for the given reactor is decreased by 0.77% while operating at 400 °C, whereas the char yield is increased by 6.73%. The proposed design is more efficient for higher temperature regimes and for dried biomass. The lumped system analysis is adopted to determine the loss for the transient condition. The heat transfer in the transient condition is measured for the fixed bed of biomass by the Biot and the Fourier numbers. The external heat transfer controls the overall rate of reaction. The intraparticle temperature is homogenous throughout the process though it may depend on the external heat condition. Furthermore, the various losses encountered during pyrolysis make the system energy-intensive. The objective of this work is to provide a clean generation of energy, which can be attained by improving exergetic content of the reactor.
