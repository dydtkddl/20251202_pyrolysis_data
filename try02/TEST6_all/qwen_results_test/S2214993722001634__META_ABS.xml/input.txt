Exploring how lignin promoting the co-pyrolysis with polylactic acid: Artificial neural network modeling, kinetic analysis and product distribution Toward the development of a suitable method for the upcycling of lignin from second-generation bioethanol production and waste polylactic acid (PLA), the recovery of lactide and biofuels from the pyrolysis of different proportions of lignin and PLA was investigated. Co-pyrolysis was found to be beneficial for the upcycling of the two products because the strong synergistic effects between PLA and lignin reduced the energy input required for the co-pyrolysis and increased the yield of bio-oil. The best results were achieved for a mixture of 75% PLA and 25% lignin. The bio-oil production increased by up to 111.3%, whereas the production of gaseous products like carbon monoxide and aldehydes decreased significantly. Bio-oil was composed of liquid and light-yellow wax, which was identified as lactide via 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis after its isolation and purification from bio-oil by filtration. A Py-GC/MS analysis showed that the yield of lactide increased up to 26.24% during co-pyrolysis compared with that of PLA pyrolysis, even though the mass fraction of PLA was lower in the PLA/lignin mixture. The average activation energy of a sample composed of 25 wt% lignin and 75 wt% PLA (129.97 kJ/mol) was 27.9% lower than that of PLA (180.35 kJ/mol) and 44.6% lower than that of lignin (233.59 kJ/mol). Moreover, co-pyrolysis could effectively reduce the external input energy. In addition, an artificial neural network analysis using three different algorithms was performed to validate and optimize the thermogravimetry analysis results.
