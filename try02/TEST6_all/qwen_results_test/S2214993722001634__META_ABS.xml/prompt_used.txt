You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring how lignin promoting the co-pyrolysis with polylactic acid: Artificial neural network modeling, kinetic analysis and product distribution Toward the development of a suitable method for the upcycling of lignin from second-generation bioethanol production and waste polylactic acid (PLA), the recovery of lactide and biofuels from the pyrolysis of different proportions of lignin and PLA was investigated. Co-pyrolysis was found to be beneficial for the upcycling of the two products because the strong synergistic effects between PLA and lignin reduced the energy input required for the co-pyrolysis and increased the yield of bio-oil. The best results were achieved for a mixture of 75% PLA and 25% lignin. The bio-oil production increased by up to 111.3%, whereas the production of gaseous products like carbon monoxide and aldehydes decreased significantly. Bio-oil was composed of liquid and light-yellow wax, which was identified as lactide via 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis after its isolation and purification from bio-oil by filtration. A Py-GC/MS analysis showed that the yield of lactide increased up to 26.24% during co-pyrolysis compared with that of PLA pyrolysis, even though the mass fraction of PLA was lower in the PLA/lignin mixture. The average activation energy of a sample composed of 25 wt% lignin and 75 wt% PLA (129.97 kJ/mol) was 27.9% lower than that of PLA (180.35 kJ/mol) and 44.6% lower than that of lignin (233.59 kJ/mol). Moreover, co-pyrolysis could effectively reduce the external input energy. In addition, an artificial neural network analysis using three different algorithms was performed to validate and optimize the thermogravimetry analysis results.
