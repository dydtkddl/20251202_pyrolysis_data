Some empirical considerations on the pyrolysis-gas chromatographic conditions required to obtain characteristic and reliable high-resolution pyrograms for polymer samples The fundamental pyrolysis-gas chromatographic conditions required to obtain characteristic and reliable high-resolution pyrograms for various polymeric materials are discussed on the basis of empirical data. Among various experimental factors discussed are the additional maintenance heating effect encountered in conventional pulse-mode pyrolyzers, the nature of the carrier gas, the inertness of capillary column materials and the protection of the inert capillary column from tarry, less volatile and/or reactive pyrolytic products.
