Regulating the anchoring structure to enhance thermostability of Ru sub-nano clusters on Al-based supports for efficient CO bonds hydrogenolysis Heterogeneous catalysts with highly dispersed active metal species have found wide applications in the catalytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, owing to the inherent advantages in metal atom efficiency. However, it is still confronted with the challenge of developing efficient strategies to achieve enhanced thermostability of the highly dispersed metal under harsh conditions. In this work, Ru species are supported by two different aluminum-based materials (i.e., γ-AlOOH and γ-Al2O3) that provide distinct anchoring sites for Ru. Complementary characterizations combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that, compared with the triply bridging AlO site of γ-Al2O3, the doubly bridging AlO site of AlOOH exhibits more intense electronic interaction with Ru species. Consequently, this doubly bridging AlO site as the anchoring site provides sufficient thermal resistance to immobilize the sub-nanometer Ru species under the high-temperature aging condition. The maintained high dispersion of Ru on AlOOH sustains the high activity (5.2 min−1) and selectivity (75 %) in the production of aromatics during the hydrotreating of diphenyl ether. This work may contribute to the catalyst design for manipulating the surface-anchoring structure to regulate thermostability and dispersion of supported metal catalysts.
