You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidative and pyrolytic decomposition of an evaporated stream of 2,4,6-tribromophenol over hematite: A prevailing scenario during thermal recycling of e-waste Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) constitute a major load in the polymeric fraction of e-waste. Degradation of BFRs-laden plastics over transition metal oxides is currently deployed as a mainstream strategy in the disposal and treatment of the non-metallic segment of e-waste. However, interaction of pyrolysis’s products of BFRs with transition metal oxides is well-known to facilitate the formation of notorious pollutants. Despite recent progress to comprehend the germane chemistry of this interaction, several important pertinent aspects remain to be addressed. To fill in this gap, an integrated experimental and simulation account of the pyrolytic and oxidative decomposition of a gaseous stream of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP) over hematite (Fe2O3) has been reported herein. TBP is utilized as a model compounds of BFRs as their most common formulations include brominated phenolic rings. Overall, hematite entails a rather low cracking capacity under pyrolytic conditions. Analysis of condensate products indicates that oxidative degradation of a gaseous stream of TBP results mainly in the formation of brominated alkanes such as bromoethane and bromo-pentane. Likewise, Ion chromatography (IC) measurements disclosed a noticeable reduction in the concentrations of escaped HBr. Transformation of iron oxides into iron bromides (possibly in the form of FeBr2) during pyrolysis and combustion operations is evident through XRD measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations map out important reactions pathways that operate in the initial degradation of the TBP molecule. From a broader perspective, outlined results shall be instrumental to precisely assess the effectiveness of using iron oxides in thermal catalytic recycling of e-waste and the likely emission of brominated toxicants.
