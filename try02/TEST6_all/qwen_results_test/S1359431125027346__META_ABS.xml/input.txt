Performance analysis of a multi-channel membrane reactor for solar thermochemical ammonia decomposition Solar-driven ammonia decomposition is a promising route to zero-carbon hydrogen. To enhance the hydrogen yield from this thermochemical process, this study proposes a novel multi-channel membrane reactor directly heated by concentrated solar radiation. A fully coupled three-dimensional numerical model was developed that integrates realistic solar flux distributions, heat/mass transport in the porous catalyst bed, intrinsic ammonia kinetics, and selective hydrogen permeation through the membrane. The model was employed to quantify the influence of the number of channels, the hydrogen partial-pressure control strategy (vacuum pumping or sweep gas), and solar irradiation (400–1100 W m−2) on reactor performance. Relative to a single-channel design, a four-channel configuration raises the hydrogen recovery rate by 13.2 % and the ammonia conversion rate by 5.9 %. Vacuum pumping outperforms the sweep gas approach, boosting ammonia conversion by up to 32.5 % and hydrogen recovery by 45 %. Increasing the solar irradiance from 400 to 1100 W m−2 elevates ammonia conversion by 56.6 %, whereas hydrogen recovery rises by only 25.8 %. These findings demonstrate that maximizing the number of membrane channels and adopting vacuum pumping technology are effective strategies for intensifying ammonia decomposition and hydrogen production, providing important guidance for the optimization of solar ammonia-decomposition reactors.
