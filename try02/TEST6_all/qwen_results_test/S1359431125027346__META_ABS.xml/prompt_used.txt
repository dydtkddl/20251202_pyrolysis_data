You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance analysis of a multi-channel membrane reactor for solar thermochemical ammonia decomposition Solar-driven ammonia decomposition is a promising route to zero-carbon hydrogen. To enhance the hydrogen yield from this thermochemical process, this study proposes a novel multi-channel membrane reactor directly heated by concentrated solar radiation. A fully coupled three-dimensional numerical model was developed that integrates realistic solar flux distributions, heat/mass transport in the porous catalyst bed, intrinsic ammonia kinetics, and selective hydrogen permeation through the membrane. The model was employed to quantify the influence of the number of channels, the hydrogen partial-pressure control strategy (vacuum pumping or sweep gas), and solar irradiation (400–1100 W m−2) on reactor performance. Relative to a single-channel design, a four-channel configuration raises the hydrogen recovery rate by 13.2 % and the ammonia conversion rate by 5.9 %. Vacuum pumping outperforms the sweep gas approach, boosting ammonia conversion by up to 32.5 % and hydrogen recovery by 45 %. Increasing the solar irradiance from 400 to 1100 W m−2 elevates ammonia conversion by 56.6 %, whereas hydrogen recovery rises by only 25.8 %. These findings demonstrate that maximizing the number of membrane channels and adopting vacuum pumping technology are effective strategies for intensifying ammonia decomposition and hydrogen production, providing important guidance for the optimization of solar ammonia-decomposition reactors.
