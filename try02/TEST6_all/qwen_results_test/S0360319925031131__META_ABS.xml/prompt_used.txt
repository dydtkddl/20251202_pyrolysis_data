You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective regulation of syngas from biomass pyrolysis using LaFe1-xCoxO3 catalysts supported on calcined dolomite Biomass, as the only renewable carbon source, is vital for carbon mitigation. This study investigates biomass pyrolysis gas reforming using a novel composite catalyst: Co-doped LaFeO3 perovskite (sol-gel synthesized) on calcined dolomite. The dolomite support was chosen for its cost-effectiveness and superior tar cracking, increasing base gas yield. The Co-doped perovskite was selected for its preferential CO oxidation, promoting selective H2 formation. Experiments in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor demonstrated that temperature significantly influences gas yield, whereas steam rate requires optimization. Optimal Co substitution (X = 0.6) yielded 29.65 mmol/g H2. Response surface analysis predicted 44.599 % H2 under optimal conditions. Characterization (XRD, SEM, XPS) revealed that Co doping induces lattice distortion and oxygen vacancies, enhancing oxygen mobility and catalytic performance. This synergistic catalyst offers an efficient, economical strategy for H2-rich syngas production from biomass.
