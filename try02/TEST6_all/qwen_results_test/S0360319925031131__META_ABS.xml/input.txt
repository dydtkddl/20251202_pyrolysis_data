Selective regulation of syngas from biomass pyrolysis using LaFe1-xCoxO3 catalysts supported on calcined dolomite Biomass, as the only renewable carbon source, is vital for carbon mitigation. This study investigates biomass pyrolysis gas reforming using a novel composite catalyst: Co-doped LaFeO3 perovskite (sol-gel synthesized) on calcined dolomite. The dolomite support was chosen for its cost-effectiveness and superior tar cracking, increasing base gas yield. The Co-doped perovskite was selected for its preferential CO oxidation, promoting selective H2 formation. Experiments in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor demonstrated that temperature significantly influences gas yield, whereas steam rate requires optimization. Optimal Co substitution (X = 0.6) yielded 29.65 mmol/g H2. Response surface analysis predicted 44.599 % H2 under optimal conditions. Characterization (XRD, SEM, XPS) revealed that Co doping induces lattice distortion and oxygen vacancies, enhancing oxygen mobility and catalytic performance. This synergistic catalyst offers an efficient, economical strategy for H2-rich syngas production from biomass.
