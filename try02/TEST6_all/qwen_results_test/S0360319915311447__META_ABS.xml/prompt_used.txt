You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic gasification of lignite in supercritical water with Ru/CeO2–ZrO2 A series of CeO2–ZrO2 (CZ) supported Ru catalysts were prepared and employed to catalytic gasification of lignite in supercritical water (SCW). The influences of Ru content, catalyst loading, reaction temperature and feed concentration on gasification of lignite were investigated. Results indicated that Ru2/CZ shows high activity for gasification of lignite and hydrogen production. At 500 °C and 17 min with a 2 wt% loading of lignite and a 2 g/g catalyst loading, carbon gasification efficiency about 86% has been achieved and the highest H2 yield (29.24 mol/kg) has been produced, representing nearly 21-fold enhancement of yield compared to that in the noncatalytic case. The kinetic study in terms of overall reaction rate was investigated and the activation energy Ea is 130 ± 26 kJ/mol. Furthermore, catalyst recycling experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the stability of Ru2/CZ catalyst. The results and XPS data indicate that ZrO2 enhance the stability of the catalyst. Thus, the Ru2/CZ catalyst seems to be a promising material for SCWG of lignite for gas fuels, especially for hydrogen.
