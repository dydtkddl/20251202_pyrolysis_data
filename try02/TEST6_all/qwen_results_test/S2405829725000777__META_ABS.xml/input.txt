Prospect of bismuth and its compounds in sodium-ion batteries: A Review Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) possess the great potential to become the next generation of battery systems due to the abundant sodium resources and similar chemistry to that of lithium-ion counterparts. Mature cathode materials suitable for lithium-ion battery (LIBs) have been applied in SIBs. Unfortunately, only a few anode materials are available for Na+ storage due to the large size of sodium ions, and hence anodes with high capacity and good cycle performance still need to be explored. Among various anode materials, bismuth and its compounds have become one of the anode candidates for SIBs due to their high capacity (385 mAh g-1), high volume energy density (3800 mAh cm-3), excellent rate capability (> 100 C), and low redox potential of ∼0.55 V (vs. Na/Na+) through a three-electrons alloying reactions. This review begins with a systematic discussion of the sodium storage mechanisms of Bi-based anode and then interpret the ultrafast rate performance of bismuth metal. Subsequently, we present a critical overview of the preparation method, structure construction, electrochemical performance of different types of bismuth-based anodes. To provide a visionary prospective, we describe the operating principles and the future challenges of bismuth-based materials, and assess these anode materials under commercial battery configurations.
