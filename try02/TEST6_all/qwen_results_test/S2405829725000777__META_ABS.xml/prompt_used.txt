You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prospect of bismuth and its compounds in sodium-ion batteries: A Review Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) possess the great potential to become the next generation of battery systems due to the abundant sodium resources and similar chemistry to that of lithium-ion counterparts. Mature cathode materials suitable for lithium-ion battery (LIBs) have been applied in SIBs. Unfortunately, only a few anode materials are available for Na+ storage due to the large size of sodium ions, and hence anodes with high capacity and good cycle performance still need to be explored. Among various anode materials, bismuth and its compounds have become one of the anode candidates for SIBs due to their high capacity (385 mAh g-1), high volume energy density (3800 mAh cm-3), excellent rate capability (> 100 C), and low redox potential of ∼0.55 V (vs. Na/Na+) through a three-electrons alloying reactions. This review begins with a systematic discussion of the sodium storage mechanisms of Bi-based anode and then interpret the ultrafast rate performance of bismuth metal. Subsequently, we present a critical overview of the preparation method, structure construction, electrochemical performance of different types of bismuth-based anodes. To provide a visionary prospective, we describe the operating principles and the future challenges of bismuth-based materials, and assess these anode materials under commercial battery configurations.
