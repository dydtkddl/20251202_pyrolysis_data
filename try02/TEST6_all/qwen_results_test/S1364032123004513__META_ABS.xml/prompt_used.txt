You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emulsion-derived porous carbon-based materials for energy and environmental applications Porous carbons have spurred tremendous interest as cutting-edge materials for diverse energy and environmental applications. To this end, hard and soft templating routes have developed various porous carbon-based materials with uniform and ordered porosities. Notwithstanding, the pores of carbons obtained via most of these preparation methods are vulnerable to blockage because their tunability is limited only to the micro-mesoscale size regime. This problem, in turn, makes the inner parts of such porous carbons inaccessible to the reactive species, thus hampering their community-scale adoption. To overcome this daunting challenge, emulsion-based approaches (i.e., emulsion polymerization, emulsion templating, and emulsion freeze drying) have turned out to be intriguing to endow the derived carbons with hierarchically-organized pores spanning over multiple-scale, large V p, and multidimensional transport pathways of particular interest. These attributes of such porous carbon materials have unfolded many prospects for broad-spectrum applications. This article systematically summarizes the synthetic progress of the emulsion-derived porous carbon-based NSs, particles, spheres, and monoliths. The applications section showcases their performance in energy storage (LIBs, LSBs, LOBs, ZABs, and electrodes for supercapacitors) and environmental remediation (CO2 capture, dye adsorption, herbicide separation, and oil/organic solvent removal). Despite significant advancement, plenty of room is available to develop more promising new emulsion-derived porous carbons. Nonetheless, there is still a long way to go before materializing the dream of industrial-scale energy and environmental applications of such emulsion-derived porous carbons.
