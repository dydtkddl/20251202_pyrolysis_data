Closed-loop recyclable wood-plastic composite as a sustainable alternative to wood: A solution for utilizing wood waste and promoting carbon sequestration Utilizing wood waste to construct high-performance materials and partially replace natural wood applications is a feasible solution to address the overconsumption of forest resources and enhance carbon sequestration. A closed-loop recyclable wood-plastic composite (WPC) with high wood waste flour (WF) content (70 wt%) was developed using poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) as the polymer component. The two components in WF/PPDO WPC form an interesting symbiotic relationship owing to their strong interactions. PPDO serves as “binder” for WF and integrates them as a whole, whilst WF protects PPDO from hydrolysis, therefore substantially prolonging service life. The comprehensive performance of the WF/PPDO WPC (such as WF content, mechanical properties, hardness, and water absorption) is comparable or better than natural wood or commercial WPC. Moreover, WF/PPDO can be closed-loop recycled almost 100 % to its initial raw materials. The relatively low carbon footprint of WF/PPDO (1.06 kg CO2e/kg of materials) was confirmed by life-cycle assessment (LCA). In addition, the facile preparation of WF/PPDO is scalable and widely applicable to other cellulose-containing waste.
