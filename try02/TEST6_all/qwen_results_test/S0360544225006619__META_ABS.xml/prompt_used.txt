You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of corn stalk and polyethylene at a gas phase contacting mode and aromatization mechanism study The co-pyrolysis of “hydrogen-deficient” biomass and plastics is an efficient method to produce aromatic-rich bio-oils. However, the distinct pyrolysis characteristics and complex interactions between biomass and plastics in conventional reactors limited aromatics production and synergy study. A modified Y-shaped tube reactor was therefore established, in which corn straw and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were placed in two branches respectively, with a co-pyrolysis ZSM-5 catalyst at the junction for co-pyrolysis. Firstly, optimal pyrolysis conditions (temperature, catalyst-to-feedstock ratio) were studied for each feedstock to boost furans/light olefins production. As a result, the Diels-Alder reaction raised the aromatics to 21.7 area% in non-catalytic trial. The addition of co-pyrolysis ZSM-5(60) further strengthened this reaction and doubled aromatics to 44.8 area%. It is noteworthy that even with the same catalyst (ZSM-5(60)), the gas-phase contact mode outperformed the conventional co-pyrolysis mode (39.4 area%) in aromatic generation. Subsequently, the synergy between HDPE and cellulose/hemicellulose/lignin was respectively investigated. Results showed that the Diels-Alder reaction between furans and light olefins contributed most to aromatics production, followed by the aromatization of HDPE-derived light olefins.
