You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Single exposure of food-derived polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics profoundly affects gut microbiome in an in vitro colon model Microplastics (MPs) are widespread contaminants highly persistent in the environment and present in matrices to which humans are extensively exposed, including food and beverages. MP ingestion occurs in adults and children and is becoming an emerging public health issue. The gastrointestinal system is the most exposed to MP contamination, which can alter its physiology starting from changes in the microbiome. This study investigates by an omic approach the impact of a single intake of a mixture of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) MPs on the ecology and metabolic activity of the colon microbiota of healthy volunteers, in an in vitro intestinal model. PE and PS MPs were pooled together in a homogeneous mix, digested with the INFOGEST system, and fermented with MICODE (multi-unit in vitro colon model) at loads that by literature correspond to the possible intake of food-derived MPs of a single meal. Results demonstrated that MPs induced an opportunistic bacteria overgrowth (Enterobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio spp., Clostridium group I and Atopobium − Collinsella group) and a contextual reduction on abundances of all the beneficial taxa analyzed, with the sole exception of Lactobacillales. This microbiota shift was consistent with the changes recorded in the bacterial metabolic activity.
