You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel conversion of polyethylene terephthalate into aromatic amines production through nitrogen-rich pyrolysis using Zn/CuCo₂O₄ spinel catalyst Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics under nitrogen-rich conditions to produce nitrogenous compounds represents a highly promising technological approach. It can achieve high-value conversion of waste plastics and expand the synthesis process of nitrogenous products. This work uses polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the raw material and urea as the nitrogen source to produce aromatic amines, and prepares Zn/CuCo2O4 spinel catalysts to enhance the above synthesis process. The results indicate that the optimal mass ratio of PET and urea is 1:1, where the relative content of nitrogenous compounds in the liquid product reaches 86.69 %, and the selectivity of aromatic amines reaches 52.48 %. The addition of the spinel catalyst significantly improves the selectivity of aromatic amines. Compared with the CuCo2O4 catalyst, ZnCo2O4 exhibits superior catalytic conversion performance. The optimal addition ratio of the ZnCo2O4 catalyst is 15 %, and the optimal pyrolysis temperature is 550 ℃. Under these conditions, the selectivity of aromatic amines increases by 11.11 % compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. In addition, the obtained solid residue containing the used catalyst is considered as a potential adsorbent and can be applied in water treatment. It has significant removal ability for methylene blue dye. This work not only provides a feasible approach for the production of aromatic amines, but also provides important support for the high-value utilization of waste plastics.
