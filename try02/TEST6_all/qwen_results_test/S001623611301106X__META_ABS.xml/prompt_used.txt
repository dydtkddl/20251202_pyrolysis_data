You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production and fuel quality upgradation of pyrolytic bio-oil from Jatropha Curcas de-oiled seed cake The work is aimed at conversion of non-edible jatropha curcas de-oiled seed cake (the residue left after extraction of oil from the seed) into bio-oil and bio-char through pyrolysis process. A fluidized bed pyrolysis system with maximum feed rate of 12g/min was designed and fabricated. The particle size range, sweep gas flow rate and operating temperature were optimized as 0.5mm–0.99mm, 8L/min and 450°C respectively for obtaining maximum yield of bio-oil (48%) and bio-char (35.1%). The crude bio-oil has lower viscosity (1.98cSt), higher moisture content (31%) and higher density (1040kg/m3) as compared to commercial petro-diesel. The crude bio-oil was upgraded to make it suitable for engine application. The moisture content of the crude bio-oil was removed about 3% by weight using Na2SO4 as a reagent. The heavier fractions, tar, moisture and inorganic materials were removed from the crude oil by distillation in the temperature range of 40°C–80°C. The density, viscosity and moisture content of the upgraded bio-oil decreased to 1030kg/m3, 1.77cSt and 25% respectively.
