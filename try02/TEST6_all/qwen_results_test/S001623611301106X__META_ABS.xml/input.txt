Production and fuel quality upgradation of pyrolytic bio-oil from Jatropha Curcas de-oiled seed cake The work is aimed at conversion of non-edible jatropha curcas de-oiled seed cake (the residue left after extraction of oil from the seed) into bio-oil and bio-char through pyrolysis process. A fluidized bed pyrolysis system with maximum feed rate of 12g/min was designed and fabricated. The particle size range, sweep gas flow rate and operating temperature were optimized as 0.5mm–0.99mm, 8L/min and 450°C respectively for obtaining maximum yield of bio-oil (48%) and bio-char (35.1%). The crude bio-oil has lower viscosity (1.98cSt), higher moisture content (31%) and higher density (1040kg/m3) as compared to commercial petro-diesel. The crude bio-oil was upgraded to make it suitable for engine application. The moisture content of the crude bio-oil was removed about 3% by weight using Na2SO4 as a reagent. The heavier fractions, tar, moisture and inorganic materials were removed from the crude oil by distillation in the temperature range of 40°C–80°C. The density, viscosity and moisture content of the upgraded bio-oil decreased to 1030kg/m3, 1.77cSt and 25% respectively.
