Removal of food dyes using biological materials via adsorption: A review It is alarming that synthetic food dyes (FD) are widely used in various industries and that these facilities discharge their wastewater into the environment without treating it. FDs mixed into industrial wastewater pose a threat to the environment and human health. Therefore, removing FDs from wastewater is very important. This review explores the burgeoning field of FD removal from wastewater through adsorption using biological materials (BMs). By synthesizing a wealth of research findings, this comprehensive review elucidates the diverse array of BMs employed, ranging from algae and fungi to agricultural residues and microbial biomass. Furthermore, this review investigates challenges in practical applications, such as process optimization and scalability, offering insights into bridging the gap between laboratory successes and real-world implementations. Harnessing the remarkable adsorptive potential of BMs, this review presents a roadmap toward transformative solutions for FD removal, promising cleaner and safer production practices in the food and beverage industry.
