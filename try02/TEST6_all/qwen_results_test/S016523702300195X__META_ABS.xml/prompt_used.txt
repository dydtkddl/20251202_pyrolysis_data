You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nickel promoted Si-rich ZSM-5 nanocatalyst remarkably converts LDPE plastic waste to gasoline range hydrocarbons in a dual-bed semi-batch reactor at atmospheric pressure Catalytic pyrolysis is an environmentally friendly recycling method, which has attracted remarkable attention due to worldwide issues of the production and accumulation of plastic wastes. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was carried out in a dual-bed semi-batch reactor over the Si-rich Ni/ZSM-5 nanocatalyst at atmospheric pressure. The parent nanocatalyst was prepared by hydrothermal technique and modified with nickel promoter (0–25 wt%). The properties of the nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM, EDX, TEM, BET, NH3-TPD, and TG-DTA techniques. The results showed the high crystallinity, spherical particles, and high specific surface area (376 m2g−1). The impact of operational conditions was evaluated to maximize the production of the high value-added compounds. The high percentage of the Ni promoter (25 wt%) led to the highest amount of gasoline range hydrocarbons (61%). The appropriate operational conditions were temperature of 525 °C, catalyst to plastic ratio of 1:20, and 2.5 ml min−1 nitrogen flow rate, resulting in the best product distribution: aromatics (39.4%), olefins (28.3%), and paraffins (15%). The reusability of the nanocatalyst showed high performance and more aromatic production. The characterization results of the used nanocatalyst confirmed the high stability through the pyrolysis reaction and lack of significant structural defect. The developed nanocatalyst represented the high activity through the pyrolysis of the real LDPE plastic waste, including the major product distribution in the gasoline range hydrocarbons.
