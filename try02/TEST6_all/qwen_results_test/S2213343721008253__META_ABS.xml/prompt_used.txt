You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodeoxygenation of phenol and pyrolysis oil using Raney Ni and IL/Zr-SBA-15 catalysts A novel IL/Zr-SBA-15 (n(Si)/n(Zr)= 2,10,40) catalysts were synthesized, and characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption–desorption measurement and DSC/TG. The results showed that ionic liquid (IL) has been successfully immobilized on the surface of Zr-SBA-15, and the ordered mesoporous structure can also be well preserved, even after chemical grafting reaction. Using water as a solvent, Raney Ni and IL/Zr-SBA-15 composite catalysts were investigated by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol. The synergy of acid and metal catalysts can effectively catalyze phenol as a model compound for pyrolysis oil by tandem reactions. Under optimum reaction condition, the mean selectivity and yield of cyclohexane was 81.08% and 76.26%, respectively. The catalyst still provided satisfactory results after 5 runs. With reference to the study of phenol, HDO was carried out on the coconut clothes pyrolysis oil. The process conditions were optimized by response surface methodology. In addition, it is concluded that reaction conditions affect the order of naphthenes component content as reaction temperature>reaction time>hydrogen pressure. As a result, the content of naphthenes components in the bio-fuel reaches 34.43% and the HHV of 37.58 MJ/kg, indicating that this catalyst also has a good effect on HDO of the pyrolysis oil.
