Kinetic evaluations of individual hydrocarbon (C1C4) generation by nonisothermal source rock pyrolysis Nonisothermal pyrolysis experiments on an immature Toarcian oil shale sample provided evolution profiles of individual alkanes (C1C4) and alkenes (C2C4). Using the activation energies and pre-exponential Arrhenius factors assessed by application of the single-reaction model (simple nonisothermal kinetics), the extrapolation to geological heating rates resulted in hydrocarbon formation temperatures that appeared to be too low according to organic geochemical concepts. Evaluation of the experimental evolution profiles with a kinetic model, implying a discrete activation energy distribution, yielded more probable kinetic parameters and geological hydrocarbon formation temperatures commonly accepted for natural gas generation.
