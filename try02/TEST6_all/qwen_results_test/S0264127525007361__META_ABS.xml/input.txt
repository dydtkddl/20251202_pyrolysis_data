The latest perspective on fabrication strategies of smart implants for bone tissue repair and regeneration Repairing bone tissue by artificial implants is always the most effective strategy to clinically treat bone injuries including in orthopedics and stomatology. To date, the demand for bone repair gradually develops from simple fixation and shape repair to reconstruction of multifunctional living tissue. However, fabrication of an intelligent implant with ideal osteogenesis-related functions, similar mechanical and structural characteristics to natural bone is constantly challenging. Herein, we systematically elaborate on the latest research perspectives of smart implants for bone tissue repair and regeneration by referring to hundreds of the latest relevant publications. The latest selection and combination of variable biomaterials, including biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials, are comprehensively discussed for preparing the desirable bone implants. The innovative fabrication strategies for zero-dimensional (0D), 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D implant materials are highlighted in terms of their different styles in clinical application for achieving high-efficiency biocompatibility and osteogenesis-related functions. The stimulation and regulatory effects of the physiochemical characteristics of these intelligent biomaterials on osteogenesis-related functions and bone tissue regeneration are also included and predicted. This review proposes a latest perspective on fabrication strategies of smart implants, aiming to provide innovatively technical and theoretical support for their design and clinical applications in bone tissue repair.
