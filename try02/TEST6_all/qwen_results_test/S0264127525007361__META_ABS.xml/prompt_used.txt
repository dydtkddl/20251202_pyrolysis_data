You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The latest perspective on fabrication strategies of smart implants for bone tissue repair and regeneration Repairing bone tissue by artificial implants is always the most effective strategy to clinically treat bone injuries including in orthopedics and stomatology. To date, the demand for bone repair gradually develops from simple fixation and shape repair to reconstruction of multifunctional living tissue. However, fabrication of an intelligent implant with ideal osteogenesis-related functions, similar mechanical and structural characteristics to natural bone is constantly challenging. Herein, we systematically elaborate on the latest research perspectives of smart implants for bone tissue repair and regeneration by referring to hundreds of the latest relevant publications. The latest selection and combination of variable biomaterials, including biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials, are comprehensively discussed for preparing the desirable bone implants. The innovative fabrication strategies for zero-dimensional (0D), 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D implant materials are highlighted in terms of their different styles in clinical application for achieving high-efficiency biocompatibility and osteogenesis-related functions. The stimulation and regulatory effects of the physiochemical characteristics of these intelligent biomaterials on osteogenesis-related functions and bone tissue regeneration are also included and predicted. This review proposes a latest perspective on fabrication strategies of smart implants, aiming to provide innovatively technical and theoretical support for their design and clinical applications in bone tissue repair.
