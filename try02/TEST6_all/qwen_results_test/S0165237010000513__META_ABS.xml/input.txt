Pyrolysis characteristics of coal and RDF blends in non-isothermal and isothermal conditions Pyrolysis characteristics of the sub-bituminous coal, Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and their blends were determined at non-isothermal (15°C/min) and isothermal (500–800°C) conditions in thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a thermobalance reactor. The decomposition rates of coal and RDF blends are higher than the calculated values of each fuel at the lower temperature ranges (300–385°C). In the isothermal condition, activation energies of coal and RDF blends are lower and the pyrolysis reactivity is higher than the calculated values of each fuel. The synergistic effect exhibits remarkably with the RDF blend ratio of 50% at 700°C. The structural variation and inorganic matters of chars from coal and RDF were determined by using BET, SEM, and XRD techniques. Surface area of the blend char increases and the average pore size decreases with pyrolysis. The addition of RDF into coal produces sulfur fixation of CaS and CaSO3 based on the XRD data.
