On the design of smoldering reactors for out-of-bed heat recovery Smoldering reactors are thermochemical devices that use the energy from solid fuels to propagate a heat wave with the potential to sustain other thermal and thermochemical processes. This experimental study investigates four reactor designs optimized for processing plastic, human feces, and urine. An overall energy balance framework was refined by disaggregating E ̇ loss , distinguishing recoverable from irrecoverable heat losses. The results indicate that 47%–66% of the released energy is recoverable, supporting out-of-bed heat recovery strategies. The conical reactor design demonstrated improved combustion stability by mitigating bed collapse and enhancing vacuum regulation. The bed shrinkage dynamics were analyzed, revealing their impact on combustion front propagation and airflow behavior. In addition, induced airflow dynamics influenced free convection, affecting heat losses and system efficiency. These findings highlight the potential for optimizing smoldering reactor designs to maximize energy recovery and improve sustainability in waste-to-energy applications. The insights presented contribute to the development of scalable and adaptable thermochemical waste treatment systems, facilitating their broader implementation in decentralized sanitation and environmental remediation.
