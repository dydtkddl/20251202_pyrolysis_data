You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in the green synthesis of carbon dots for sustainable development The use of various biomass derivatives and wastes to produce carbon dots (CDs) represents a green synthesis approach that holds great potential for commercialization by offering economically viable, abundant, and sustainable resources. The process is reliable and reproducible by producing high-quality CDs with controllable size and surface structure, high photoluminescence (PL), and narrow emission. This review highlights the potential of biomass wastes and derivatives as a valuable resource for the production of CDs, showcasing their economic viability and environmental sustainability. The discussion is focusing on optimizing the green synthesis of CDs from different biomass precursors, including small molecules (e.g., sugars, polymers, amino acids, proteins, etc.) and biomass wastes (e.g., leaves, stem, root, flower, pollen, etc.), elucidating the underlying synthetic mechanisms, and exploring various modification techniques. The pursuit of high-quality CDs materials is also realized through innovative modification strategies, such as surface passivation, precise morphology and size control, and heteroatom doping, which enable tailoring the properties of CDs according to specific requirements while minimizing waste generation. The formation mechanism and tuning of optical properties were also discussed in detail, focusing on the comparison with CDs using other precursors. We further introduced the sustainable applications of these green CDs on renewable energies, such as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaics. Finally, this review provides a perspective on the challenges, potential advancements and future directions in the field of the green CDs.
