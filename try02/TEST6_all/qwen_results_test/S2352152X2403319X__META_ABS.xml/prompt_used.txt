You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization for energy sector: A current status review The human-induced climate crisis is undoubtedly one of the most unrelenting global challenges we face today. Imperative and immediate policies, initiatives, and actions are vital to tackle the root causes of the problem such as greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen has proven to be a promising clean energy source that may play a vital part in our efforts to combat climate change. This review thoroughly explores the viability of hydrogen energy as a solution and its potential in fighting climate change. While hydrogen energy holds tremendous potential to meet the world's energy needs sustainably, it has its own set of scientific, technological, and applicability challenges that need to be addressed. There exist worldwide collaborative efforts to address issues related to i) production, ii) storage, iii) transmission and distribution, and iv) utilization of hydrogen. The risks associated with hydrogen utilization have been discussed. In this review, authors examine in detail the most recent developments in these categories. The authors emphasize the role of government policies and regulations in the mitigation and adaptation of hydrogen energy. Based on our thorough analysis, green hydrogen technology is expected to dominate hydrogen production not because of its obvious advantages in intrinsic zero carbon potential but because of governments' 2050 net zero commitments that will shape the regulations on how we produce and utilize energy.
