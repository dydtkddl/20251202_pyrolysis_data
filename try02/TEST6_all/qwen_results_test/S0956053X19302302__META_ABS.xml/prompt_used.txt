You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation on liquefaction of plastic waste to oil in supercritical water In order to solve the problem of low thermal conductivity and high viscous molten liquid reaction product in the process of plastic liquefaction, the experiments of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) plastic liquefaction were carried out in supercritical water. In this paper, the effects of different operating conditions (temperature, time, feedstock concentration and pressure) on liquid products were studied. It is found that the novel phenomenon that the liquid products of HIPS plastic were mainly toluene and ethylbenzene rather than styrene, which was a product of polystyrene. The experimental results showed that plastic first depolymerized to form styrene and 1,3-diphenylpropane, which were then converted to toluene and ethylbenzene. The increase in temperature promoted this transformation process and some traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons also produced. At 490 °C, the maximum carbon liquefaction rate of 77.0 wt% was obtained, which was 6 times higher than the conventional pyrolysis, and the content of toluene and ethylbenzene were 14 wt% and 51.3 wt%, respectively. Increasing the reaction pressure and prolonging the reaction time all promoted the progress of the plastic liquefaction reaction, while increasing the feedstock concentration caused the carbon liquefaction rate to increase first and then slightly decrease.
