Recent progress on preparation routes and performance evaluation of ODS/CDS-W alloys for plasma facing materials in fusion devices Tungsten (W) is considered as an ideal candidate matrix metal for plasma-facing materials (PFMs) in a fusion reactor owing to its high melting point and elastic modulus, high thermal conductivity and low vapor pressure, as well as low sputtering yield. However, pure W has low recrystallization temperature (RCT: 1200 ℃) and high ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) which makes its low strength above RCT and poor plasticity at room temperature (RT) of pure W, thereby limiting its practical applications. In this paper, recent research progress in ODS/CDS-W alloys has been reviewed, including fabrication routes (from composite powder preparation to advanced sintering technology and then to mechanical processing) and performance assessments (mechanical properties, thermal shock behavior, hydrogen isotope retention behavior, and resistance to H/He plasma irradiation), which presents the research prospects and development directions of ODS/CDS-W alloys for fusion devices.
