You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar-alginate beads derived from argan nutshells for effective methylene blue removal: A sustainable approach to wastewater treatment This study explores the use of biochar derived from Argan Nutshells as a core component in alginate beads for the removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The characterization of BC/Alg composite was conducted using techniques like Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and size distribution to assess its structural properties and confirm the strong interaction between both components. The adsorbent exhibited surface functional groups characteristic of both biochar and alginate, and SEM confirmed the spherical morphology of the beads. A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the adsorption process by evaluating the effects of key parameters including pH, temperature, adsorbent mass, and dye concentration. The results showed that the BC/Alg effectively removed 96.4 % of MB. The pseudo-second order (PSO) kinetic model best described the MB removal process (R2 = 0.9990), while the Langmuir isotherm model accurately represented the adsorption equilibrium (R2 = 0.96879). After four cycles of regeneration trials, BC/Alg retained 82 % MB removal efficiency, indicating high reusability and stability. The remarkable adsorption capability of BC/Alg showed that it may be employed as an economical and environmentally friendly adsorbent in aqueous solutions, strengthening the case for employing Argan nutshells for water treatment.
