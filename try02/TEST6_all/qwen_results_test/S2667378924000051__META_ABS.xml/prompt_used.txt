You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Properties, production, and modification of polyhydroxyalkanoates Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polymers synthesized by diverse bacteria for carbon and energy storage applications. PHAs are biodegradable and nontoxic. They also exhibit properties similar to those of petroleum-based polymers. Therefore, these materials are promising alternatives to conventional plastics. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of PHA research, from production to application. This review summarizes the thermal and mechanical properties of various PHA homopolymers and copolymers, and compares them with those of common petroleum-based polymers. This comparison indicates that elongation at break is a major weakness of many PHAs. Different organic wastes used in PHA microbial production by mixed culture fermentation are summarized in this review. Important parameters of feedstock fermentation, culture selection, and PHA accumulation were compared. The pH and organic loading rate significantly affected the overall PHA yield, and various feedstocks led to different PHA compositions. Physical (blending and fiber reinforcement) and biological (cofeeding) modifications to improve the mechanical properties of PHA are elaborated in this review. Tensile properties are the major improvements among the mechanical properties after modification. Current applications of PHA and its derivatives are also presented in this work. They are primarily applied in the medicine, agriculture, and packaging industries. The widespread application of PHA faces challenges such as high production costs and limited mechanical properties. This study intends to stimulate further research into cost-effective methods for PHA production and to explore additional modification techniques.
