You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Release of chlorine during oat straw pyrolysis doped with char and ammonium chloride Chlorine is one of the most undesirable elements in agricultural biomass which can cause operating problems during its thermal conversion. Even in low-temperature pyrolysis, chlorine is released in the gaseous phase. Therefore, in order to study the chlorine release during pyrolysis, the following samples were analyzed: oat straw, oat straw doped with char, oat straw doped with NH4Cl, and char doped with NH4Cl. The pyrolysis process of these feedstocks was conducted at 400, 500 and 600 °C under an inert atmosphere, with a short residence time (2 min) for a sample in the reactor. It transpired that the doping of ammonium chloride into oat straw increased the char yield. Doping oat straw with char as well as NH4Cl promoted biochar carbonization. Chlorine release was significantly inhibited when increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 400 to 600 °C for samples of oat straw, oat straw doped with char, and oat straw doped with NH4Cl. In addition, despite the increase in pyrolysis temperature, the percentage of chlorine distributed into the gas phase decreased. Doping oat straw with NH4Cl had a positive effect on increasing the share of furfural (up to 12.9% at 400 °C) in non-condensed gases identified by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
