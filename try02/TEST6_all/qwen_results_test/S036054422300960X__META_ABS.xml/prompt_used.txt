You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of renewable and sustainable aviation biofuels from waste tyres for sustainable aviation transport sector The need for sustainable and renewable alternative fuel sources is increasing day by day since fossil fuel resources are limited and fuel consumption is increasing around the world. The high calorific value of waste tyre makes them an ideal raw material candidate for alternative fuels. Since most of the energy of waste tyres is recycled, the pyrolysis method is a technologically-ready pathway to obtain fuel (oil) from waste tyres. In this article, studies in which oils produced by pyrolysis method from waste tyres were tested as fuel in aviation gas turbine engines were examined. Fuels produced from waste tyre were tested in gas turbine engines, either pure or blended with the base fuel in different proportions. Gas turbine engines were evaluated in terms of combustion, emission, and performance characteristics. The analyzed parameters are static thrust, thrust-specific fuel consumption, turbine inlet temperature, turbine outlet temperature, primary air temperature, thrust-specific emission indexes and emissions (CO, THC, NOx, SO2, and soot), and corrosion rate and hot deposit in the fuel injection line. According to the results examined, the miniature gas turbine engine consumes more fuel when running waste tyre pyrolysis oil. CO and THC emissions of TPO are comparable to jet fuel. While SO2 emissions were less than jet fuel, NOx emissions increased dramatically. The TPO can be used as an alternative fuel in gas turbine engines without major modifications because of its high heating value and combustion characteristics, provided that its properties are improved after the pyrolysis process.
