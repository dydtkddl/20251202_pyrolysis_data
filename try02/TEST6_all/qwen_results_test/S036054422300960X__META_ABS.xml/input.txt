Utilization of renewable and sustainable aviation biofuels from waste tyres for sustainable aviation transport sector The need for sustainable and renewable alternative fuel sources is increasing day by day since fossil fuel resources are limited and fuel consumption is increasing around the world. The high calorific value of waste tyre makes them an ideal raw material candidate for alternative fuels. Since most of the energy of waste tyres is recycled, the pyrolysis method is a technologically-ready pathway to obtain fuel (oil) from waste tyres. In this article, studies in which oils produced by pyrolysis method from waste tyres were tested as fuel in aviation gas turbine engines were examined. Fuels produced from waste tyre were tested in gas turbine engines, either pure or blended with the base fuel in different proportions. Gas turbine engines were evaluated in terms of combustion, emission, and performance characteristics. The analyzed parameters are static thrust, thrust-specific fuel consumption, turbine inlet temperature, turbine outlet temperature, primary air temperature, thrust-specific emission indexes and emissions (CO, THC, NOx, SO2, and soot), and corrosion rate and hot deposit in the fuel injection line. According to the results examined, the miniature gas turbine engine consumes more fuel when running waste tyre pyrolysis oil. CO and THC emissions of TPO are comparable to jet fuel. While SO2 emissions were less than jet fuel, NOx emissions increased dramatically. The TPO can be used as an alternative fuel in gas turbine engines without major modifications because of its high heating value and combustion characteristics, provided that its properties are improved after the pyrolysis process.
