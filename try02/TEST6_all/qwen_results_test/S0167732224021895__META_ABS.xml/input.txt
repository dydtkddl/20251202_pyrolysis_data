Sustainability, safety, biocompatibility and benefits of laser ablated gold, silver and copper nanoparticles: A comprehensive review Pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) technique became versatile for the production of diverse surface functionalized stable and pure organic/inorganic nanostructures including various noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) required for high performance applications in a sustainable way. Strong surface activity of these PLAL grown NMNPs imparts their excellent biocompatibility suitable for in vivo uses, catalysis, optoelectronics, energy generation, biotechnology, medicine, and environmental applications. The PLAL method is very efficient and reproducible for the generation, fragmentation, customization, and conjugation of diverse nanostructures with high purity. Based on these facts, this inclusive review analyzes the current trends, ongoing challenges, and future prospects of PLAL grown various NMNPs needed for sustainable development. Different attributes of these NMNPs such as safety, possible hazard, cost-effectiveness, stability, biocompatibility, basic and applied interests, bioactivity, eco-friendliness, and renewable energy usages are emphasized. In addition, some significant aspects related to the structure and morphology customization of NMNPs obtained using PLAL method are underscored.
