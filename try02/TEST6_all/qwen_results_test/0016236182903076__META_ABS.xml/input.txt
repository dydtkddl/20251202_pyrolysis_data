Investigation of the flash pyrolysis of some coals Five bituminous coals, an anthracite and a lignite have been flash-pyrolysed by the electrically-heated grid technique or by means of an electrically-heated fluidized-bed. In the experiments using a heated grid, data were obtained on rates of rapid devolatilization and on the composition of the gases and tars evolved with heating rates up to 3000 Ks−1 and peak temperatures up to 1400 K. Similar, but more limited data were obtained using the fluidized-bed system. Mathematical models based on overall single- or two-reaction pathways were compared with the experimental results. Good agreement could be achieved by the latter with activation energies of 16 and 35 kJ mol−1.
