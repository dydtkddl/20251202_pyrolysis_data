You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production and characterization of pyrolytic oil by catalytic pyrolysis of Niger seed Conventional pyrolysis of Niger seed was investigated in a semi batch reactor with and without the presence of catalyst. Thermal pyrolysis yielded maximum 34.5% of oil (by weight basis) at 550°C temperature. The catalytic pyrolysis was carried out using catalysts Al2O3, CaO and Kaolin at 2:1, 4:1 and 8:1 feed to catalyst ratio at this temperature. The yield and fuel properties of thermal and catalytic pyrolytic oils were compared. The results confirmed that the presence of catalysts decreased the oil yield marginally whereas enhanced the fuel properties compared with thermal pyrolysis. It was observed that the three catalysts had different effect on the fuel properties of pyrolytic oils. Among the three different feed to catalyst ratios used, 8:1 resulted in higher oil yield and thus the fuel properties were evaluated at this ratio. Kaolin at 8:1 ratio was more suitable to enhance calorific value whereas CaO at 8:1 ratio was able to reduce the viscosity of pyrolytic oil. The FTIR and DSC analysis confirmed that pyrolytic oil was a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds.
