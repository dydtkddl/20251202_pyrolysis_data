You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Blending and emission characteristics of biogasoline produced using CaO/SBA-15 catalyst by cracking used cooking oil The aim of this work is to crack the used cooking oil in a fixed bed cracking unit using impregnated CaO/SBA-15 catalyst to yield liquid hydrocarbons with high % of biogasoline (BioG)fraction. Further, to investigate the capacity of the biogasoline fraction as well as the bio gasoline blends with fossil gasoline in increasing its efficiency. The porous morphology, pore distribution and surface area, elemental composition and phase formation of catalysts were analysed by Scanning electron Microscopy, Surface area analyser and X-ray diffraction techniques. All the synthesized materials were crystalline and least changes were observed with incorporation of CaO on SBA-15. The morphology of the materials were as expected without much agglomeration. SBA-15 exhibited fair surface area of around 1300 m2/g and discrete pores gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Among the catalysts, the composite material, CaO/SBA-15 (4 wt%) efficiently cracked 97% of used cooking oil into 70% liquid products and 69.7% of biogasoline which was confirmed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). BioG showed a good Calorific value of 10000 MJ/Kg which was comparable to that of petroleum fuel. Results of the engine test indicated that using biogasoline–gasoline blended fuels, torque output and fuel consumption of the engine increased when compared to gasoline; CO and SO2 emissions decreased largely due to the oxidation, CO2 emission increased because of the improved combustion and NOX emission from bio gasoline blends was low than gasoline.
