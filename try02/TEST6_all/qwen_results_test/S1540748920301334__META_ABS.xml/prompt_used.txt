You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the calcium carboxylate release behavior during Zhundong coal pyrolysis and combustion In this paper, the dynamic behavior of calcium carboxylate release during Zhundong coal pyrolysis and combustion is studied via reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulation. The molecular structure model of Zhundong coal is constructed based on the combination of the classic Hatcher coal model and experimental characterizations. Pyrolysis simulations on the coal model are performed at different temperatures ranging from 2000 K to 2800 K. The pyrolysis experiments are also carried out to validate the ReaxFF simulation. The results show that most of the calcium are released into the volatiles by the thermal decomposition of CM-Ca (coal/char matrix with calcium bonded) after releasing CO2. The distributions of the calcium bonded to gas, tar and inorganics as well as the atomic calcium in the volatiles are quantitatively classified. The thermal cracking of tar fragments are significant at high temperatures leading to the conversion of calcium from tar into the organic gas. Furthermore, the nascent char model is constructed to study the release behavior of calcium in char combustion stage. The calcium is initially released in the form of oxidized calcium and atomic calcium. With increasing temperature, the oxidized calcium trends to convert to the organically bonded calcium. By using the Arrhenius expression, the kinetic parameters for the release of calcium into various species during pyrolysis and char combustion stages are quantitatively determined.
