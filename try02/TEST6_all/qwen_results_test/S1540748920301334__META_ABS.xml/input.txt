Insight into the calcium carboxylate release behavior during Zhundong coal pyrolysis and combustion In this paper, the dynamic behavior of calcium carboxylate release during Zhundong coal pyrolysis and combustion is studied via reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulation. The molecular structure model of Zhundong coal is constructed based on the combination of the classic Hatcher coal model and experimental characterizations. Pyrolysis simulations on the coal model are performed at different temperatures ranging from 2000 K to 2800 K. The pyrolysis experiments are also carried out to validate the ReaxFF simulation. The results show that most of the calcium are released into the volatiles by the thermal decomposition of CM-Ca (coal/char matrix with calcium bonded) after releasing CO2. The distributions of the calcium bonded to gas, tar and inorganics as well as the atomic calcium in the volatiles are quantitatively classified. The thermal cracking of tar fragments are significant at high temperatures leading to the conversion of calcium from tar into the organic gas. Furthermore, the nascent char model is constructed to study the release behavior of calcium in char combustion stage. The calcium is initially released in the form of oxidized calcium and atomic calcium. With increasing temperature, the oxidized calcium trends to convert to the organically bonded calcium. By using the Arrhenius expression, the kinetic parameters for the release of calcium into various species during pyrolysis and char combustion stages are quantitatively determined.
