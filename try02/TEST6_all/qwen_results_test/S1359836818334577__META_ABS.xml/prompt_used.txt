You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Organophosphorus heteroaromatic compound towards mechanically reinforced and low-flammability epoxy resin In order to solve the contradiction between the flammability and mechanical properties of epoxy resins, a novel organophosphorus heteroaromatic compound (DMBT) was designed and synthesized derived from 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT). In the existence of DMBT, the properties of the resultant epoxy thermosets (EP) were improved obviously in the aspect of flame retardancy and mechanical properties. Benefitting from the design of strong intermolecular action between DMBT and EP, the tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of EP/10 wt% DMBT largely increased to 82.2 ± 4.0 MPa, 122.2 ± 1.7 MPa and 3426 ± 81 MPa from 70.2 ± 5.9, 94.0 ± 2.0 and 2654 ± 139 MPa of EP, respectively. Meanwhile, under the action of DMBT, EP/10 wt% DMBT passed UL-94 V-1 rating and possessed a LOI value of 33.5%. The results of calorimeter tests confirmed that the incorporation of DMBT could effectively reduce the heat release rates (HRR) and total heat release (THR) of materials during combustion. Furthermore, the analysis of the char residue after burning and the volatile products in pyrolysis revealed that the flame-retardant mechanism of DMBT was attributed to improving the charring ability and releasing phosphorus-containing free radicals. This work provides a new strategy to prepare the mechanically-strong and flame-retardant epoxy resins.
