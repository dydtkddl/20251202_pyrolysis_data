You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Innovations in microalgae pyrolysis: Driving circular economy and clean energy goals: Review Microalgae are now considered promising feedstocks to produce renewable biofuels because of their high productivity, quick growth rates, and diverse biochemical makeup, which includes high levels of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. The development of pyrolysis for thermochemical conversion, harvesting, and cultivation is reviewed here, with a focus on process optimisation and co-pyrolysis with complementary feedstocks. Emphasis is placed on recent advancements in catalytic pyrolysis and microwave-assisted pyrolysis, which have demonstrated promise in raising product quality and energy efficiency. The analysis synthesizes research on variables influencing yield and product attributes, as well as technology advancements aimed at improving productivity and sustainability. There is a discussion of both potential and challenges for aligning production systems with the concepts of the circular economy, including energy consumption, feedstock unpredictability, and scale-up constraints. This article presents a comprehensive evaluation of microalgae pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis for biofuel generation, which differs from previous assessments in that it incorporates sustainability concerns, circular economy paths, and new process advances.
