Innovations in microalgae pyrolysis: Driving circular economy and clean energy goals: Review Microalgae are now considered promising feedstocks to produce renewable biofuels because of their high productivity, quick growth rates, and diverse biochemical makeup, which includes high levels of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. The development of pyrolysis for thermochemical conversion, harvesting, and cultivation is reviewed here, with a focus on process optimisation and co-pyrolysis with complementary feedstocks. Emphasis is placed on recent advancements in catalytic pyrolysis and microwave-assisted pyrolysis, which have demonstrated promise in raising product quality and energy efficiency. The analysis synthesizes research on variables influencing yield and product attributes, as well as technology advancements aimed at improving productivity and sustainability. There is a discussion of both potential and challenges for aligning production systems with the concepts of the circular economy, including energy consumption, feedstock unpredictability, and scale-up constraints. This article presents a comprehensive evaluation of microalgae pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis for biofuel generation, which differs from previous assessments in that it incorporates sustainability concerns, circular economy paths, and new process advances.
