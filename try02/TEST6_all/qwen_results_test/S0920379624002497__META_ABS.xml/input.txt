A review of pipe cutting, welding, and NDE technologies for use in fusion devices Piping systems that transport coolant and tritium breeding fluid are naturally an essential part of the support system of nuclear fusion power plants. Following a campaign of operations, the reactor is required to be shut down and maintained. Pipes connected to the reactor components are to be cut, re-welded or re-joined, and inspected using non-destructive methods. This paper outlines the candidate structural materials and their weldability in fusion reactor pipework, reviews welding, cutting, and NDE technologies, and explores tooling prototypes and processes that have been developed for remote pipe maintenance. Finally, a summary of the outstanding and emerging technological challenges resulting from the environmental constraints, material selections, and the requirement of engineering designs is provided, and we highlight opportunities for further research in the future. The urge to develop tools compatible with remote deployment robust to environmental constraints, such as in-pipe robotics with miniaturized end effectors and sensors for operations and inspections under harsh environmental conditions is also addressed.
