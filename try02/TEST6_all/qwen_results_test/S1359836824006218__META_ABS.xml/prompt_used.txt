You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structure-property correlations study in biochar-enhanced polyamide composites for sustainable materials development This study explores the synthesis and characterization of polyamide/biochar composites via in situ polymerization of 12-aminolauric acid with varying biochar concentrations. The motivation behind this research is to enhance the properties of polyamide 12 (PA12) by integrating biochar, a sustainable material derived from biomass, to improve both performance and environmental impact. A detailed structure-property correlation analysis was conducted to assess the effects of biochar on PA12's morphology, mechanical behavior, crystallinity, thermal stability, viscoelastic performance, and environmental sustainability. Key findings include successful PA12 synthesis, confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Increased biochar content led to a decrease in molecular weight and an increase in crystallinity from 27 % to 38 %, suggesting enhanced nucleation effects. SEM analysis showed excellent dispersion and compatibility of biochar within the PA12 matrix, leading to significant improvements in tensile strength (from 38 ± 1 MPa to 54 ± 2 MPa) and modulus (from 745 ± 30 MPa to 2055 ± 65 MPa). Rheological tests demonstrated shear-thinning behavior, facilitating effective extrusion-based 3D printing of a complex object with 50 wt% biochar. A life cycle assessment revealed substantial environmental benefits, including a net reduction of 1.83 kg·CO₂ equiv.·kg⁻1 due to the use of biochar derived from wood pyrolysis. These findings highlight the potential of PA12/biochar composites as environmentally sustainable structural materials, combining enhanced functional properties with significant ecological advantages.
