Structure-property correlations study in biochar-enhanced polyamide composites for sustainable materials development This study explores the synthesis and characterization of polyamide/biochar composites via in situ polymerization of 12-aminolauric acid with varying biochar concentrations. The motivation behind this research is to enhance the properties of polyamide 12 (PA12) by integrating biochar, a sustainable material derived from biomass, to improve both performance and environmental impact. A detailed structure-property correlation analysis was conducted to assess the effects of biochar on PA12's morphology, mechanical behavior, crystallinity, thermal stability, viscoelastic performance, and environmental sustainability. Key findings include successful PA12 synthesis, confirmed by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Increased biochar content led to a decrease in molecular weight and an increase in crystallinity from 27 % to 38 %, suggesting enhanced nucleation effects. SEM analysis showed excellent dispersion and compatibility of biochar within the PA12 matrix, leading to significant improvements in tensile strength (from 38 ± 1 MPa to 54 ± 2 MPa) and modulus (from 745 ± 30 MPa to 2055 ± 65 MPa). Rheological tests demonstrated shear-thinning behavior, facilitating effective extrusion-based 3D printing of a complex object with 50 wt% biochar. A life cycle assessment revealed substantial environmental benefits, including a net reduction of 1.83 kg·CO₂ equiv.·kg⁻1 due to the use of biochar derived from wood pyrolysis. These findings highlight the potential of PA12/biochar composites as environmentally sustainable structural materials, combining enhanced functional properties with significant ecological advantages.
