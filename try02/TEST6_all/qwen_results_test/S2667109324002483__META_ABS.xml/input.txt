The role of size and structure of catalytic active sites in polyolefin hydrogenolysis The increasing amount of plastic waste poses serious environmental problems that threaten both ecosystems and human well-being. Hydrogenolysis has been widely studied as an effective approach for converting polyolefins into high-value liquids and waxy fuels. Their multifaceted reaction mechanism, including dehydrogenation, C–C bond cleavage, and hydrogenation, highlights the need for sophisticated catalyst design. The suppression of methane production, a persistent challenge in polyolefin hydrogenolysis, requires precise control of the cleavage site and inhibition of successive C–C bond cleavage. This delicate balance is achieved by carefully tuning the size and structure of metals. In this review, we investigate the effects of the size and structure of active sites on their catalytic activity and selectivity for the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins, including polyethylene and polypropylene. A fundamental understanding of hydrogenolysis mechanisms, combined with strategic synthetic methodologies, is crucial for creating efficient catalysts with tailored properties.
