You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Operando FTIR-ATR with molecular dynamic simulations to understand the diffusion mechanism of waste tire-derived pyrolytic oil for asphalt self-healing Recent research proves that pyrolytic oils from waste tires are effective in restoring the chemical and rheological properties of aged asphalt binders. Nonetheless, the role of oil-binder molecular interactions and bindeŕs aging degree on the diffusional behavior of the pyro-oils is still unclear. In this study, authors propose integrating operando Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a novel approach to unravel the diffusion mechanisms of pyro-oils in asphalt binders with self-healing purposes. The produced pyro-oils contains aliphatic and single-ring alkyl aromatic compounds as the most abundant species (ca. 80%). The operando FTIR measurements were correlated by a Fickian model, resulting in diffusion coefficients (D0) between 10-12 and 10-11 m2s−1. Moreover, MD simulations, with a molecular model of aged asphalt containing benzylic rings, sulfoxides, and hydroxyl functional groups, demonstrated that interactions of functional groups in the pyro-oil with the binder, hinder the diffusion behavior of the pyro-oil. The D0 estimated from the MD simulations agreed with those calculated from experimental data and previous reports for petro- and bio-derived rejuvenators. The predictive performance of the MD simulations developed in this study confirms to design of more resilient self-healing asphalt binders using a bottom-up strategy.
