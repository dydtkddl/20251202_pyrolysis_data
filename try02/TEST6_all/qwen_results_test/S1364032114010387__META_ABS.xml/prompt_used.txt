You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Membrane processes and renewable energies In this work, an overview of the interconnections between membrane technology and renewable energy sources (biomass, salinity gradient power, wind, solar) is given. Regarding biomass, membrane processes such as membrane reactors and bio-reactors, membrane contactors, membrane distillation in the logic of process intensification strategy may be opportunely integrated in the production processes of green fuels. Their advantages such as reduction of the separation load and stage number, improved yields and selectivities compared to conventional processes imply low direct energy consumption, lower footprint area occupied by the processes plants. Moreover, the possibility of integration these advanced membrane processes with other traditional membrane operations such as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), pervaporation (PV) allows the reduction of indirect energy consumption through the recycling and reuse of raw materials and secondary materials minimizing the formation of wastes. Both Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) and Reversed Electro Dialysis (RED), the only two technologies for which salinity gradient power-based demonstration projects are running, use membranes. In this article, key points and challenges to be faced for both PRO and RED are reported. On the other side, membrane desalination plants, are more often considered excellent locations to install wind and solar power generators. Most advanced research in the field is focused on solar assisted membrane distillation (MD). In the logic of fully "sustainable desalination", highly innovative technologies such as Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) could be integrated as pre-treatment stage in membrane desalination plants in remote, arid regions.
