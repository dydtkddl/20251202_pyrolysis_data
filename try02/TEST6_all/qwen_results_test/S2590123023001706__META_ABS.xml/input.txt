Algal biochar of unique structure as a robust alternative to manipulate mixed-matrix membranes performance and fouling resistance A new application has been introduced for Cladophora glomerata, the most abundant and one of the most harmful filamentous algae widely distributed in fresh waters. Biochar of unique filter-like structure was synthesized through the pyrolysis of C. glomerata and after being fully characterized, was incorporated for the first time in the structure of mixed matrix membranes to manipulate the dominant characteristics of the membranes. At different amounts, the biochar was incorporated in polyethersulfone to prepare the novel biochar-amended mixed matrix membranes. The permeate water flux, antifouling, flux recovery ratio, and the salt and dye rejections were assessed for the bare and biochar-amended membranes to verify the effect of biochar on membrane performance. It has been shown that, the higher the amount of biochar, the lower the contact angle and the more the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The mean pore radius and porosity of the modified membranes were significantly increased compared to that of the bare PES membrane, and consequently, pure water fluxes were increased by more than 63% in biochar-amended membranes. Based on the obtained results, 0.5 wt% was determined as the optimum amount of biochar leading to the best biochar-amended mix matrix membrane performance.
