Impervious and influence in the liquid fuel production from municipal plastic waste through thermo-chemical biomass conversion technologies - A review Plastic waste is an environmental burden substance, which poses a high threat to the society during disposal. Rather than disposal, recycling of this waste to liquid fuel gains importance owing to its high utility. Among various techniques, thermo-chemical recycling techniques hold more benefits in generating high value added liquid fuels. In this review, the details of municipal plastic waste generation are provided with a brief description of the plastic waste management option and importance of recycling is explained. The overview of the thermo-chemical treatment focusing on the pyrolysis, gasification and hydrocracking process was elaborated. Catalysts mediated pyrolysis have wide-open their prospective for the generation of bio-oil, hydrocarbons, syngas and deterioration of undesired substances. Generally, advance development of enthusiastic catalysts for the synthesis of bio-oil would be vital for scaling up the pyrolysis process to succeed in commercial manufacture of biofuels from waste plastics. Overall rate treatment depends on operating parameter which determines the process efficiency and product yield. Hence, critical assessment of various parameter that has remarkable effect in the thermo-chemical treatment process was documented in detail. Moreover, endorsements of liquid fuel production, economic viability, and energy requirement of the treatment process, were delivered to attain effectual plastic wastes management.
