You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Wall collision-induced fragmentation of coal particles in rapid pyrolysis: Effects of coal rank and impact angle During rapid pyrolysis, the fragmentation effect induced by the collision of coal particles with walls is a key factor promoting the formation of fine particulate matter in tar. This study employed an integrated approach combining high-speed visualization systems and digital image processing techniques to systematically analyze the fragmentation characteristics of six coal particles of different ranks during interactions with walls at various impact angles. The results demonstrate a significant negative correlation between coal rank and particle fragmentation propensity. Among the coal types studied, Zhaotong (ZT) coal, a representative low-rank coal, displayed pronounced fragmentation behavior due to the rapid release of volatiles during pyrolysis, forming an easily fractured porous and fragile char matrix. Notably, compared to the high breakage ratio of 6.5 % observed during normal (0°) impact, the fragmentation probability of coal particles colliding with inclined walls significantly decreased (e.g., reduced to 4.3 % at 30° and further to 0.3 % at 75°). This fragmentation probability exhibited a clear decreasing trend with increasing impact angle. The collision behavior was further quantified by analyzing key parameters including the coefficient of restitution, impact angle, incident velocity, and rebound velocity. This systematic investigation provides important theoretical insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing coal particle behavior under fast pyrolysis conditions.
