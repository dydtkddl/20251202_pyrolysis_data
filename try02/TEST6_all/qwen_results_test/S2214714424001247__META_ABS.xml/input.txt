Ball milling enhances pyrolytic remediation of petroleum-contaminated soil and reuse as adsorptive/catalytic materials for wastewater treatment Petroleum-contaminated soil (PCS) requires an integrated treatment strategy for the simultaneous cleanup of pollutants and beneficial reuse of post-remediation soil. A combined process of ball milling and pyrolysis was used to treat PCS. The obtained carbonized soil (BRCS) was used to adsorb heavy metals and activate persulfate (PS) oxidation. The maximum adsorption capacity of BRCS for Pb2+ reaches 983.7 mg/g. When the BRCS and PS dosage is 3 g/L and 2 g/L, respectively, the removal rate of aniline (100 mg/L) is close to 100 %. Ball milling pretreatment significantly improves the heavy metal adsorption property and persulfate activation performance of the pyrolytic carbonized soil. According to sequential extraction, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, ball milling pretreatment considerably increases the adsorption capacities of carbonized soil for heavy metals by enhancing carbonate binding and Fe/Mn oxide complexation/coprecipitation. Quenching experiments show that the nonradical path dominates the persulfate oxidation process. Electron paramagnetic resonance and linear sweep voltammetry analyses show that ball milling pretreatment produces more surface-bound semiquinone radical, which greatly activates persulfate oxidation by accelerating direct electron transfer. This study proposes an integrated resource utilization strategy for carbonized soil by stimulation of endogenous functional components in carbonized soil and beneficial reuse of hazardous environmental permanent free radicals.
