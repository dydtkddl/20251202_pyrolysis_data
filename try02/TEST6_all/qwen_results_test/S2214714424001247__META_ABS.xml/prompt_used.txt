You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ball milling enhances pyrolytic remediation of petroleum-contaminated soil and reuse as adsorptive/catalytic materials for wastewater treatment Petroleum-contaminated soil (PCS) requires an integrated treatment strategy for the simultaneous cleanup of pollutants and beneficial reuse of post-remediation soil. A combined process of ball milling and pyrolysis was used to treat PCS. The obtained carbonized soil (BRCS) was used to adsorb heavy metals and activate persulfate (PS) oxidation. The maximum adsorption capacity of BRCS for Pb2+ reaches 983.7 mg/g. When the BRCS and PS dosage is 3 g/L and 2 g/L, respectively, the removal rate of aniline (100 mg/L) is close to 100 %. Ball milling pretreatment significantly improves the heavy metal adsorption property and persulfate activation performance of the pyrolytic carbonized soil. According to sequential extraction, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, ball milling pretreatment considerably increases the adsorption capacities of carbonized soil for heavy metals by enhancing carbonate binding and Fe/Mn oxide complexation/coprecipitation. Quenching experiments show that the nonradical path dominates the persulfate oxidation process. Electron paramagnetic resonance and linear sweep voltammetry analyses show that ball milling pretreatment produces more surface-bound semiquinone radical, which greatly activates persulfate oxidation by accelerating direct electron transfer. This study proposes an integrated resource utilization strategy for carbonized soil by stimulation of endogenous functional components in carbonized soil and beneficial reuse of hazardous environmental permanent free radicals.
