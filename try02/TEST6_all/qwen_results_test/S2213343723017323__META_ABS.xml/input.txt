Toward a circular economy: Investigating the effectiveness of different plastic waste management strategies: A comprehensive review Plastic waste has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. It is estimated that over 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans each year, threatening marine life and habitats. Additionally, plastic waste has been linked to adverse health effects in humans, making it a problem that requires urgent attention. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the plastic waste problem, including its spread and impact on the environment. The latest research on plastic waste management strategies, covering mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological approaches was investigated. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of each technique, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to the problem, were highlighted. As an alternative to traditional plastics, the potential of bioplastics, which are derived from renewable resources and can be biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable was reviewed. The availability of bioplastics in the market, their physical properties, and their potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation were monitored. Overall, this article underscores the urgent need for effective plastic waste management strategies that integrate multiple approaches. It emphasizes the importance of adopting a circular economy model that prioritizes waste reduction, reuse, and recycling, while also exploring alternative materials such as bioplastics. The article concludes with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for addressing the plastic waste problem and a call for collective action toward a more sustainable future.
