You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Toward a circular economy: Investigating the effectiveness of different plastic waste management strategies: A comprehensive review Plastic waste has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. It is estimated that over 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans each year, threatening marine life and habitats. Additionally, plastic waste has been linked to adverse health effects in humans, making it a problem that requires urgent attention. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the plastic waste problem, including its spread and impact on the environment. The latest research on plastic waste management strategies, covering mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological approaches was investigated. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of each technique, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to the problem, were highlighted. As an alternative to traditional plastics, the potential of bioplastics, which are derived from renewable resources and can be biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable was reviewed. The availability of bioplastics in the market, their physical properties, and their potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation were monitored. Overall, this article underscores the urgent need for effective plastic waste management strategies that integrate multiple approaches. It emphasizes the importance of adopting a circular economy model that prioritizes waste reduction, reuse, and recycling, while also exploring alternative materials such as bioplastics. The article concludes with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for addressing the plastic waste problem and a call for collective action toward a more sustainable future.
