Catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by hierarchical catalysts prepared using zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement A hierarchical structure with mesopores was developed around zeolite crystals by zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement (ZDGSR) method where a reinforcing agent composed of hexamethyldisiloxane and acetic anhydride was reacted with HY-zeolite crystals directly. The effects of changing the hydrothermal condition on the development of hierarchical structure of catalysts were examined. In addition, a catalytic cracking of LDPE using the hierarchical catalysts was evaluated by the Curie point pyrolyzer (CPP) method. The micropore surface area in the t-plot method decreased and the external surface area increased with increasing temperature and the elapse of time in the treatment with a reinforcing agent. The result confirmed the development of mesopores derived from zeolite crystals as SiO2 source. In catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by the CPP method using the prepared catalysts, the conversions were similar to or slightly lower than that of the parent Y-zeolite catalyst. When the relative activity, which represents the activity per the amounts of zeolite crystals and acid sites, was estimated using the conversion of LDPE, XRD signal intensity and NH3-TPD value, the linear relationship was observed between the relative activity and the average pore diameter calculated from BET surface area and total pore volume. The result suggested that the pore size of a catalyst could be one of the most important factors to control the intrinsic activity of zeolite in catalytic cracking of LDPE.
