You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by hierarchical catalysts prepared using zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement A hierarchical structure with mesopores was developed around zeolite crystals by zeolite-dissolving gel skeletal reinforcement (ZDGSR) method where a reinforcing agent composed of hexamethyldisiloxane and acetic anhydride was reacted with HY-zeolite crystals directly. The effects of changing the hydrothermal condition on the development of hierarchical structure of catalysts were examined. In addition, a catalytic cracking of LDPE using the hierarchical catalysts was evaluated by the Curie point pyrolyzer (CPP) method. The micropore surface area in the t-plot method decreased and the external surface area increased with increasing temperature and the elapse of time in the treatment with a reinforcing agent. The result confirmed the development of mesopores derived from zeolite crystals as SiO2 source. In catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene by the CPP method using the prepared catalysts, the conversions were similar to or slightly lower than that of the parent Y-zeolite catalyst. When the relative activity, which represents the activity per the amounts of zeolite crystals and acid sites, was estimated using the conversion of LDPE, XRD signal intensity and NH3-TPD value, the linear relationship was observed between the relative activity and the average pore diameter calculated from BET surface area and total pore volume. The result suggested that the pore size of a catalyst could be one of the most important factors to control the intrinsic activity of zeolite in catalytic cracking of LDPE.
