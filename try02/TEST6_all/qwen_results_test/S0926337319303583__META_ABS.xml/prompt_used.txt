You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reactive sites rich porous tubular yolk-shell g-C3N4 via precursor recrystallization mediated microstructure engineering for photoreduction Photoabsorption, charge separation efficiency and surface reactive catalytic sites are three critical factors in semiconductor photocatalytic process, which determine the photocatalytic activity. For bulk g-C3N4 derived from direct pyrolysis of C/N rich precursors, reactive sites distributed on the lateral edges are very scarce. In this work, we report the template-free preparation of three novel structured g-C3N4, namely, porous tubular (PT) g-C3N4, porous tubular yolk-shell (PTYS) g-C3N4, and porous split yolk-shell (PSYS) g-C3N4, by an unprecedented precursor microstructure regulation of melamine crystals in a gas-pressure mediated re-crystallization process. Enhanced photoabsorption, increased surface area, largely improved separation and migration efficiencies of photoinduced charge carriers are simultaneously realized in these g-C3N4 structures. Noticeably, selective photo-deposition test uncovers that the porous outer-walls and inner-rods of PTYS g-C3N4 are enriched by abundant reductive reactive sites, which consumedly boost the photo-reduction activity. Collectively promoted by these advantages, PTYS g-C3N4 shows not only an efficient H2 production activity with a high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 11.8% at λ = 420 ± 15 nm, but also a superior CO2 reduction for CO production than bulk g-C3N4 by a factor 5.6, which is verified by the 13C isotopic labeling. This work develops precursor microstructure engineering as a promising strategy for rational design of unordinary g-C3N4 structure for renewable energy production.
