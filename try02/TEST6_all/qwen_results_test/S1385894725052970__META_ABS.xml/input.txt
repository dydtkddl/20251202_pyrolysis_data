Preferable and feasible tests on phosphorus release/recovery from anaerobically digested bacterial and algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludges This study underscores the role of waste sludge in sustainable wastewater management and resource recovery by comparing the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion (AD) as pretreatment to release phosphorus (P) from bacterial and algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge (AGS). The AD performance, degradation of proteins (PN) and polysaccharides (PS) in both types of granules and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), P release in both digestates and stratified EPS from both AGS were compared by 30-day batch biomethane potential tests. Results show that bacterial AGS is desirable for P enrichment, release, and recovery, demonstrating higher biodegradability (54 %), PN degradation (64 %), and greater EPS-based P recovery potential. While algal-bacterial AGS exhibits similar cumulative methane production (193 mL/g-VSadded), it outperforms in PS degradation (87 %), methane content, and theoretical maximum methane production value. Distinctions in granular structure, microbial metabolic activity, and substrate degradability primarily differentiate carbon fate, methane production pathways, and P release. Notably, the microbial synergy in algal-bacterial AGS has yet to be fully exploited, presenting substantial potential for further optimization. Additionally, preliminary analysis of the precipitates generated from the P-rich digestate evidences its potential for P recovery. These findings can provide valuable insights into sustainable waste-to-resource conversion for excess AGS.
