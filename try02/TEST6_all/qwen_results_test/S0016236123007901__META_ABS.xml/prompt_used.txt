You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with other carbonaceous materials: A review on advance technologies, synergistic effect, and future prospectus Due to the continuous rise in population, modernization, and industrialization, the demand for energy is increasing day by day, resulting in serious issues such as fossil fuel depletion, pollution, and power shortages. As a result, there is an urgent need to investigate alternate energy sources. Lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis has been shown as the most promising feedstock for the production of sustainable and renewable biofuels. Unfortunately, the fuel characteristics of bio-oil generated from biomass pyrolysis are still insufficient to meet petroleum products ASTM standards. To address these challenges, co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with other carbonaceous materials (e.g., plastic waste, Tyre garbage etc.) is emerging as one of the most promising approaches. Various experimental studied have been conducted on lignocellulosic biomasses co-pyrolysis with other carbonaceous materials such as plastic waste, tire waste, coal, algae and sewage sludge. The present manuscript aims to review and establish the scope of co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with various carbon rich feedstocks for renewable production of high-quality renewable fuels. The synergistic effect between lignocellulosic biomass and other carbonaceous materials has been explored in detail. Furthermore, recent advances in co-pyrolysis process along with the reaction affecting parameters are also summarized in brief. Consequently, this review demonstrates both highlights of the remarkable achievement of co-pyrolysis and the milestones that are necessary to be garnered in the future.
