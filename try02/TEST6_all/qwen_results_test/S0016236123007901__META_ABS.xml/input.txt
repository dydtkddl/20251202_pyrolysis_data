Co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with other carbonaceous materials: A review on advance technologies, synergistic effect, and future prospectus Due to the continuous rise in population, modernization, and industrialization, the demand for energy is increasing day by day, resulting in serious issues such as fossil fuel depletion, pollution, and power shortages. As a result, there is an urgent need to investigate alternate energy sources. Lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis has been shown as the most promising feedstock for the production of sustainable and renewable biofuels. Unfortunately, the fuel characteristics of bio-oil generated from biomass pyrolysis are still insufficient to meet petroleum products ASTM standards. To address these challenges, co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with other carbonaceous materials (e.g., plastic waste, Tyre garbage etc.) is emerging as one of the most promising approaches. Various experimental studied have been conducted on lignocellulosic biomasses co-pyrolysis with other carbonaceous materials such as plastic waste, tire waste, coal, algae and sewage sludge. The present manuscript aims to review and establish the scope of co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with various carbon rich feedstocks for renewable production of high-quality renewable fuels. The synergistic effect between lignocellulosic biomass and other carbonaceous materials has been explored in detail. Furthermore, recent advances in co-pyrolysis process along with the reaction affecting parameters are also summarized in brief. Consequently, this review demonstrates both highlights of the remarkable achievement of co-pyrolysis and the milestones that are necessary to be garnered in the future.
