Hydrogen production, storage, and CI Engine utilisation: A global perspective Rise in population and industrialisation has significantly impacted the fossil fuel reserves at global scale which has given rise to alarming emission levels in the environment. To address these issues, hydrogen is a favourable alternative owing to its high calorific value, high flame speeds, shorter flame quenching distance and clean burning nature. The present review provides a comprehensive coverage of different hydrogen production methods, hydrogen storage techniques and application of hydrogen in CI engines. Comparative assessment studies illustrated that thermal based hydrogen production methods have higher environmental impact than all other methods but are commercially mature, cost competitive than other hydrogen production routes. Storage techniques of hydrogen includes compression, liquification, cryo-compression, physical and chemical based storage methods. Compression based technology for hydrogen storage offers the advantages of being commercially mature, faster filling and release compared to other technologies offering higher volumetric and gravimetric density than compression-based methods at impractical operating conditions. CI engine studies of hydrogen as dual fuel suggested better performance attributes (high BTE and lower BSFC), lower emissions (such as CO, CO2, HC, smoke with slight increment in NOx emissions) and improved combustion (high HRR, in-cylinder temperature & pressure) owing to high flame speed, wider flammability limits, small quenching zone and high diffusivity of hydrogen.
