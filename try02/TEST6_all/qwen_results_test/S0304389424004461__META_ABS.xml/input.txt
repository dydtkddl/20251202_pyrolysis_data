Comparative study by microwave pyrolysis and conventional pyrolysis of pharmaceutical sludge: Resourceful disposal and antibiotic adsorption Compared with conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis has superior heat transfer performance and promotes the decomposition of organic matter. The paper focuses on the harmless treatment and resource utilization of pharmaceutical sludge (PS) by microwave heating and conventional heating methods. The experimental results showed that the conventional pyrolysis gas is dominated by CO2, CO and H2. For microwave pyrolysis gas, the “microwave effect” promoted secondary cracking of volatile fractions and increases the content of CH4, CxHy, H2 and CO through condensation, aromatization, and dehydrogenation. Conventional pyrolysis oils contained the highest percentage of oxygenated compounds. However, high-temperature microwave radiation accelerated the cleavage of polar oxygenated molecular bonds and long-chain hydrocarbons, thereby increasing the aromatics content of pyrolysis oils. The solid residues obtained from microwave pyrolysis is highly graphitized and porous, with a surface area of 146.2 m2/g. Furthermore, the solid residue was rich in pyridine-N and pyrrole-N that could be utilized for adsorption and catalysis. The MA-600 removes up to 99% of tetracycline (TC) in 6 h. It was also found that the adsorption process of TC by the two pyrolysis residues was consistent with the proposed secondary and Freundlich models.
