You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene for liquid fuel production using a reactor integrated with a fractionation column The increasing accumulation of plastic waste, particularly from polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE), necessitates effective valorisation strategies. This study investigates the potential of non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis for converting these plastics into liquid fuel using a reactor integrated with a fractionation column. The effect of temperature (350–650 °C) and the presence of an HZSM-5 catalyst on fuel yield and quality was examined to optimize the pyrolysis process. The results indicate that higher temperatures and catalytic pyrolysis significantly enhance the production of lighter hydrocarbon fractions. Among the tested plastics, PS exhibited the highest calorific value, followed by PP and PE. The introduction of HZSM-5 catalyst notably increased API gravity, signifying the formation of lighter, fuel-grade hydrocarbons. The liquid products displayed varying colours and compositions across different fractionation trays, with fractions ranging from brownish yellow to pitch-black, indicating differences in carbon content. The heaviest fractions, accumulating in Tray IV, primarily consisted of high-carbon-content hydrocarbons and solid black tar. GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of C1–C13 aromatic compounds, essential components of fuel oil. These findings highlight the potential of optimized catalytic pyrolysis in transforming plastic waste into valuable liquid fuels that closely align with commercial fuel standards. Furthermore, an economic feasibility assessment suggests promising prospects for the large-scale implementation of this pyrolysis technology.
