Analytical pyrolysis of humic substances and soils: geochemical, agricultural and ecological consequences This review summarizes recent applications of analytical pyrolysis in the following areas: Geochemistry Advances in the methodology of Curie-point pyrolysis—gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry and pyrolysis—field ionization mass spectrometry for structural studies of humic fractions and organic matter in whole soils are reported, and a macromolecular concept for the backbone structure of humic substances is proposed. Agriculture Studies on the formation of soil organic matter, long-term fertilization experiments, and improved soil management are described. An analytical strategy for solving the problem of unidentified organic nitrogen-containing compounds in agricultural soils is outlined. Ecology The potential and limitations of analytical pyrolysis for direct, integrated studies of soil organic matter in agricultural and forest soils and dissolved organic matter in water are discussed. Future research goals to monitor systematically the trends in soil quality are delineated.
