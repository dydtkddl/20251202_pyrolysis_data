You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chem-biotech strategy to synthesize sustainable urethane-based polymers and additives from microbially produced hydroxyalkanoyloxy-alkanoates and polyol lipids Combining biotechnology and chemistry strategies seems to be one of the main drivers to develop innovative and sustainable macromolecular architectures for the next decades, starting from renewable carbon sources, such as biomass and plastic wastes. Herein, microbially produced biobased precursors, namely esterified 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoates (HAAs), averagely comprised of ten carbons each fatty acid, and polyol lipids (PL) mainly structured with 3,5-dihydroxydecanoic acids connected to a mannitol head group as the largest fraction (78 %), have been used as building blocks to synthesize different urethane-based polymers and plasticizers as a proof of concept of this global approach. Polyurethanes (PU) were elaborated using HAAs and PL as chain extenders and then processed as films. The structure of these polyester-polyols significantly impacted the resulting properties. The hard segments (HS) on HAA-based PUs slightly increases from 40 to 46 % and the asymmetrical disposal of aliphatic chains hindered regular organization, making all samples fully amorphous. Conversely, the chain’s entanglement benefited network cohesion. In contrast, chemically crosslinked PL-based PU can be processed as films with superior mechanical properties, despite having lower HS (33 %). Additionally, plasticizers based on HAAs, and PL significantly increased the flexibility and elasticity of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These findings suggest that such sustainable polyester-polyols offer valuable potential for developing sustainable PUs, meeting the requirements of a circular (bio)economy.
