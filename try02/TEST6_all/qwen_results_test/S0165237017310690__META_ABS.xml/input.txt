Sugarcane bagasse ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis for the production of Benzene, Toluene and Xylenes (BTX) The ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse with various HZSM-5 (23, 50, and 80) catalysts was studied in a tandem micro reactor-GC/MS at 400 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C and 550 °C with a catalyst to biomass (C/B) ratios ranging from 2 to 23. The yields of benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) were significantly affected by pyrolysis temperature and C/B ratio. The highest BTX yield of 22% was obtained for the HZSM-5 (23) catalyst at C/B ratio of 12.5 and a temperature of 475 °C. Finally, an experimental design was performed to determine the optimal process conditions for BTX yields.
