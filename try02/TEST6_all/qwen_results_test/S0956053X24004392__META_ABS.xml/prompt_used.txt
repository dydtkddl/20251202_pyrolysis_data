You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of high quality carbon nanotubes by catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics using FeNi-based catalyst Plastic waste pollution is the serious environmental problem, and catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics is an effective way to solve this problem. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are prepared by catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste plastics by one-stage method using iron nitrate and nickel nitrate as catalyst. The growth mechanism of CNTs is analyzed in detail. TPO, XRD, SEM and Raman analyses show that increasing Ni content contributes to the production of CNTs with good morphology and high graphitization degree. While the increasing Fe content contributes to improving the yield of CNTs. The outer and inner diameters of the FeNi12-CNTs-800 are about 21 nm and 8 nm with the length of 18.9 μm, respectively. LDPE pyrolysis gases are analyzed to determine that the primary carbon source required for CNTs growth is C2H4. The C2H4 adsorption and decomposition processes on FeNi alloys are performed to reveal the growth mechanism of CNTs, based on density functional theory calculation. Three kinds of the growth models are proposed to explain the difference of the CNTs tubular shape. FeNi12-CNTs-800 are used to remove microplastics from wastewater due to existence of magnetic. PVC can be quickly removed from wastewater with removal of 100 % at 20 min. This study provides an effective way for recycling and treatment of waste plastic.
