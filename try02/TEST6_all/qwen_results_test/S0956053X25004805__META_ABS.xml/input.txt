Sewage sludge char catalyzed steam reforming of volatiles from MSW pyrolysis for H2-rich syngas production: Influence of char properties This study employed a pyrolysis-steam reforming reaction system to produce H2-rich syngas from municipal solid waste (MSW) with sewage sludge chars (SSCs) as catalysts. To determine the most important SSC properties influencing H2 yield, catalytic performances of 7 different plain SSCs were compared to choose the proper SSC as catalyst. The pyrolysis of MSW and steam reforming of the volatiles were carried out at 550 and 800 °C respectively, and H2 production from different MSW components were also checked. It has been found that the fixed carbon (FC) content of SSCs is the most important factor influencing H2 yield, followed by Fe content and specific area. An FC-Fe-S index was defined to correlate SSC properties with H2 yield, which exhibits a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.96). Additionally, it has been found the plastics in MSW produce the most long-chain aliphatic volatile compounds during pyrolysis process and result in the highest H2 yield of 1.54 Nm3/kgwaste in the reforming stage; while biomass components correspond to lower H2 yields ranging from 0.71 to 0.84 Nm3/kgwaste due to their higher oxygen contents. This research provides valuable insights for choosing cheap SSCs as sacrificial catalyst to enhance H2 production through MSW pyrolysis-steam reforming technology.
