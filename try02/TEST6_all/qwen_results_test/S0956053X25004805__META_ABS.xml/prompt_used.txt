You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sewage sludge char catalyzed steam reforming of volatiles from MSW pyrolysis for H2-rich syngas production: Influence of char properties This study employed a pyrolysis-steam reforming reaction system to produce H2-rich syngas from municipal solid waste (MSW) with sewage sludge chars (SSCs) as catalysts. To determine the most important SSC properties influencing H2 yield, catalytic performances of 7 different plain SSCs were compared to choose the proper SSC as catalyst. The pyrolysis of MSW and steam reforming of the volatiles were carried out at 550 and 800 °C respectively, and H2 production from different MSW components were also checked. It has been found that the fixed carbon (FC) content of SSCs is the most important factor influencing H2 yield, followed by Fe content and specific area. An FC-Fe-S index was defined to correlate SSC properties with H2 yield, which exhibits a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.96). Additionally, it has been found the plastics in MSW produce the most long-chain aliphatic volatile compounds during pyrolysis process and result in the highest H2 yield of 1.54 Nm3/kgwaste in the reforming stage; while biomass components correspond to lower H2 yields ranging from 0.71 to 0.84 Nm3/kgwaste due to their higher oxygen contents. This research provides valuable insights for choosing cheap SSCs as sacrificial catalyst to enhance H2 production through MSW pyrolysis-steam reforming technology.
