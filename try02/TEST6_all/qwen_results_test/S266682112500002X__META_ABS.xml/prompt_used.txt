You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Renewable syngas production from electrified catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis volatiles Pyrolysis of biomass plus catalytic reforming of its pyrolysis volatiles is a green alternative to produce solid (biochar) and gaseous (syngas) fuels that have several valuable applications; however, this catalytic process suffers from fast deactivation, and its energy consumption is yet to be studied, factors that determine the process’s feasibility in industrialisation. To address these issues, the direct electrification of a 3D-printed FeCrAl heater coated with 15.5 % Ni/Al 2 O 3 was tested in a parametric study in the catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis volatiles, in order to investigate the effect of the S/B ratio and space–time on the syngas yield and composition. Complete bio-oil reforming was obtained at a biomass feed rate of ≤ 1 g min−1 and a S/B ratio of ≥ 2, and stability close to 100 % was estimated after over four hours of operation. Nonetheless, the produced syngas is rich in C 1 – C 3 gases and moderately low in H 2 ( ≈ 2 wt %). The effect of the catalyst’s structure on the bio-oil reforming and heat efficiency was complemented using CFD simulations and compared to a simple geometry based on commercial extruded monoliths. Finally, the biomass-derived syngas upgrading to H 2 production was assessed using different process simulations and compared to existing H 2 -producing technologies in terms of energy efficiency and emissions.
