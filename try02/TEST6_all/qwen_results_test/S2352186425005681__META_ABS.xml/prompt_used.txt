You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Viability of zeolites obtained from hazardous aluminum industry waste for soil remediation The effectiveness of two zeolites, type LTA and NaP (called ZA and ZB, respectively), synthesized using hazardous aluminium industry waste, was evaluated for the remediation of a soil polluted with metal(loid)s and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The influence of zeolite amendment on soil physicochemical properties and its associated phytotoxicity was also assessed. Batch experiments were conducted in a climatic chamber with zeolite doses of 0 %, 0.5 %, and 1 %. At 7 and 30 days, the availability of As, Fe, Ni, and Pb was determined. After 30 days of incubation, soil physicochemical characteristics, PCB concentrations, and phytotoxicity, were analyzed. Both zeolites induced a dose-dependent increase in soil pH—particularly notable for ZA at 1 %—and in electrical conductivity, although the latter remained within normal range for soils. While the two zeolites reduced metal(loid) availability in soil, they showed a different behavior. In this regard, ZA was more effective at immobilizing As and Ni, while ZB performed better for Pb. Regarding PCBs, soil incubation under our experimental conditions reduced the content of most of these contaminants, even in the control sample, probably as a result of biodegradation, and the addition of zeolites did not enhance this process. Thus, sustainable zeolites obtained from hazardous aluminum industry waste emerge as promising material for soil decontamination processes, thereby contributing to the principles of the circular economy. However, further studies combining zeolites with other agents are required to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment without adversely impacting soil properties.
