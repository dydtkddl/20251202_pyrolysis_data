You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Suppression of nano-polymethyl methacrylate dust explosions by ABC powder The suppression effects of ABC powder on 100 nm polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) dust explosions with different mass densities were experimentally studied. Results showed that the suppressed flames were dim and the flame propagation was slowed down with the addition of ABC powder. When the proportion of suppressant increased, the average propagation velocity was decreased. After adding 30% ABC powder to 650 g/m3 PMMA dust cloud, the maximum suppression ratio for velocity was 93%. After adding 10% ABC powder, the temperatures of PMMA dust cloud with the mass densities of 250 g/m3, 450 g/m3 and 650 g/m3 were decreased to 19.8%, 27.4% and 33.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, the critical suppression proportion of PMMA dust explosion with three mass densities were 25%, 35% and 35%. Thermal analysis results showed that the addition of suppressant could increase the thermal stability of PMMA. The suppression mechanisms were comprised of physical suppression and chemical suppression which reflected on the consumption of H and OH radicals. The chemical kinetic models indicated that PO2 and HOPO played a catalytic role in the combination of H and OH.
