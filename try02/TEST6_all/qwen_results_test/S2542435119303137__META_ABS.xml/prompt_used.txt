You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced Catalyst Durability for Bio-Based Adipic Acid Production by Atomic Layer Deposition Atomic layer deposition (ALD) improves the durability of metal catalysts using nanoscale metal oxide coatings. However, targeted coating strategies and economic models are lacking for process-specific deactivation challenges that account for implications at scale. Herein, we apply Al2O3 ALD to Pd/TiO2 to increase durability during hydrogenation of muconic acid, a bio-based platform chemical, to adipic acid. Initial coating development and characterization are performed on the milligram scale using stop-flow ALD. Subsequently, ALD coating scale is increased by 3 orders of magnitude using fluidized bed ALD. Activity, leaching resistance, and thermal stability are evaluated at each synthesis scale. ALD-coated catalysts retain up to 2-fold greater muconic acid hydrogenation activity and undergo significantly less physical restructuring than uncoated Pd/TiO2 after high-temperature treatments, while reducing Pd leaching by over 4-fold. Techno-economic analysis for an adipic acid biorefinery supports increased ALD material costs through catalyst lifetime extension, underscoring the potential viability of this technology.
