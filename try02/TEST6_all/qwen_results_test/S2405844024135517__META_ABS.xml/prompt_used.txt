You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of alkali catalysts on product yield and Si-containing products from hydrothermal liquefaction of corn stover This study investigated the effects of different alkali catalysts (K2CO3, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) on the yield and composition of biocrude oil and aqueous products obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of corn stover. HTL was performed in a laboratory-scale tubular reactor at 320 °C for 90 min and catalyst loading of 5.0 and 7.5 % (by weight of biomass). The composition of the biocrude oil and aqueous products was determined using GC-MS. Results revealed that hydroxide catalysts are more effective than carbonate catalysts in increasing biocrude oil yield. Notably, NaOH achieved a high conversion rate of 92–94 % daf (dry and ash-free basis), significantly surpassing the uncatalyzed HTL (69.4 % daf). The highest biocrude oil yield of 22.12–22.57 % daf was obtained using KOH. Si-containing compounds (e.g., silanes and siloxanes) were identified as the most abundant components in the biocrude oil, suggesting potential for further exploration in producing platform chemicals from these compounds.
