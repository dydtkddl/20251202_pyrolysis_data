Influence of alkali catalysts on product yield and Si-containing products from hydrothermal liquefaction of corn stover This study investigated the effects of different alkali catalysts (K2CO3, KOH, NaOH, and Na2CO3) on the yield and composition of biocrude oil and aqueous products obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of corn stover. HTL was performed in a laboratory-scale tubular reactor at 320 °C for 90 min and catalyst loading of 5.0 and 7.5 % (by weight of biomass). The composition of the biocrude oil and aqueous products was determined using GC-MS. Results revealed that hydroxide catalysts are more effective than carbonate catalysts in increasing biocrude oil yield. Notably, NaOH achieved a high conversion rate of 92–94 % daf (dry and ash-free basis), significantly surpassing the uncatalyzed HTL (69.4 % daf). The highest biocrude oil yield of 22.12–22.57 % daf was obtained using KOH. Si-containing compounds (e.g., silanes and siloxanes) were identified as the most abundant components in the biocrude oil, suggesting potential for further exploration in producing platform chemicals from these compounds.
