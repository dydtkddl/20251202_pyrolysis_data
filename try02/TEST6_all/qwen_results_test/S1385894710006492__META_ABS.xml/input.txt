Deactivation and coke combustion studies of nanocrystalline zeolite beta in catalytic cracking of used palm oil Nanocrystalline zeolite beta was synthesized and its catalytic cracking activity for the production of biofuel from used palm oil was determined. The catalyst was characterized for its crystallinity, surface properties and morphology. The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic cracking activity of nanocrystalline zeolite beta was also studied. The catalyst deactivation was monitored with the time on stream data by varying the palm oil to catalyst ratio of 6–14 at different temperatures. The deactivation data were analyzed using activity models and the deactivation parameters were obtained. The combustion behavior of the coked nanocrystalline zeolite beta derived at various coking temperature was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The regeneration of the cracking catalyst was strongly correlated with the coke combustion kinetics. The coke combustion kinetics was studied and activation energy for coke combustion was determined.
