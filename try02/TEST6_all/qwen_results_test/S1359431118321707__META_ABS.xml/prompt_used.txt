You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A hybrid simulation of a 600 MW supercritical circulating fluidized bed boiler system A hybrid dynamic model for a 600 MW supercritical circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler is presented. The combustion system includes combustion chamber, cyclone separator, standpipe, and ash cooler. The steam-water system mainly contains water wall, external heat exchanger, superheater, reheater, and economizer. The ‘core-annulus cell model’ is employed to simulate complex physical and chemical processes in the boiler. A series of classical empirical models have been chosen to model main physical and chemical processes. The water-steam system is modelled by means of modular modelling method, a new user-defined model for external heat exchanger is established and validated. The combustion system is coupled with the water-steam system via heat exchange in water wall tubes. The static state calculation is taken to compare with the design values indicating the model has reached a rather high precision. Dynamic simulations under three typical transient conditions are conducted which are 5% fuel decrease, 5% secondary air decrease and 5% supply water decrease, respectively. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model is capable of performing good characteristics of CFB. The modelling method has important theoretical and engineering values for researchers, and the hyrbid model can be very helpful to optimize operating and design parameters to get a better performance of large-scale commercial CFB.
