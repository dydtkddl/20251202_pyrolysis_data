You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multiscale study on supercritical water gasification of agricultural films plastics: from experimental performance to molecular mechanisms Agricultural film plastics, due to their persistence and low recyclability, present a significant environmental challenge yet offer untapped potential for energy recovery. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) offers a promising strategy for efficiently converting these polymer wastes into valuable energy products. In this study, SCWG of agricultural films is comprehensively investigated by a multiscale approach that integrates experimental evaluation of gasification performance and microscale insights into reaction pathways via molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Experimental results reveal that temperature is a key factor affecting gas yield and composition. At 700 ℃, the hydrogen conversion rate reaches 97.4 wt%, accompanied by a significant reduction in long-chain hydrocarbons and the formation of uniform carbon microspheres, indicating efficient cracking and suppression of tar-like by-products. Reaction time is also critical: while extended durations enhance gasification, exceeding 20 min leads to increased CO2 production via water–gas shift reactions, thereby compromising syngas quality. MD simulations show that elevated temperatures disrupt hydrogen-bond networks in supercritical water, enhancing polyethylene chain mobility and reactivity. DFT analyses further indicate that monoradical species (•R) preferentially produce methane through β-H transfer mechanisms, offering higher selectivity than C–C homolytic cleavage. Additionally, diradical species (•R•) facilitate aromatization pathways. These findings offer advancing understanding of SCWG for the disposal of agricultural plastic waste.
