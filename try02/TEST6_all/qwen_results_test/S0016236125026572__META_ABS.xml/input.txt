Multiscale study on supercritical water gasification of agricultural films plastics: from experimental performance to molecular mechanisms Agricultural film plastics, due to their persistence and low recyclability, present a significant environmental challenge yet offer untapped potential for energy recovery. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) offers a promising strategy for efficiently converting these polymer wastes into valuable energy products. In this study, SCWG of agricultural films is comprehensively investigated by a multiscale approach that integrates experimental evaluation of gasification performance and microscale insights into reaction pathways via molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Experimental results reveal that temperature is a key factor affecting gas yield and composition. At 700 ℃, the hydrogen conversion rate reaches 97.4 wt%, accompanied by a significant reduction in long-chain hydrocarbons and the formation of uniform carbon microspheres, indicating efficient cracking and suppression of tar-like by-products. Reaction time is also critical: while extended durations enhance gasification, exceeding 20 min leads to increased CO2 production via water–gas shift reactions, thereby compromising syngas quality. MD simulations show that elevated temperatures disrupt hydrogen-bond networks in supercritical water, enhancing polyethylene chain mobility and reactivity. DFT analyses further indicate that monoradical species (•R) preferentially produce methane through β-H transfer mechanisms, offering higher selectivity than C–C homolytic cleavage. Additionally, diradical species (•R•) facilitate aromatization pathways. These findings offer advancing understanding of SCWG for the disposal of agricultural plastic waste.
