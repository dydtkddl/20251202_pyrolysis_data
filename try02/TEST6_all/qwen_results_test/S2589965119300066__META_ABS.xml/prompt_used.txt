You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Some basic aspects of polymer nanocomposites: A critical review Polymer nanocomposites have been investigated for about three decades. To get deep insights into the modifying effects of various nanofillers on mechanical and physical properties of polymer nanocomposites, the three basic aspects of processing, characterization and properties are critically reviewed in this paper. Nanofillers can be classified into three major types of two-dimensional (2D) layered, one-dimensional (1D) fibrous and zero-dimensional (0D) spherical ones and this review thus discusses in detail the processing, characterization and properties of the three types of polymer nanocomposites. It starts with an introduction of various nanoscale fillers such as two-dimensional (2D) nano-clay, graphene and MXene, one dimensional (1D) carbon nanofibers and nanotubes, zero dimensional (0D) silica nanoparticles and ZnO quantum dots as well as nanofiller-polymer interfaces. The processing of these polymer nanocomposites using different methods and the characterization of nanofillers and polymer nanocomposites using various techniques are described. Finally, the mechanical and physical properties of these polymer nanocomposites are discussed by considering the effects of nanofiller type, dispersion and contents; also, interface properties show significant effects on the mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites and are discussed in some details.
