The volatilization of heavy metals during co-combustion of food waste and polyvinyl chloride in air and carbon dioxide/oxygen atmosphere The volatilization of three heavy metals (Cd, Cr and Zn) during food waste and PVC and their blending combustion in N2/O2 or CO2/O2 atmosphere in a lab-scale tubular furnace was investigated. The concentration of heavy metals in combustion ash was decreased with the increment of furnace temperature in most cases. The replacement of 80N2/20O2 by 80CO2/20O2 decreased the volatilization rate of Cd and Cr, but increased Zn. The increased amount of PVC added into food waste led to less content of Zn in combustion ash, 5% PVC added into food waste decreased the volatilization rate of Cr but 15% PVC added led to the higher volatilization. The volatilization rate of Zn in 70CO2/30O2 was significantly lower than in 85CO2/15O2 or 80CO2/20O2. The result contributes to the understanding of heavy metal volatilization during incineration and emission control of MSW oxy-fuel combustion.
