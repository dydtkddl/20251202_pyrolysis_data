Recent advancements in sustainable production and consumption: Recycling processes and impacts for additive manufacturing The use of recycled polymers in additive manufacturing (AM), a. k.a. three-dimensional printing (3DP), has gained recognition recently due to its potential to minimize plastic waste and support sustainable manufacturing practices. Recycled polymers offer numerous benefits and potential uses in 3DP, making them an attractive option for sustainable production and waste management practices. Reinforcements can enhance the properties of recycled polymers, allowing for the production of complex objects with diverse properties. Optimizing printing parameters is crucial for understanding the specific needs of each material to enhance recycling outcomes and preserve material integrity. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on 3DP using recycled polymers, chemical and mechanical recycling methods, and the effects of reinforcements, multiple recycling cycles, and printing parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed objects. Despite progress, research gaps remain regarding economic feasibility, environmental impact, and long-term durability. Filling these gaps could unlock the full potential of 3DP with recycled polymers and support the transition towards a circular economy.
