Ultrafast Synthesis for Functional Nanomaterials Nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention in the field of energy storage and conversion because of their unique functions. Compared with conventional methods, the ultrafast synthesis strategy with exceptional kinetic conditions shows great potential and broad prospects in controllable metastable material fabrication. Herein, the mechanisms and advantages of representative ultrafast synthesis approaches, including spray pyrolysis (SP), microwave (MW), laser ablation in liquid (LAL), and high-temperature shock (HTS) are introduced. HTS is highlighted as the latest technique for nanomaterials with tunable properties. These recent advances evidence the potential of ultrafast synthesis toward performance-tunable nanosized materials for various applications. Finally, we summarize the key issues remains to be resolved and provide an outlook that may be beneficial to guide future development of this promising field.
