Characterization of aromatic hydrocarbon formation from pyrolysis of polyethylene-polystyrene mixtures Design and operating parameters, and cause and effect relationships among feedstocks and products in the pyrolysis of waste polymers are needed if this method of processing is to be used for energy recovery from waste plastics. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of various operating factors for the pyrolysis of common polymeric wastes. Experiments were performed using a conventional retort tube as a batch reactor. The operating factors considered were temperature and reaction time at constant heating rate. High density polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS), the most common plastic waste in Korea, were used singly and in mixture. The pyrolysis time for maximum oil production from a PE-PS mixture was shorter than in the case of PE alone, showing an enhancement effect from the PS. The maximum gas production time from PE-PS mixtures was shorter than for PE alone at 500° C; above 600° C, this does not occur. Small aromatic compounds (which can be valuable) are produced at maximum with an 1:1 mixture of PE and PS at 600° C, showing the possibility of process control for the maximum recovery of desirable pyrolysis products. The maximum yield of toluene, xylene, styrene, and 1-propenyl benzene were 8.6, 8.9, 51.0 and 7.4 wt.% of feed for pyrolysis PS at 700° C, respectively. For naphthalene, it was at 700° C with 1:1 PE:PS (by wt.). The maximum recovery was 1.3 wt.%. Diels-Alder theory can explain the formation of aromatic compounds in the pyrolysis products. The yield of these secondary pyrolysis products can be controlled by reaction time, pyrolysis temperature and mixing ratio of plastic wastes in the pyrolysis feed.
