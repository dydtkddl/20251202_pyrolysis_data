Greener synthesis of functionalized graphene oxide for the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide present in natural gas Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized through the thermal decomposition (TD) of citric acid (CA) through an alternative and more environmentally friendly route than the conventional method. Functionalization with amine (diethylenetriamine) was performed (GOF-DETA) to impart basic characteristics to GO, and impregnated copper (GOF-DETA + Cu) was used to improve the selectivity. The functionalization and impregnation were performed via ultrasonication, a green methodology facilitating homogenization and GO sheet formation. FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of the materials. XRD revealed an increase in the interplanar distance of 0.49 nm for GO and 0.57 nm for GOF-DETA and GOF-DETA + Cu. BET analysis demonstrated a significant increase in surface area, with GO having 18 m2 g−1 and GOF-DETA exhibiting 456 m2 g−1. In the adsorption tests, GOF-DETA and GOF-DETA + Cu exhibited H2S adsorption capacities of 158 and 395 mg g−1, respectively. Consequently, the synthesis of GO through the TD of CA offers an alternative, efficient, and environmentally friendly route, and amine functionalization using ultrasound further enhances its properties. Among the produced and tested materials, GOF-DETA + Cu showed superior results, making it the most promising adsorbent for natural gas desulfurization in this study.
