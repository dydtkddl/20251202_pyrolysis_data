You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tire-additive chemicals and their derivatives in urban road dust: Spatial distributions, exposures, and associations with tire and road wear particles Tires, as a globally utilized product, emit pollutants including various tire-additive chemicals (TACs), and tire and road wear particles (TRWPs) containing substantial microplastics. Several TACs have been proven to have aquatic toxicity, induce health risks including endocrine disruption, allergic effects, and cardiovascular problems, while TRWPs are also very strongly suspected. With the emergence of multiple novel TAC derivatives recently, yet knowledge of their occurrence, spatial distribution, and potential associations remains largely insufficient. In this work, we have systematically investigated 25 TACs, including para-phenylenediamine (PPDs), several newly identified quinones (PPD-Qs) first reported in urban dust, and TRWPs across road dust from Hong Kong and Berlin. By coupling UPLC-MS/MS and pyrolysis-GC/MS analyses, we achieved concurrent quantification of trace TAC derivatives and TRWPs. Distinct spatial patterns of these tire-derived contaminants were identified, in which Hong Kong exhibited higher TACs linked to dense traffic, while the TRWP levels reached 9420 μg/g near auto factory in Berlin. Highway dust contained maximum contaminant loads of both TACs (5.0-fold higher) and TRWPs (5.3-fold higher) compared to other road types. Significantly linear associations were found between emerging TAC derivatives and TRWPs, implying their potential as candidate markers. Exposure assessments revealed PPDs and PPD-Qs intake doses surpassed benzothiazole and its derivatives, highlighting non-negligible risks caused by emerging TAC derivatives. This work establishes a framework for evaluating region-specific emission drivers and provides critical baseline data of multiple tire-related contaminants across different compartments. Potential markers for TRWPs were identified, which may be further utilized for their identification and determination.
