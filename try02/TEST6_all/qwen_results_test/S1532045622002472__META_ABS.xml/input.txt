Effect of size continuum from nanoplastics to microplastics on marine mussel Mytilus edulis: Comparison in vitro/in vivo exposure scenarios For several decades, plastic has been a global threat in terms of pollution. Plastic polymers, when introduce in the aquatic environment, are exposed to fragmentation processes into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) which could potentially interact with living organisms. The objective of this work was to study the effects of plastic particles representative of those found in the environment, on the marine mussels Mytilus edulis, under two exposure scenarios: in vivo and in vitro. Whole mussels or cultured hemocytes were exposed for 24 h to NPs and MPs generated from macro-sized plastics collected in the field, but also to reference NPs, at concentrations found in the environment: 0.08, 10 μg and 100 μg·L−1. Results showed that immune response was only activated when mussels were exposed in vivo. However, cytotoxicity (hemocyte mortality) and genotoxicity (DNA damage) parameters were induced after both types of exposure, but in a dose-dependent manner after in vitro hemocyte exposure to all tested plastic conditions. These results indicate that in vitro approaches could be considered as potential predictors of in vivo exposures.
