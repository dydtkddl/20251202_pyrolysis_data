You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of sustainable aviation biofuels via catalytic hydropyrolysis of lignin The exploitation of bimetallic catalysts to lignin for sustainable aviation biofuels remains a daunting challenge due to the low selectivity of aviation biofuel-range hydrocarbons and inconsistent reaction mechanism. Herein, bimetallic supported on SiO2 catalysts were prepared and their hydrodeoxygenation reactivity during lignin catalytic hydropyrolysis was explored. Approximately 100 % selectivity toward aviation-range hydrocarbons were achieved using eugenol as model compound under relatively mild conditions with the presence of NiMo/SiO2. For lignin catalytic hydropyrolysis, the yield of liquid hydrocarbons and the selectivity of aviation-range hydrocarbons was 21.99 wt% and 70.50 %, respectively. High mass balance (89.66 %) was verified by scale-up experiments in a continuous flow high-pressure reactor system. The reactivity of demethoxylation reaction, dehydroxylation reaction, and benzene ring hydrogenation reaction with the presence of bimetallic catalysts were analyzed. The density functional theory calculation and verification experiments revealed the evolution pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloalkanes from lignin catalytic hydropyrolysis. The proposed reaction mechanism can provide guidance for the regulation of aviation biofuel components from lignin catalytic hydropyrolysis.
