You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adhesive bonding of a mixed short and continuous carbon-fiber-reinforced Nylon-6 composite made via fused filament fabrication This experimental work aims at evaluating the mechanical and failure behavior of adhesive-bonded single-lap joints made of a thermoplastic composite 3D-printed via Fused Filament Fabrication technology. Carbon fiber was selected as the reinforcement and used in the form of both short and continuous fibers embedded in the Nylon-6 matrix, forming the composite's hybrid structure. An approach based on progressive improvement of surface treatment effectiveness (solvent degreasing, abrasion, and low-pressure plasma) has been adopted to verify how the additively-manufactured composite responds to bonding when increased interfacial adhesion is attained by preparing the outer printed layer. Roughness measurements, wettability evaluations, and XPS analyses have been carried out to assess any modifications of morphology and functionalization exhibited by the different surfaces after treatment. The experimental findings demonstrate that the intrinsic non-homogeneity of 3D-printed composites is emphasized when low-pressure plasma is used, as it generates interfacial bonds between adhesive and adherend that are more effective than the interlaminar ones within the substrate. In this condition, the ultimate resistance of the joint corresponds to that of the base material. In particular, fracture-mechanism analysis allowed precise identification of the crack path, highlighting defects and current limitations of the additively-manufactured system and suggesting pivotal aspects to develop in future work to improve joint performance.
