You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic hydroreforming of the polyethylene thermal cracking oil over Ni supported hierarchical zeolites and mesostructured aluminosilicates The hydroreforming of the liquid product resulting from LDPE thermal cracking at 400°C (C5–C40) has been studied using Ni supported hierarchical zeolites (Ni/h-ZSM-5, Ni/h-Beta) and mesostructured materials (Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-SBA-15) as catalysts. Hydroreforming experiments were carried out at 310°C under 20bar of hydrogen. All the catalysts were synthesized with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 30 and a Ni content of 7wt%. According to XRD, TPR and TEM data, the activated catalysts displayed Ni particles both over the external surface and inside the catalyst pores in different percentages depending on their porous structure and nature. Complete hydrogenation of the olefins was observed over both mesostructured catalysts (Ni/Al-SBA-15 and Ni/Al-MCM-41) and hierarchical Ni/h-Beta. In contrast, over Ni/h-ZSM-5, there is always left about 30% of olefins, due to an imbalance in the acid and metal function. Ni/h-ZSM-5 led towards significant amounts of gases (∼18%) while gasoline range hydrocarbons were the main products (55%) over Ni/h-Beta, at the expense of diesel fractions. In contrast, the hydrocracking extent was far lower over Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/Al-SBA-15, the latter showing additionally the appearance of a slight degree of oligomerization, which led towards an increase in the heavy diesel fraction (C19–C40). Hydroisomerization reactions also occur, mostly in the case of Ni supported hierarchical zeolites. Likewise, aromatics were formed over these catalysts in a large extent. The RON number of the gasolines obtained at 310°C was within 81–89 depending on the chosen catalysts while the cetane index (CCI) of the diesel fraction was around 70–80. On the other hand, Ni leaching was not detected.
