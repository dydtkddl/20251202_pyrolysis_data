Coupled matrix-based Monte Carlo modeling for a mechanistic understanding of poly (methyl methacrylate) thermochemical recycling kinetics Coupled matrix-based Monte Carlo (CMMC) modeling is applied to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the thermochemical degradation of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). We take into account six elementary fission reaction types, five elementary β-scission reaction types, as well as termination by recombination and disproportionation. Additionally, we consider the influence of chain length-dependent diffusional limitations. To tune the Arrhenius parameters of the elementary reactions with enhanced sensitivity, we perform thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with (i) well-defined heating rates (2, 4, and 8 K.min−1) and (ii) starting from well-defined PMMA feedstocks (different average chain lengths and defect levels), as pinpointed from CMMC modeling of their synthesis. Our results reveal that head-head fission plays a crucial role at lower temperatures, while a complex interplay of various elementary reactions initiated through various fission reactions occurs at higher temperatures. The CMMC model provides insights to optimize lab scale degradation reaction conditions for efficient PMMA unzipping, considering a general temperature profile. Furthermore, the model enables us to track the evolution of the molar mass distribution, particularly the contribution of heavier components.
