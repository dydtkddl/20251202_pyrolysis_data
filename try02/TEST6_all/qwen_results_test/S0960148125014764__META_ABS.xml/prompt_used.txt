You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal behavior and products characteristics during furfural residue co-pyrolysis with waste plastic Furfural residue (FR) is a biomass waste generated during furfural production, while waste plastic is a common type of organic solid waste. In this study, co-pyrolysis of FR and polypropylene (PP) was carried out to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperature, waste plastic mixing ratio and in-situ catalyst on product properties. It was shown that an increase in the plastic mixing ratio significantly affected the composition of gas and liquid products, with a decrease in oxygenated compounds and an increase in hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil. The CnHm content in pyrolysis gas increased. The hydroxyl (O-H) content in pyrolysis char decreases, and the specific surface area decreases from 375.235 m2/g to 269.569 m2/g. The largest increase in olefin content in oil is achieved at a plastic ratio of 0.6. As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the formation of hydrocarbons is promoted, and the content reaches 55.92 % at 500oC. Aromatic yield (37.5 %) and H2 yield (12.07 %) were highest with the addition of ZSM-5 catalyst, while alkane yield (24.89 %) and CO yield (15.78 %) were highest with MgO catalyst. The acid and ester content of pyrolysis oil decreased while the hydrocarbon content increased when CaO catalyst was used.
