You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transforming waste to worth: Integrated multi-tech green approaches for environment-friendly and sustainable production of bio-enzymes, bio-cleaners, and organic acids from fruit waste Large-scale generation of waste by food processing industries and a lack of efficient waste management cause environmental pollution, global greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. Further, the spread of microbial diseases because of waste degradation affects public health and causes an excessive burden on the overall economy. Valorisation of bio-wastes can generate valuable products, such as bio cleaners and organic acids, which can significantly contribute towards a green economy. Implementing sustainable waste management programs at the ground level has the potential to enhance value and leverage the rising prices of natural products. This review provides a critical discussion on the sustainable production of organic acids and bio-cleaners from fruit by-products using modern extraction technologies and alternative pathways. Process intensification techniques and mitigation of existing challenges in the techno-economic perspective, achieving a zero-waste strategy, has been conversed for the production of valuable compounds at commercial scale. The necessity of further research for sustainable and cleaner production of highly valued compounds from fruit wastes using the state-of-the-art multi-tech approaches is emphasized.
