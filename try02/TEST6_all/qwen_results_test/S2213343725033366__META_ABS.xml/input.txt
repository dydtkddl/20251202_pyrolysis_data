Transforming waste to worth: Integrated multi-tech green approaches for environment-friendly and sustainable production of bio-enzymes, bio-cleaners, and organic acids from fruit waste Large-scale generation of waste by food processing industries and a lack of efficient waste management cause environmental pollution, global greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change. Further, the spread of microbial diseases because of waste degradation affects public health and causes an excessive burden on the overall economy. Valorisation of bio-wastes can generate valuable products, such as bio cleaners and organic acids, which can significantly contribute towards a green economy. Implementing sustainable waste management programs at the ground level has the potential to enhance value and leverage the rising prices of natural products. This review provides a critical discussion on the sustainable production of organic acids and bio-cleaners from fruit by-products using modern extraction technologies and alternative pathways. Process intensification techniques and mitigation of existing challenges in the techno-economic perspective, achieving a zero-waste strategy, has been conversed for the production of valuable compounds at commercial scale. The necessity of further research for sustainable and cleaner production of highly valued compounds from fruit wastes using the state-of-the-art multi-tech approaches is emphasized.
