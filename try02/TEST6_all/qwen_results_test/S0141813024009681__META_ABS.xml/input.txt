“Development and characterization of edible films based on starch isolated from different Colombian potato varieties” This work reports on the extraction and characterization of the behavior of starch from residues of several potato varieties (Criolla, Sabanera and Pastusa) of Colombian origin from the Andean region using different techniques and the evaluation of the effect of citric acid (CA) on the grain morphology. Additionally, films were produced with each one of the extracted starches and glycerol. Pastusa variety starch shows a higher granule size than the other varieties and Pastusa starch shows lower amylose content compared to Sabanera and Criolla. Criolla and Pastusa starches exhibit more thermal stability than Sabanera starch. Starch-glycerol films were also produced using the cast solving method. The films were mechanically analyzed by tensile test and the barrier properties were assessed by water vapor permeability (WVP). The tensile strength of the films varied in the 2.0–2.4 MPa range, while the elongation at break was comprised between 25 and 32 %. With regard to water vapor permeability, the obtained values fall within the 4–7 × 10–10 g m-1 s-1 Pa-1 range. It was observed that the thickness of the films and the protein content affected water vapor permeability, increasing this value at higher levels of thickness.
