You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

“Development and characterization of edible films based on starch isolated from different Colombian potato varieties” This work reports on the extraction and characterization of the behavior of starch from residues of several potato varieties (Criolla, Sabanera and Pastusa) of Colombian origin from the Andean region using different techniques and the evaluation of the effect of citric acid (CA) on the grain morphology. Additionally, films were produced with each one of the extracted starches and glycerol. Pastusa variety starch shows a higher granule size than the other varieties and Pastusa starch shows lower amylose content compared to Sabanera and Criolla. Criolla and Pastusa starches exhibit more thermal stability than Sabanera starch. Starch-glycerol films were also produced using the cast solving method. The films were mechanically analyzed by tensile test and the barrier properties were assessed by water vapor permeability (WVP). The tensile strength of the films varied in the 2.0–2.4 MPa range, while the elongation at break was comprised between 25 and 32 %. With regard to water vapor permeability, the obtained values fall within the 4–7 × 10–10 g m-1 s-1 Pa-1 range. It was observed that the thickness of the films and the protein content affected water vapor permeability, increasing this value at higher levels of thickness.
