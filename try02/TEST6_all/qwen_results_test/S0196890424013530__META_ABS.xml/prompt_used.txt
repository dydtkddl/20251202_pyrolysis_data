You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating waste valorization potential through the co-pyrolysis of waste activated sludge and polyethylene terephthalate: Analysis on thermal degradation behavior, kinetic properties and by-products Waste activated sludge (WAS) derived from food manufacturing poses critical environmental threats, necessitating sustainable management strategies. To address the challenges associated with the high moisture and ash contents of WAS, co-pyrolysis that incorporates polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a potential solution to transform WAS into value-added bio-products. In this study, the synergistic interactions between WAS and PET during co-pyrolysis were evaluated in terms of their thermal degradation behaviors, kinetics, and evolved volatiles at different blending ratios (3:1, 1:1, 1:3). The results revealed that the addition of PET synergistically enhanced the WAS decomposition, while the degradation of PET was inhibited at a high WAS fraction. Kinetic analysis further confirmed the interactions between WAS and PET, as the activation energies became higher than the additive values when the process reached the main degradation region of PET. The favorability of co-pyrolysis was proven by the less complicated reaction models that govern the kinetics of the blends, as well as the small difference between the values of activation energy and enthalpy change (4–6 kJ/mol). Evolved gas analysis revealed that co-pyrolysis of WAS and PET may undergo a greener alternative pathway to produce aromatic-rich bio-oil with much lower carbon dioxide emissions, as compared to pyrolysis of PET alone. These findings demonstrate the advantages of co-pyrolysis over the individual pyrolysis of WAS and PET, forming the theoretical basis for the upscaling of this technology and the effective valorization of hazardous wastes.
