You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of Douglas Fir and low-density polyethylene with nanocellulose-derived carbon catalyst for enhancing selectivity of hydrogen in syngas and mono-aromatic hydrocarbon in bio-oil products To enhance the quality of raw bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of biomass, hydrogen-rich reactants such as waste plastics, cooking oils, and soap stock are frequently incorporated into the fast catalytic co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of biomass. Nevertheless, widespread uses of acids, bases, and zeolite catalysts must address concerns such as easy to coke, regeneration challenges, and environmental impacts. In this study, one green carbon catalyst is derived from nanocellulose (NCCC) and then firstly applied to co-pyrolyze the Douglas Fir (DF), a typical lumber species in North America, together with low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a commonly used plastic. The use of NCCC during feedstock co-pyrolysis boosted the formation of aromatics, particularly the mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in bio-oil and H2-rich gaseous products, with a selectivity of H2 to 65 vol.%, nearly double the selectivity without catalysts. Even after five consecutive applications, the NCCC still displays good catalytic effectiveness in the co-pyrolysis: its selectivity for H2 in gaseous products (48 area%) after five-time usage is virtually equal to that without catalysts (46 area%). Moreover, the mechanism of the NCCC application was investigated by applying the NCCC in a co-pyrolysis of LDPE and DF, along with their individual pyrolysis at temperatures ranging from 450 to 800 °C. This research investigated the potential catalytic impacts of NCCC in co-CFP process, aiming to provide an affordable, eco-friendly heterogeneous catalyst to replace existing acid/base catalysts in the conversion of biomass.
