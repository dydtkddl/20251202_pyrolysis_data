Cracking of F-T refined wax for producing linear α-olefin The steam cracking of Fischer-Tropsch refined wax from the coal-to-oil process for producing linear α-olefin (LAO) was carried out on a fixed bed reactor. The effects of feedstock composition, cracking temperature, contact time, water-to-wax ratio and cyclic process on the feed conversion and products distribution were investigated and optimized. The factors such as cracking temperature and contact time have significant influence on conversion and LAO yield, and cyclic process can further improve the LAO yield. However, excess high cracking temperature and longer contact time result in the second reactions, which are unfavorable for the LAO production. Under the suitable process conditions 53% of LAO yield are obtained.
