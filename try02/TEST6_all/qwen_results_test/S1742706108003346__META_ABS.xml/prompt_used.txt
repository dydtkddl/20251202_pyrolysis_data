You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Composite fibrous biomaterials for tissue engineering obtained using a supercritical CO2 antisolvent process Several techniques have been proposed for producing porous structures or scaffolds for tissue engineering but, as yet, with no optimal solution. With regard to this topic, this paper focuses on the preparation of biocompatible nanometric filler–polymer composites organized in a network of fibers. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) or hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanopowders as the guest particles and poly(lactic acid) (L-PLA) or the blend poly(methylmethacrylate)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (PMMA/PCL) as the polymer carrier were selected as model systems for this purpose. A supercritical antisolvent technique was used to produce the composites. In the process developed, the non-soluble particulate filler was suspended in a polymer solution, and both components were sprayed simultaneously into supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). Using this technique, polymeric matrices were loaded with ∼10–20wt.% of inorganic phase distributed throughout the composite. Two different hybrid materials were prepared: a PMMA/PCL+TiO2 system where either fibers or microparticles were prepared by varying the molecular weight of the used PMMA; and fibers in the case of L-PLA+HAP system. After further post-processing in a three-dimensional network, these nanofibers can potentially be used as scaffolds for tissue engineering.
