You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deactivation of nickel catalysts in methane cracking reaction: Effect of bimodal meso–macropore structure of silica support In this research, the pore characteristics of catalyst supports have been taken into consideration in order to prolong the life time of catalysts from coke deposition in methane cracking reaction. Consequently, the monomodal porous silica supports with straight pore (SBA-15) and sinusoidal pore (Xerogel-5) of similar mesopore size, and bimodal porous silica supports with straight pores (MCM-41) and sinusoidal pores (BPS-5) of different pore sizes were applied as the supports for nickel catalyst. An aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) was used as the catalyst precursor and loaded onto the supports by using incipient wetness impregnation method. The performance and life time of the obtained catalysts in methane cracking reaction were investigated using a fixed-bed reactor at a temperature range of 500–650°C at atmospheric pressure (CH4 diluted with N2 at a volume ratio of 1:4). The highest methane conversion and longest catalyst life time were obtained at a lower reaction temperature (500°C) with Ni/BPS-5 catalyst, as its effective diffusion coefficient was approximately 8.5 times higher than that of Ni/Xerogel-5 catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst with straight pore (Ni/SBA-15) exhibited a slightly higher effective diffusion coefficient and catalytic performance than that with sinusoidal pore (Ni/Xerogel-5).
