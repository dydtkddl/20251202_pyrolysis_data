Deactivation of nickel catalysts in methane cracking reaction: Effect of bimodal meso–macropore structure of silica support In this research, the pore characteristics of catalyst supports have been taken into consideration in order to prolong the life time of catalysts from coke deposition in methane cracking reaction. Consequently, the monomodal porous silica supports with straight pore (SBA-15) and sinusoidal pore (Xerogel-5) of similar mesopore size, and bimodal porous silica supports with straight pores (MCM-41) and sinusoidal pores (BPS-5) of different pore sizes were applied as the supports for nickel catalyst. An aqueous solution of nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) was used as the catalyst precursor and loaded onto the supports by using incipient wetness impregnation method. The performance and life time of the obtained catalysts in methane cracking reaction were investigated using a fixed-bed reactor at a temperature range of 500–650°C at atmospheric pressure (CH4 diluted with N2 at a volume ratio of 1:4). The highest methane conversion and longest catalyst life time were obtained at a lower reaction temperature (500°C) with Ni/BPS-5 catalyst, as its effective diffusion coefficient was approximately 8.5 times higher than that of Ni/Xerogel-5 catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst with straight pore (Ni/SBA-15) exhibited a slightly higher effective diffusion coefficient and catalytic performance than that with sinusoidal pore (Ni/Xerogel-5).
