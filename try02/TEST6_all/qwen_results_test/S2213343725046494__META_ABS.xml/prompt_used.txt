You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The nexuses of micro(nano)plastics at environmental interfaces: Challenges in wastewater treatment and sustainable water management Micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) have emerged as persistent and complex pollutants, particularly within aquatic systems, with reported concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 particles/L in freshwater and up to 10,000 particles/m3 in marine environments. Their small size, diverse sources, and high surface reactivity enable interactions with co-contaminants and facilitate long-range transport, posing significant ecological and human health risks. This review explores the critical nexuses of MNPs at environmental interfaces, emphasizing their occurrence in aquatic systems, removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and implications for sustainable water management. Bibliometric analysis was used to elucidate research trends, hotspots, and knowledge gaps. The paper discusses MNP transport, persistence, and ecological impacts, as well as current monitoring and detection techniques, highlighting limitations in quantification at sizes below 1 µ m. Conventional WWTPs typically achieve 20–90 % removal of MPs, depending on treatment stages, while advanced approaches—including membrane filtration, adsorption using biochar, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, as well as photocatalytic and electrochemical methods—demonstrate enhanced efficiencies, often exceeding 95 % removal under lab conditions. Policy frameworks and regulatory responses are examined, emphasizing the need for harmonized international standards. Finally, key research needs are outlined, including the development of standardized analytical methods, life cycle assessments, and integrated treatment strategies. Overall, this work provides a multidisciplinary overview of MNP pollution, guiding future research, technological innovation, and policy toward safer and more sustainable water systems.
