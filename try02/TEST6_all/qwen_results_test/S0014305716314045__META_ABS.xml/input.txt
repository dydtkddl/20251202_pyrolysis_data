Star-shaped lactic acid based systems and their thermosetting resins; synthesis, characterization, potential opportunities and drawbacks Shortcomings of the conventional PLA synthesis methods have encouraged researchers to investigate on alternative methods for PLA synthesis. Utilization of chain extenders is an effective way to achieve high MW polymers. The concept of using star-shaped resins as the reinforced matrices for biocomposites or in biomedical applications is gaining more and more attention day by day. Star-shaped lactic acid based resins are a class of branched resins with a multifunctional core molecule and lactic acid branches. In order to increase the reactivity of branches, the star-shaped resin oligomers can get end-functionalized which yields in a crosslinkable product. Changing the architecture of a polymer from a linear to a multiarm or hyperbranched one, would change its chemical, diffusional and physical-mechanical properties. This review paper presents the current state and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization, properties and applications of the star-shaped resins made from lactic acid or lactide and multi-hydroxyl core molecules with a focus on the role of the architecture of the polymer on the properties of resins. Rheological, physiochemical and thermomechanical properties of to date synthesized star-shaped resins are compared and discussed. Special emphasis would be made on potential opportunities, probable applications and also gaps and drawbacks concerning these systems. This review aims to provide useful information to help future development of efficient, highly engineered bioresins which can be especially designed for certain applications.
