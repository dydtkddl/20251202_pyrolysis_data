You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Star-shaped lactic acid based systems and their thermosetting resins; synthesis, characterization, potential opportunities and drawbacks Shortcomings of the conventional PLA synthesis methods have encouraged researchers to investigate on alternative methods for PLA synthesis. Utilization of chain extenders is an effective way to achieve high MW polymers. The concept of using star-shaped resins as the reinforced matrices for biocomposites or in biomedical applications is gaining more and more attention day by day. Star-shaped lactic acid based resins are a class of branched resins with a multifunctional core molecule and lactic acid branches. In order to increase the reactivity of branches, the star-shaped resin oligomers can get end-functionalized which yields in a crosslinkable product. Changing the architecture of a polymer from a linear to a multiarm or hyperbranched one, would change its chemical, diffusional and physical-mechanical properties. This review paper presents the current state and recent advances in the synthesis, characterization, properties and applications of the star-shaped resins made from lactic acid or lactide and multi-hydroxyl core molecules with a focus on the role of the architecture of the polymer on the properties of resins. Rheological, physiochemical and thermomechanical properties of to date synthesized star-shaped resins are compared and discussed. Special emphasis would be made on potential opportunities, probable applications and also gaps and drawbacks concerning these systems. This review aims to provide useful information to help future development of efficient, highly engineered bioresins which can be especially designed for certain applications.
