You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on polyhydroxyalkanoate: Genetic engineering to enhance production and feedstocks assimilation as green alternative for Petrochemical plastics Microbial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are promising biopolymers due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability having the potential to be sustainable plastic alternatives for fossil-derived polymers. Carbon flow and energy metabolism divert towards central carbon metabolism, which limits PHA assimilation. Hence genetic engineering strategies target the strains specifically for enhanced PHA synthesis by up-regulating and knocking down operons, thus regulating the biochemical pathway. This review provides an in-depth understanding of genetics in PHA accumulation and briefly discusses its structural properties. C upriavidus necator is the pioneer bacteria for PHA production; others, such as Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp., avail themselves for the robust PHA production capabilities of genetically modified organisms. Genetic engineering techniques used for PHA production have been detailed and discussed like CRISPR based systems have also served as efficient genome editing tools to improve the efficiency of metabolic modification. The most promising methods to boost the yield were highlighted, along with the metabolic paradigms of PHA-producing bacteria and a summary of the range of inexpensive carbon substrates that are used. It also coveres how metabolic modification can support microbial cell factories that use various fermentation techniques and co-production systems to produce PHA using modified strains. Nevertheless, the high cost of production preventing PHA from being commercialised could be by-passed via., genetically modified strains or enriched Mixed Microbial Culture (MMC) as a cheaper option along with the solvent-free downstream processes appear to be a promising bioroute to lower PHA costs.
