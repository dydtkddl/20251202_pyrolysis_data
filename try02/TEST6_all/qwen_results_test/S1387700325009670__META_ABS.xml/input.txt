Critical review of metal-organic framework (MOF) in direct methanol fuel cells: Membrane and electrocatalyst performance enhancement Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have attracted increasing attention as a clean and portable energy solution for electronic devices, vehicles, and off-grid applications. However, their commercial viability remains limited due to key technical challenges, including methanol crossover through the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and sluggish kinetics of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. Recent advances in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer promising pathways to overcome these limitations. MOFs possess exceptional surface area, tunable porosity, and the ability to incorporate functional sites, making them attractive as both membrane fillers and electrocatalyst precursors. Despite a growing body of literature on MOFs in fuel cells, there remains a lack of focused reviews analyzing their dual role in DMFCs. This review critically examines the integration of MOFs into PEMs to reduce methanol permeability while enhancing proton conductivity, as well as their application as electrocatalysts to improve MOR activity and CO tolerance. A comparative analysis of recent MOF–polymer composite membranes and MOF-derived catalysts is presented, highlighting key performance indicators such as conductivity, selectivity, and power density. Finally, the paper outlines current research gaps and future directions for the rational design of multifunctional MOFs tailored for next-generation DMFCs. The insights from this review provide valuable guidance for researchers and industry stakeholders aiming to accelerate the development of commercially viable DMFC technologies.
