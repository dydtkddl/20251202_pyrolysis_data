You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Critical review of metal-organic framework (MOF) in direct methanol fuel cells: Membrane and electrocatalyst performance enhancement Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have attracted increasing attention as a clean and portable energy solution for electronic devices, vehicles, and off-grid applications. However, their commercial viability remains limited due to key technical challenges, including methanol crossover through the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and sluggish kinetics of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. Recent advances in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer promising pathways to overcome these limitations. MOFs possess exceptional surface area, tunable porosity, and the ability to incorporate functional sites, making them attractive as both membrane fillers and electrocatalyst precursors. Despite a growing body of literature on MOFs in fuel cells, there remains a lack of focused reviews analyzing their dual role in DMFCs. This review critically examines the integration of MOFs into PEMs to reduce methanol permeability while enhancing proton conductivity, as well as their application as electrocatalysts to improve MOR activity and CO tolerance. A comparative analysis of recent MOF–polymer composite membranes and MOF-derived catalysts is presented, highlighting key performance indicators such as conductivity, selectivity, and power density. Finally, the paper outlines current research gaps and future directions for the rational design of multifunctional MOFs tailored for next-generation DMFCs. The insights from this review provide valuable guidance for researchers and industry stakeholders aiming to accelerate the development of commercially viable DMFC technologies.
