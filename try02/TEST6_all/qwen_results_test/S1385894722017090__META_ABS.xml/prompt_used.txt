You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading of polyethylene to hydrocarbon fuels over the Fe-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalysts at a mild condition without external H2 Upcycling of waste plastic is an emerging topic in environmental chemical and process engineering. In this work, we investigated the pyrolysis of polyethylene (PE) over Fe-modified Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of external H2 to produce hydrocarbon fuels at a mild condition (330℃). The critical interest is to achieve the mild conversion of PE by using the bimetallic catalyst to generate in-situ H instead of external H2 for hydrogenolysis. Results show that a slight impregnation of Fe on Pt/Al2O3 (Fe/Pt = 0.25) can improve the oil yield and light oil selectivity as well as promote the formation of aromatics and alkenes in oil after PE pyrolysis in a batch reactor. Multiple active sites including Pt, Fe and Lewis acid site of Al2O3 work systematically to drive the tandem catalysis without H2. The Pt plays the major role in PE pyrolysis via hydrogenolysis assisted by in-situ generated H, but shows the mutual inhibition with the acid site of Al2O3 that is contributive to PE cracking via a traditional carbocation chemistry. Fe modification on Pt/Al2O3 plays multiple roles in catalysis: promotes cyclization reaction, benefits the hydrogenolysis activity of Pt by providing active H during aromatic formation, and decreases catalyst acidity to reduce gas production. However, an over-impregnation of Fe (Fe/Pt = 1) partially covers the Pt sites, resulting in the decrease of fuel oil production but an increase in residue yield due to the deactivation of Pt sites. The post-reaction catalyst can be almost completely regenerated after combustion and reduction.
