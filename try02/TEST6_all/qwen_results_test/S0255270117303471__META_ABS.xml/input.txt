Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a microchannel reactor using mesoporous silica supported bimetallic Co-Ni catalyst: Process optimization and kinetic modeling Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis was carried out in a microchannel reactor under a wide range of operating conditions (e.g. 280–320°C, 10–50bar, H2/CO 1–3) using a mesoporous supported bimetallic Co-Ni catalyst. The response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were employed in determining the optimal condition for light olefin production. Three key operational parameters (e.g. syngas ratio, operational pressure, and reaction temperature) were chosen as independent variables in CCD. A new comprehensive kinetic model assuming separate rate of C1, C2, C3 and Cn (n ≥4) by coupling Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) carbide mechanistic approach together with thermodynamic correction is capable of representing olefin-to-paraffin ratio (O/P ratio) and product distribution at experimental conditions in this microchannel reactor.
