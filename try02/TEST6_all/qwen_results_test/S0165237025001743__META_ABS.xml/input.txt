Unveiling the potential of thermo catalytic fast pyrolysis for the production of higher quantities of bio-oil: Lignin-derived oxygenates Optimally loaded SrO (10 %) by weight on H-ZSM-5 for catalytic fixed bed downstream fast pyrolysis of lignin is further investigated. The effect of reaction temperature ranging from 450°C to 750°C on lignin was examined and optimized at 550°C with a nitrogen gas flow of 0.5 liters per minute. Purified lignin to catalyst ratio as 25:5 (wt/wt) afforded a maximum 34.2 wt% bio-oil yield. It is compared with the bio-oil obtained without a catalyst based on percentage yield, product distribution, and quality. The metal oxide showed significant changes in the acidic properties of H-ZSM-5. All original characteristics, respectively, pore volume 0.0836 cm3g−1, surface area 253.039 m2g−1, and pore radius 1.62501 nm of H-ZSM-5 showed a decrease on further increase in metal beyond 10 %. The reaction temperature of pyrolysis over 550°C reduces the yield of bio-oil. ESI-MS of bio-oil obtained using a catalyst indicates an overall shift towards the low molecular weight compounds, decreased PDI, and relatively lesser oligomers studied up to 320 m/z ratio. Base sites of SrO promote the transformation of carboxylic acids into ketones, supporting the loss of oxygen. The role of the acidic site of H-ZSM-5 and base sites of SrO contribute to converting oxygenated compounds to phenols, including esters, acids, alcohols, and phenols hydrocarbons. Typically, hydroxy-acids, hydroxy-esters, etc, showed marked resistance to chemical transformation. In comparison, analysis of pyrolysis gas under optimized conditions shows a 2 % higher hydrogen content by volume. Although under slightly altered conditions, catalyst reuse is demonstrated with a fair response.
