You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on upcycling of food waste into value added products towards a circular economy: Holistic approaches and life cycle assessments Background Food waste (FW) generation is a global issue that affects the environment, society, and economy. The conventional methods of FW management lead to the generation of toxic leachate and greenhouse gases, high energy consumptions, and the lack of high-value products development. Therefore, more sustainable approaches to FW treatment are needed. The discarded FW is a valuable feedstock for biobased conversions owing to its carbon content and nutrients. Therefore, in addition to producing bioenergy, efforts have been made to convert FW into bioproducts with high economic value. Scope and approach This review aims to explore various approaches for effectively utilising FW, including various FW types, different strategies, and value-added products generated under various circumstances. Furthermore, techno-economic assessment and life cycle studies of FW management are discussed. Key findings and conclusions It is anticipated that FW conversion will become more sophisticated in the near future to generate a broad spectrum of biobased products. This will be accomplished through obtaining a better understanding of FW valorisation methods with a focus on the potential uses. In addition to the reduction of FW produced, bio-based products generation offers a safer alternative to synthetic substances that are hazardous to the ecosystem and human health.
