A comprehensive review on upcycling of food waste into value added products towards a circular economy: Holistic approaches and life cycle assessments Background Food waste (FW) generation is a global issue that affects the environment, society, and economy. The conventional methods of FW management lead to the generation of toxic leachate and greenhouse gases, high energy consumptions, and the lack of high-value products development. Therefore, more sustainable approaches to FW treatment are needed. The discarded FW is a valuable feedstock for biobased conversions owing to its carbon content and nutrients. Therefore, in addition to producing bioenergy, efforts have been made to convert FW into bioproducts with high economic value. Scope and approach This review aims to explore various approaches for effectively utilising FW, including various FW types, different strategies, and value-added products generated under various circumstances. Furthermore, techno-economic assessment and life cycle studies of FW management are discussed. Key findings and conclusions It is anticipated that FW conversion will become more sophisticated in the near future to generate a broad spectrum of biobased products. This will be accomplished through obtaining a better understanding of FW valorisation methods with a focus on the potential uses. In addition to the reduction of FW produced, bio-based products generation offers a safer alternative to synthetic substances that are hazardous to the ecosystem and human health.
