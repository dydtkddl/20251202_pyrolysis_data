You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in thermochemical techniques to produce hydrogen gas from biomass: A state of the art review The present work comprehensively covers the literature that describes the thermochemical techniques of hydrogen production from biomass. This survey highlights the current approaches, relevant methods, technologies and resources adopted for high yield hydrogen production. Prominent thermochemical methods i.e. pyrolysis, gasification, supercritical water gasification, hydrothermal upgrading followed by steam gasification, bio-oil reforming, and pyrolysis inline reforming have been discussed thoroughly in view of the current research trend and latest emerging technologies. Influences of important factors and parameters on hydrogen yield, such as biomass type, temperature, steam to biomass ratio, retention time, biomass particle size, heating rate, etc. have also been extensively studied. Catalyst is a vital integrant that has received enough attention due to its encouraging influence on hydrogen production. Literature confirms that hydrogen obtained from biomass has high-energy efficiency and potential to reduce greenhouse gases hence, it deserves versatile applications in the coming future. The study also reveals that hydrogen production through steam reforming, pyrolysis, and in-line reforming deliver a considerable amount of hydrogen from biomass with higher process efficiency. It has been identified that higher temperature, suitable steam to biomass ratio and catalyst type favor useful hydrogen yield. Nevertheless, hydrogen is not readily available in the sufficient amount and production cost is still high. Tar generation during thermochemical processing of biomass is also a concern and requires consistent efforts to minimize it.
