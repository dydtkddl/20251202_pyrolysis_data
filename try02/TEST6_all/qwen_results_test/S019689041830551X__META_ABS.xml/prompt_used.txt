You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On a carbon-negative energy production scheme via a quadruple fluidized bed gasifier To restrain the CO2 concentration in atmosphere, deployment of the carbon-negative energy generation devices is indispensable on account of the vast net carbon discharge every year. In this work, a novel and promising quadruple fluidized bed (QFB) reactor for the biomass/coal co-gasification is proposed to generate the high-quality syngas whilst separate CO2 for further sequestration or utilization. To reveal the fundamental rules governing the reactor, a one dimensional model coupling the gas-solid flow hydrodynamics and the chemical reaction kinetics is built to simulate the physicochemical processes in the QFB, and the effects of several pivotal operation parameters on the reactor performance are comprehensively analyzed. It is found that the QFB runs stably under the given condition. The H2 mole fraction in the dry syngas is higher than 70%, the CO2 mole fraction in the dry flue gas is around 97%, and the net carbon discharge can be negative when the biomass blending ratio is over 0.5. The methodology and findings in this work are of reference value for the lab, pilot or industrial scale QFB designation and operation, and can be extended to develop similar novel reactors for the carbon-negative energy generation.
