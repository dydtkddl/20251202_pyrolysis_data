You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical H2 generation for sustainable future: Performance improvement, techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment for shaping the reality Photocatalytic (PC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce H2 as clean fuel utilizing renewable solar irradiation offers an excellent opportunity to address the global energy crisis and reduce carbon emissions. For improving the solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiencies, modifying the material characteristic with dye sensitization, co-catalyst doping, engineered nano-structuring, formulating heterojunction and Z-schemes, and different sacrificial agents are used, resulting in higher H2 efficiencies than the unmodified ones. In the last decade, the growing interest in developing and improving soft polymeric photocatalysts (carbon nitrides, linear π conjugated polymers, CMP, COF, etc.) and plasmonic photocatalysts have also emerged significantly. However, for the industrial scale-up and reducing the cost of renewable H2, efficient photo-reactor design with integrated separation, collection, and storage facilities are more crucial with the Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the proposed production schemes. This article is focused on bridging the gaps to upscale the lab-scale research in PC/PEC water splitting to industrial scale by extensively reviewing the existing photo-reactor design, process integration, process scale-up, TEA, and LCA. With this, the recent advances and approaches in modifying photocatalytic materials are reviewed starting with the mechanism, nature, and properties of the PC and PEC H2 generation. Thus, this article will provide a complete overview of the solar-based photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical H2 generation, technical barriers to implementation on a large scale with the current trends and solutions, with a few potential directions for future research, development, and deployment.
