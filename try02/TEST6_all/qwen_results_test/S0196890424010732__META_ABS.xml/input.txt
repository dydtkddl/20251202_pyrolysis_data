Thermodynamic and exergo-economic evaluation of biomass-to-X system combined the chemical looping gasification and proton exchange membrane fuel cell The resource utilization of biomass is of great significance to the adjustment of energy structure. The syngas produced by biomass gasification can be used for power generation and production of green chemical raw materials. In this paper, a biomass-to-X (BtX) system based on the chemical looping gasification and high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is proposed to produce methanol, electricity, heating and cooling. The heat produced by the BtX system is harnessed for the regeneration of the carbon capture solution, as well as to drive both the organic Rankine cycle and the double-effect absorption chiller, enabling cascade utilization of the energy. The thermodynamic and exergo-economic models are carried out to evaluate system performance. The relationship between the material, energy and cost flow from biomass to products is analyzed. Finally, the influence of key parameters on system performance is studied. The results show that the energy efficiency of the BtX system is 54.0 % and the exergy efficiency is 35.4 %. The yield rate of methanol with 99.2 wt% purity is 6.48 tons/h. The cost of equipment, propanol and biomass accounts for 34.9 %, 28.9 % and 28.1 % of the total investment cost, respectively, while the cost of the PEMFC stack represents 50.4 % of the equipment costs. The unit exergy cost of the electricity and methanol are 0.068 $/kWh and 0.049 $/kWh, respectively. The methanol, carbon capture and cooling costs are most sensitive to the change in the propanol cost, followed by the biomass cost. For every 0.05 increase in the hydrogen fraction to methanol production, the electricity decreases by 3.1 MW and the methanol yield increases by 0.23 kg/s.
