You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic and exergo-economic evaluation of biomass-to-X system combined the chemical looping gasification and proton exchange membrane fuel cell The resource utilization of biomass is of great significance to the adjustment of energy structure. The syngas produced by biomass gasification can be used for power generation and production of green chemical raw materials. In this paper, a biomass-to-X (BtX) system based on the chemical looping gasification and high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is proposed to produce methanol, electricity, heating and cooling. The heat produced by the BtX system is harnessed for the regeneration of the carbon capture solution, as well as to drive both the organic Rankine cycle and the double-effect absorption chiller, enabling cascade utilization of the energy. The thermodynamic and exergo-economic models are carried out to evaluate system performance. The relationship between the material, energy and cost flow from biomass to products is analyzed. Finally, the influence of key parameters on system performance is studied. The results show that the energy efficiency of the BtX system is 54.0 % and the exergy efficiency is 35.4 %. The yield rate of methanol with 99.2 wt% purity is 6.48 tons/h. The cost of equipment, propanol and biomass accounts for 34.9 %, 28.9 % and 28.1 % of the total investment cost, respectively, while the cost of the PEMFC stack represents 50.4 % of the equipment costs. The unit exergy cost of the electricity and methanol are 0.068 $/kWh and 0.049 $/kWh, respectively. The methanol, carbon capture and cooling costs are most sensitive to the change in the propanol cost, followed by the biomass cost. For every 0.05 increase in the hydrogen fraction to methanol production, the electricity decreases by 3.1 MW and the methanol yield increases by 0.23 kg/s.
