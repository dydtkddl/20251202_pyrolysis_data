A review on sustainable valorization of pulp and paper sludge for energy and material applications The pulp and paper industry, one of the oldest and most vital sectors in the global economy, encounters a notable environmental challenge as the mill's wastewater generates large quantities of sludge. Limited land, high costs, public concerns, complex laws, and ecological demands restricted traditional sludge disposal methods like landfilling and incineration. Converting industrial sludge into valuable products promotes recycling and reuse and provides a sustainable alternative. Pulp and Paper Mill Sludge (PPMS) can be recycled into value-added products by utilizing several thermochemical and biological processes to synthesize biofuel, biochar, adsorbents, and activated carbon. This review article aims to provide an overview of the environmental impact of this industry's sludge and how technologies, methods, and management systems have evolved to convert this burden into an asset for both the environment and the industry. Additionally, PPMS can be recycled by incorporating it into cardboard, nanocomposites, and building materials, and it has garnered interest in producing quantum dots. Furthermore, the paper explores the latest biotechnological advancements to valorize PPMS and create valuable products, including cellulose, nanocellulose, lactic acid, and biofuels. This review discusses the synthesis of various valorization processes and their pros and cons and acts as a guide for upcoming studies on efficient PPMS management.
