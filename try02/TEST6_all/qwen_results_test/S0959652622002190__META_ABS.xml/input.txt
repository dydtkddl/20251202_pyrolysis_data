Evaluating performance of pyrolysis and gasification processes of agriculture residues-derived hydrochar: Effect of hydrothermal carbonization In this study, corn straw and rice husk were hydrothermally carbonized at 180 °C and 240 °C. The effect of hydrothermal carbonization on the biomass/hydrochar characteristics, fate of heavy metals such as As, Cr, Pb, Ti, Cd, Zn, Fe, Cu, and Ni, global reactivity of the pyrolysis and gasification of biomass and hydrochar were investigated in a thermogravimetric analyzer, followed by kinetic modeling and reactivity prediction. Results showed that hydrothermal carbonization temperature 180 °C is more suitable for producing solid fuel in terms of low heavy metals content. Higher hydrothermal carbonization temperature (240 °C) decreased O/C content and improved various characteristics of the hydrochar such as coalification degree, carbon content, higher heating value and the specific surface area. While hydrothermal carbonization conducted at lower temperature of 180 °C, was advantageous for obtaining higher energy yield efficiency and hydrochar yield. The gasification reactivity of hydrochar was more sensitive to the heating rate than the pyrolysis process. The activation energy (Ea) of the pyrolysis process varied significantly with conversion, whereas the gasification activation energy changes were insignificant. Based on the reactivity prediction, the hydrothermal carbonization effect on corn straw and rice husk was almost similar. The hydrochar generated under severe hydrothermal carbonization temperature (240 °C) showed higher thermal stability during pyrolysis in comparison with gasification. Compared with the gasification of rice husk hydrochar, hydrochar gasification of corn straw had lower Ea, hence requires less energy to produce syngas. The results of this research imply that biomass hydrochar is a suitable alternative option to produce pulverized solid fuel.
