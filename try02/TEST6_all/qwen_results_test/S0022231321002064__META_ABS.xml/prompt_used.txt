You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis, structure and spectroscopy of Fe2+:MgAl2O4 transparent ceramics and glass-ceramics We report on a comparative study of a transparent Fe:MgAl2O4 (spinel) ceramics and a transparent nanophase Fe:MgAl2O4-based glass-ceramics. The 0.1 mol% Fe:MgAl2O4 ceramics was synthesized by hot pressing (at 1500 °C/50 MPa) of powders obtained by the sol-gel method using LiF as a sintering aid. The Fe:MgAl2O4 ceramic is a single-phase material (cubic structure, sp. gr. Fd3‾m, a = 8.083 Å) with a mean grain size of ~50 μm. The ceramic exhibits a broadband transparency of 0.2–6.0 μm and a high in-line transmission at ~1 μm of 74.4%. The iron ions are presented in the ceramics in the single state of Fe2+ species in tetrahedral (Td) sites. A broad absorption band spanning from ~1.2 to 3.7 μm assigned to the 5E → 5T2 (5D) transition of Fe2+ ions in Td sites is observed, corresponding to a ground-state absorption cross section of 0.28 × 10−18 cm2 at 1.90 μm. The glass-ceramics were prepared by secondary two-stage heat-treatments of the magnesium aluminosilicate glass nucleated by titanium oxide and doped with 0.1 mol% FeO. Transparent Fe:MgAl2O4-based glass-ceramics obtained at the temperature of the second stage of 800–1000 °C were multi-phase materials containing two crystalline nanophases, i.e., spinel (mean size: 3.7–7.4 nm) and magnesium aluminotitanate solid solution (mean size: 6.4–20.6 nm), as well as residual silica-rich glass. Glass-ceramics obtained at the temperature of the second stage of 1050 °C were transparent and based on Fe-doped sapphirine. For glass-ceramics, absorption has a much more complex character as it is caused by interplay of iron and titanium ions in different valence states, coordination sites and locations. The iron ions enter the spinel nanocrystals but unlike the ceramic, in the form of both VIFe2+ and IVFe2+ species. The developed ceramics and glass-ceramics are promising for saturable absorbers of mid-infrared (2–3 μm) lasers.
