You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Incorporating hydrothermal liquefaction into wastewater treatment – Part II: Characterization, environmental impacts, and potential applications of hydrochar Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technique for renewable biofuel (biocrude) production from municipal sludge. However, its solid byproduct, hydrochar, requires sustainable management for further resource recovery and pollution control. This study comprehensively assessed the properties, environmental influences, and possible utilizations of hydrochar generated from mixed sludge (MS). With the increase of HTL reaction temperatures (290–360 °C) and residence time (0–30 min), the dry-weight contents of ash and fuel ratio increased from 10.5% and 0.1 in MS to 48.7–68.5% and 0.4–0.7 in hydrochar, respectively. However, the dry-basis contents of volatile matter, carbon, and higher heating value sharply decreased to 18.7–35.9%, 22.9–37.3%, and 8.6–16.0 MJ/kg, respectively. The leaching risks of inorganic contaminants from hydrochar were limited and controllable in various scenarios. Hydrochar performed more stable combustion than sludge, but its high ash contents and alkali index (0.28–0.72 kg/GJ) implied high risks of slagging and fouling. Hydrochar has a good potential for carbon sequestration due to low O/C ratios (<0.2) and improved recalcitrance index (0.43–0.48). Benefiting from intrinsic metals (e.g., Ca and Fe), catalytic hydrochar graphitization was feasible at a moderate temperature (1200 °C). Although hydrochar was restricted from land application for heavy metals accumulation, it is promising for metals and nutrient recovery. It has a total phosphorus (P) of 7.2–8.5% by weight, and thus P recovery is critical and necessary for mitigating environmental challenges and global P scarcity. Overall, this study contributed to the state-of-the-art in waste-to-resource development and cleaner production.
