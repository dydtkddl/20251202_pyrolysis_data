You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon from microwave assisted pyrolysis of waste tires A correlation between experimental conditions of microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of tires and some of the characteristics of char are reported. MAP is a complementary or even an alternative methodology to recycle waste polymeric materials. This appealing way was employed in managing waste tires since they contain a high amount of microwave absorbing materials such as metal wires, metal oxides, and carbon, which quickly adsorb microwave radiation (MW) and turn it into heat. Char obtained from MAP of tire was characterized through chemical (ultimate analysis and ion coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy), morphological (BET surface area, scanning electron microscopy), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. MAP variables such as MW power and tire mass, did not strongly affect the properties of samples. Char contained large amount of amorphous carbon and inorganic compounds formed from additives employed in tires formulation. Hydrocarbons were present only in not-fully pyrolyzed samples. XRD analyses of crystalline phases showed a marked MW effect: different crystalline ZnS forms, spharelite or wurtzite were present due to the different amount of waste tires employed. The presence of these compounds suggested that tires were heated to a temperature higher than the usually accounted.
