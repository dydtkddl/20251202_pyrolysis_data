You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal decomposition of polyolefin/carbon black composites The thermal decomposition of carbon black composites with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyisobutylene (PIB) has been studied in order to clarify the influence of carbon black on the thermal behavior of polymers in inert atmosphere. The thermal stability of the composites and mixtures has been monitored by thermogravimetry, whereas the decomposition product distribution of the composites has been determined by pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Using various types of carbon blacks, it has been established that the effect depends on the volatile content of the carbon blacks. Carbon black of high volatile content is able to initiate the decomposition of PP and PIB, whereas carbon blacks of low volatile content increase the thermal stability of the polymers. Carbon blacks affect the product distribution of polymers, the magnitude of the changes increases with increasing volatile content of the carbon black. Lower amount of α,ω-alkadienes and more n-alkanes are released from PE/carbon black composite indicating the occurrence of a hydrogenation process. The intensity of the 1-alkene oligomers of PP is reduced, while several other products are formed during thermal decomposition of PP/carbon black composites. The product distribution indicates that carbon black participates in the hydrogen transfer reactions. Enhanced monomer evolution and hindered oligomer formation are observed in PIB that can be explained by a chain end initiation reaction in the presence of carbon black.
