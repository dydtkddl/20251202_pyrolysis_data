Catalytic chemical recycling and upcycling of polyolefin plastics Polyolefins are the most produced and widely used polymeric materials. However, the chemically inert nature of polyolefins has led to severe environmental pollution, posing a threat to human sustenance and development. Managing and recycling polyolefin plastic waste is crucial for the transition from a linear to a sustainable circular economy. Catalytic chemical recycling includes traditional techniques like pyrolysis and photolysis, and innovative methods that introduce chemical cleavable bonds into the polyolefin chain for closed-loop recycling. Catalytic post-functionalization of post-consumer polyolefin materials is another strategy to tackle plastic waste, aiming to upgrade the materials’ utility and contribute to sustainability. Overall, developing catalytic methods for deconstructing and upcycling plastics is essential to encourage better reclamation practices and reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste.
