Pickering emulsions stabilized by metal-organic framework nanoparticles Pickering emulsions are attractive formulations due to their simplicity, similar to traditional surfactant-based emulsions, and their potential to create functional materials. Recently, Pickering emulsions stabilized by metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles have garnered significant interest. This Review aims to systematize our knowledge of how MOF nanoparticles stabilize Pickering emulsions, providing fundamental insights for advancing this field. We thoroughly examine the emulsification process of Pickering emulsions stabilized by MOF nanoparticles. Additionally, we detail the superstructures derived from these emulsions, including colloidosomes, hydrogel droplets, 3D honeycomb network structures, molecularly imprinted polymers, monoliths, and micromotors. Finally, we discuss challenges and future research opportunities related to this type of emulsion.
