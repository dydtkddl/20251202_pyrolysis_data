You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molten waste plastic pyrolysis in a vertical falling film reactor and the influence of temperature on the pyrolysis products Molten plastics are characterised with high viscosity and low thermal conductivity. Applying falling film pyrolysis reactor to deal with waste plastics can not only improve heat transfer efficiency, but also solve the flow problem. In this work, the pyrolysis process of molten polypropylene (PP) in a vertical falling film reactor is experimentally studied, and the influence of heating temperature on pyrolysis products is discussed. It has been found that with the temperature increases from 550°C to 625°C, the yield of pyrolysis oil decreases from 74.4wt% (±2.2wt%) to 53.5wt% (±1.3wt%). The major compositions of the pyrolysis oil are C9, C12 and C18, and β-scission reactions are predominant. The content of the light fraction C6–C12 of pyrolysis oil is 69.7wt%. Compared with other pyrolysis reactors, the yield of oil from vertical falling film pyrolysis reactor is slightly higher than that from tubular reactor, equal to that from rotary kiln reactor, and slightly lower than that in medium fluidised-bed reactor.
