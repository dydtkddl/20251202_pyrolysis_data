You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal treatment of Cs-exchanged chabazite by hot isostatic pressing to support decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Ion exchange materials are used widely for the removal of radionuclides from contaminated water at nuclear licensed sites, during normal operating procedures, decommissioning and in accident clean-up, such as the ongoing recovery operation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Framework silicate inorganic ion exchange materials, such as chabazite ((Na0.14K1.03Ca1.00Mg0.17)[Al3.36Si8.53O24]•9.7H2O), have shown particular selectivity towards 137Cs uptake, but their safe storage poses a number challenges requiring conditioning into passively safe waste packages of minimal volume. We demonstrate the transformation of Cs-exchanged chabazite into a glass-ceramic wasteform by hot isostatic pressing to produce a durable consolidated monolith. The application of heat and pressure resulted in the collapse of the chabazite framework, forming crystalline Cs-substituted leucite (Cs0.15(3)K0.57(4)Al0.90(4)Si2.24(5)O6) incorporated within a K2O-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass. The Cs partitioned preferentially into the Cs/K-feldspar which incorporated ~77% of the Cs2O inventory. Analysis of the chemical durability of the glass-ceramic wasteform revealed that the Cs release rates were comparable or lower than those reported for vitrified high level and intermediate level wastes. Overall, hot isostatic pressing was demonstrated to be an effective processing technology for conditioning spent inorganic ion exchange materials by yielding durable and passively safe wasteforms.
