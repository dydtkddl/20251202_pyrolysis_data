You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Car and truck tire wear particles in complex environmental samples – A quantitative comparison with “traditional” microplastic polymer mass loads Tire wear particles (TWP) are assumed to be the most dominant source of environmental microplastics (MP). Besides rubber components around 60% of tires are additives such as filling material and various chemicals added for vulcanization. The inevitably released TWP in daily traffic are therefore considered a threat to the ecosystem. Nevertheless, published studies on MP mass loads often exclude elastomers. Data concerning composition and concentrations of TWP compared to prominent “traditional” MP polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly(vinyl chloride), are missing. Identification and quantification of TWP was implemented in an existing pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) method for MP determination. An approach to differentiate between car and truck tire wear and to quantify their respective mass loads is presented. Complex environmental samples such as road dust, fresh water and marine sediments, blue mussels, and marine salts were partly retrospectively analyzed using Py-GC/MS. The results showed ratios of car to truck tire wear up to 16 to 1 and underline the dominance of car compared to truck tire wear mass loads in all analyzed samples. Even though some retrospective data sets might be affected by suboptimal density separation conditions (NaBr, ρ = 1.5 g/cm3), TWP concentrations in road dust clearly exceeded those of “traditional” MP (Ø 5 g TWP vs 0.3 g MP per kg road dust (dry weight). Samples included in this study, which were archived further away from TWP sources such as roads, reflected decreasing TWP concentrations (Ø 24 μg TWP vs. 107 μg MP per kg sediment (dry weight); Ø 126 μg TWP vs. 378 μg MP per kg marine salt) or were no longer present (blue mussels), while “traditional” polymers were still ubiquitously distributed.
