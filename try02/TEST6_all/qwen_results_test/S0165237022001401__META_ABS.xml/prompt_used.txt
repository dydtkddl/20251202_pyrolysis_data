You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of textile fibers by means of EGA-MS and Py-GC/MS Textile fibers have represented an important resource for mankind throughout all human history. In fact, ancient cultures employed them not just to produce clothes, but also for expressing their habits and traditions. Based on the chemical composition, textile fibers are classified as natural, artificial, and synthetic. The analysis of textile fibers can be very challenging, so it is crucial to find new analytical tools capable of identifying them and studying their behavior in the environment. The collected information can be transferred in many different fields, such as the industrial sector, forensic science, environmental science, and heritage science. In the present study, the capability of Pyrolysis coupled to Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and Evolved Gas Analysis coupled to Mass Spectrometry (EGA-MS) to discriminate textile fibers was tested. The first part of the study was addressed to the analysis of pure samples to build a detailed database by highlighting the main differences in the chromatographic profiles. Then, three textile blends of known composition were investigated, and the results compared with those acquired by Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Eventually, the information obtained from the reference materials was exploited for the study of textile samples collected from the stage costumes of the lyrical opera ‘I Puritani’ directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1961. The EGA-MS and Py-GC/MS results, integrated with those obtained by optical microscopy, allowed us to deepen the characterization of the historical samples.
