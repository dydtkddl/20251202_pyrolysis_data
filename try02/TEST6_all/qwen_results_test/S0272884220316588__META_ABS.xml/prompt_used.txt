You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced sonocatalytic degradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants using a magnetically recoverable Ag/Fe-loaded activated biochar composite Silverorthophosphate (Ag3PO4)-iron oxide (Fe3O4)@activated biochar (AB) composite was prepared by a co-precipitation method as a sonocatalyst for the degradation of recalcitrant organic contaminants. We characterized Ag3PO4–Fe3O4@AB to study the physicochemical properties using scanning electron microscopy, porosimetry, a vibrating sample magnetometer, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The specific surface area increased after loading Ag3PO4–Fe3O4 on AB compared to AB only. The high magnetic property of Ag3PO4–Fe3O4@AB was confirmed by vibrating sample magnetometer analysis, which could be attributed to the existence of Fe3O4. The Ag3PO4–Fe3O4@AB demonstrated excellent sonocatalytic performances for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and bisphenol A (BPA) under an ultrasonic (US) irradiation. Synergetic sonocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4–Fe3O4@AB has been obtained from (i) enhanced pyrolysis conditions of water molecules on the surface of the sonocatalyst through a “hot spot” and (ii) photoinduced separation between electron-hole pairs of Ag3PO4 using sonoluminescence. The predominant active radical species was OH•, which was confirmed by a spin trapping study. The US/Ag3PO4–Fe3O4@AB system demonstrated successful application in the degradation of various organic contaminants including synthetic dyes, endocrine-disrupting compounds/pharmaceutical active chemicals, and chlorinated organic contaminants as well as excellent reusability without a significant loss of sonocatalytic performance.
