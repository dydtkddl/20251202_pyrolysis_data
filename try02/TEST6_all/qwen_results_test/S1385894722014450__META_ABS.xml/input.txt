Highly efficient activation of persulfate by encapsulated nano-Fe0 biochar for acetaminophen degradation: Rich electron environment and dominant effect of superoxide radical In this study, an encapsulated nanoscale zero-valent iron biochar (BC-Fe0) derived from waste lignocellulose rice straw (RS) was synthesized. BC-Fe0 has excellent properties, including long-term stability, a large specific surface area, many micropore structures, active defects active and oxygen-containing groups. The material was first used to activate persulfate (PDS), showing a highly efficient catalysis for acetaminophen (ACT) degradation. The removal efficiency of ACT within 20 min reached 100%, and the degradation rate constant (k obs) reached 0.37475 min−1 at the ACT concentration of 10 mg/L, BC-Fe0 of 0.5 g/L, temperature of 298 K. EPR demonstrated that ·OH, SO4 −·, ·O2 − and 1O2 occurred during the reaction process, and ·O2 −, 1O2 and electron transfer played major roles in PDS/BC-Fe0 system. Fe0 nanoparticles promoted the activation of PDS to generate ·O2 −, which induced a series of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to attack ACT. C = O might also contribute to the production of 1O2. In addition, graphitic carbon, C–O, defects and micropores on BC-Fe0 together created a rich electron environment, which is conducive to the redox reaction between ACT and ROS. Satisfyingly, BC-Fe0 not only had a high catalytic activation capacity, but also exhibited a desirable durability and recyclability. The development of BC-Fe0 catalysts and the study of PDS activation for organic pollutant degradation are significant to biomass conversion and advanced oxidation processes in environmental remediation.
