You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient activation of persulfate by encapsulated nano-Fe0 biochar for acetaminophen degradation: Rich electron environment and dominant effect of superoxide radical In this study, an encapsulated nanoscale zero-valent iron biochar (BC-Fe0) derived from waste lignocellulose rice straw (RS) was synthesized. BC-Fe0 has excellent properties, including long-term stability, a large specific surface area, many micropore structures, active defects active and oxygen-containing groups. The material was first used to activate persulfate (PDS), showing a highly efficient catalysis for acetaminophen (ACT) degradation. The removal efficiency of ACT within 20 min reached 100%, and the degradation rate constant (k obs) reached 0.37475 min−1 at the ACT concentration of 10 mg/L, BC-Fe0 of 0.5 g/L, temperature of 298 K. EPR demonstrated that ·OH, SO4 −·, ·O2 − and 1O2 occurred during the reaction process, and ·O2 −, 1O2 and electron transfer played major roles in PDS/BC-Fe0 system. Fe0 nanoparticles promoted the activation of PDS to generate ·O2 −, which induced a series of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to attack ACT. C = O might also contribute to the production of 1O2. In addition, graphitic carbon, C–O, defects and micropores on BC-Fe0 together created a rich electron environment, which is conducive to the redox reaction between ACT and ROS. Satisfyingly, BC-Fe0 not only had a high catalytic activation capacity, but also exhibited a desirable durability and recyclability. The development of BC-Fe0 catalysts and the study of PDS activation for organic pollutant degradation are significant to biomass conversion and advanced oxidation processes in environmental remediation.
