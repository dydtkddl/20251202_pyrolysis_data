Design of a set of habitat units and the corresponding surrounding cluster for long-term scientific missions in the pre-terraforming era on Mars We are living in a point in the history of science and technology, where space travel for research and settlement is inevitable. As the utmost crucial technology pieces for leaving Earth and travelling into the cosmos is being established one after another, it is just a matter of decades, until it all gets integrated together, solving the engineering problems ahead of the way and being able to step on the planets and moons of the solar system. In this quest, as has been the case for most of the technological advancements so far, there ought to be mind experiments, in which one skips one step, assumes the availability of responses to the skipped-over step, and searches for the solution to the questions of the next level. This way, by getting passed the first, i.e. current step, the solution to the next one is already available. The current manuscript is addressing this very ‘next step’, on the long path to eventually colonize Mars and inhabit it for long-term research-based missions; let it be for terraforming, or other agenda to be defined by the research strategists, then. And as mentioned earlier, the current step; being setting foot on Mars, is well-deservedly taken for granted, as is to come forth undoubtedly. Having that realized, we might find ourselves faced by the engineering complexities of surviving and thriving on Mars, which is the subject matter of the current research, from the aspect point of space technological and architectural design. The design procedure beginning from setting the philosophy of design upon the concerns of sustaining in the hostile environment of Mars, to the stepwise emergence of the final design of a cluster of Martian Habitat Units (MHUs) considering the high-criteria of the case, is the subject matter covered in this manuscript.
