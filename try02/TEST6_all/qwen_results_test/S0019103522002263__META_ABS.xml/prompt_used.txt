You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design of a set of habitat units and the corresponding surrounding cluster for long-term scientific missions in the pre-terraforming era on Mars We are living in a point in the history of science and technology, where space travel for research and settlement is inevitable. As the utmost crucial technology pieces for leaving Earth and travelling into the cosmos is being established one after another, it is just a matter of decades, until it all gets integrated together, solving the engineering problems ahead of the way and being able to step on the planets and moons of the solar system. In this quest, as has been the case for most of the technological advancements so far, there ought to be mind experiments, in which one skips one step, assumes the availability of responses to the skipped-over step, and searches for the solution to the questions of the next level. This way, by getting passed the first, i.e. current step, the solution to the next one is already available. The current manuscript is addressing this very ‘next step’, on the long path to eventually colonize Mars and inhabit it for long-term research-based missions; let it be for terraforming, or other agenda to be defined by the research strategists, then. And as mentioned earlier, the current step; being setting foot on Mars, is well-deservedly taken for granted, as is to come forth undoubtedly. Having that realized, we might find ourselves faced by the engineering complexities of surviving and thriving on Mars, which is the subject matter of the current research, from the aspect point of space technological and architectural design. The design procedure beginning from setting the philosophy of design upon the concerns of sustaining in the hostile environment of Mars, to the stepwise emergence of the final design of a cluster of Martian Habitat Units (MHUs) considering the high-criteria of the case, is the subject matter covered in this manuscript.
