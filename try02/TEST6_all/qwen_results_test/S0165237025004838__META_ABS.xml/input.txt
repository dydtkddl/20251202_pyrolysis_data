Co-pyrolysis for dual benefits: Enhanced oil quality from waste tires/plastics and detoxification of chromium slag Waste chromium slag (WCs) optimized the pyrolysis behavior and product distribution of waste tires (WTs)/waste plastics (WPs) through catalysis. Concurrently, WCs were efficiently reduced and detoxified by the pyrolysis volatiles, establishing a synergistic co-treatment mechanism for toxic and waste materials. This study employed thermogravimetric-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR), pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and tube furnace pyrolysis experiments for multi-dimensional analysis. Results revealed that WCs introduction lowered the initial pyrolysis temperature, inhibited chlorine-containing functional groups (H-Cl and C-Cl) formation, and enhanced liquid-phase product yield. Most notably, WCs exhibited pronounced catalytic cracking effects, promoting selective enrichment of light components (C5-C12), with their proportion increasing from 27.6 % to 51.9 %. Meanwhile, sulfur and chlorine elements in WTs and WPs underwent targeted migration during pyrolysis, partly were adsorbed by solid phase residues. Consequently, sulfur content reduced from 39.4 % to 24.6 %, and chlorine content from 2.7 % to 1.0 % in liquid products. Additionally, WTs, WPs, and their mixtures (WTs/WPs) all demonstrated excellent reduction efficiency for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), with rates reaching 94.0 % under optimal conditions. This work clarifies the catalytic function of WCs in pyrolysis systems, providing innovative technical pathways for high-value resource utilization of WTs/WPs and harmless synergistic treatment of WCs.
