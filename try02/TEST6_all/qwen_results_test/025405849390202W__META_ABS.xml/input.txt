Carbon-mineral adsorbents — new type of sorbents part II. Surface properties and methods of their modification Chemical structure and morphology of carbon deposits contained in complex carbon-mineral adsorbents prepared by pyrolysis of different substances on the surface of mineral adsorbents such as silica gels, aluminium oxide, aluminosilicates, porous glasses, etc. have been discussed. The morphology of the carbon deposit depends on the course of the pyrolysis reaction and determines the surface properties of complex adsorbents and the possibilities of their practical utilization as sorbents and catalysts. The methods of modification of adsorption properties of such adsorbents prepared on technical and laboratory scales were also presented. Thermal properties of carbon-mineral adsorbents in atmospheres of different gases were also discussed.
