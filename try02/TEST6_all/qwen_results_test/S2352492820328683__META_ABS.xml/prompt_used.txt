You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of two-dimensional holey MnO2/graphene oxide nanosheets with high catalytic performance for the glycolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been extensively studied as promising heterogeneous catalysts because of their high surface area, outstanding mechanical strength, and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Herein, we report an efficient and simple two-step strategy for the synthesis of 2D holey and ultrathin MnO2/graphene oxide nanosheets. As a 2D nanoporous support, holey graphene oxide (HGO) nanosheets are prepared by an oxidative etching method. The uniform and conformal deposition of MnO2 onto the HGO surface is performed by a solution-based self-limiting redox reaction, resulting in nanoporous MnO2/HGO nanosheets with a high surface area. The resulting MnO2/HGO shows outstanding catalytic performance for the glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). A high conversion of PET (100%) and a high yield of a bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) are achieved within a short reaction time of 10 min at a reaction temperature of 200 °C. Furthermore, the MnO2/HGO catalyst shows excellent recyclability for the glycolysis of PET; a BHET yield of 100% is obtained after 5 cycles.
