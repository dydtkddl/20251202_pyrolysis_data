Particle behaviours of biomass gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed Biomass gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor is numerically studied based on a particle-scale computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM), with thermochemical and polydispersity effects featuring. After model validation, the particle-scale information (e.g., particle motions, particle mixing, solid dispersion, and heat transfer contribution) are thoroughly explored with the discussion of the effects of several critical operating parameters on particle behaviours. The results show that the middle dense region has the highest biomass pyrolysis reaction rate due to the vigorous particle motion. Sand and biomass particles show synchronous horizontal motions, and the solid vertical dispersion coefficients are much higher than the solid horizontal ones, denoting that the vertically introduced gas flow dominates bed hydrodynamics. A higher operating temperature causes a higher solid dispersion coefficient. Elevating temperature and steam to biomass ratio (S/B) first increases and then decreases the particle mixing index. Convection plays a dominant role during the biomass gasification process, followed by the radiation and heat of reaction. The conduction accounts for the smallest proportion and can be neglected. Increasing operating temperature promotes chemical reactions, biomass temperature, and all heat transfer modes. Increasing S/B promotes biomass motions and gasification reactions, leading to more heat consumed and biomass temperature decrease. Decreasing biomass temperature results in a larger temperature difference between biomass particles and bed material, which enhances the conduction, convection, and radiation.
