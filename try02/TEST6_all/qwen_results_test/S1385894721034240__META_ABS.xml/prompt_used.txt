You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particle behaviours of biomass gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed Biomass gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor is numerically studied based on a particle-scale computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM), with thermochemical and polydispersity effects featuring. After model validation, the particle-scale information (e.g., particle motions, particle mixing, solid dispersion, and heat transfer contribution) are thoroughly explored with the discussion of the effects of several critical operating parameters on particle behaviours. The results show that the middle dense region has the highest biomass pyrolysis reaction rate due to the vigorous particle motion. Sand and biomass particles show synchronous horizontal motions, and the solid vertical dispersion coefficients are much higher than the solid horizontal ones, denoting that the vertically introduced gas flow dominates bed hydrodynamics. A higher operating temperature causes a higher solid dispersion coefficient. Elevating temperature and steam to biomass ratio (S/B) first increases and then decreases the particle mixing index. Convection plays a dominant role during the biomass gasification process, followed by the radiation and heat of reaction. The conduction accounts for the smallest proportion and can be neglected. Increasing operating temperature promotes chemical reactions, biomass temperature, and all heat transfer modes. Increasing S/B promotes biomass motions and gasification reactions, leading to more heat consumed and biomass temperature decrease. Decreasing biomass temperature results in a larger temperature difference between biomass particles and bed material, which enhances the conduction, convection, and radiation.
