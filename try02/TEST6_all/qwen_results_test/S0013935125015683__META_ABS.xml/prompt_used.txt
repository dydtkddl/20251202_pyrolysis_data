You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Response to microplastics exposure and changes in system performance: a stark contrast between domestic sewage and landfill leachate Explored the evolution process of representative polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) in anaerobic/aerobic biological treatment of domestic sewage and landfill leachate, and their effects on system efficiency, sludge performance, and microbial community structure. The results showed that microplastics (MPs) promoted the degradation of COD and NH3-N in domestic wastewater (approximately 99.00 % and 98.16 %), but this result was completely opposite to that in the leachate. The biofilm formation of MPs in leachate was relatively fast in the initial stage, with a biofilm amount (9.39) higher than that in domestic sewage (1.05), showing an “S”-shaped trend, but with large fluctuations over time. The amount of PE and PS biofilm in domestic sewage varied with different oxygen concentrations, but the amount of PS biofilm in leachate was generally higher than that in PE, and PS was more sensitive to biodegradation, while PE had stronger resistance to microbial attacks. Meanwhile, the presence of MPs significantly enhanced the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances in the leachate (139.81 mg/g MLVSS, anaerobic condition on day 15), increased the concentration of heavy metals in the supernatant (842.91 μg/L, anaerobic condition on day 15), manifested as Mn and Zn. MPs stress led to varying degrees of changes in the structure of microbial communities, but the microbial abundance on the surfaces of PE and PS in the same reactor was similar. Ottowia, unclassifiedd_f_Rhizobiaceae, and Castellaniella were potential MPs degradation genera. The proportion of Thermomonas in the leachate system was about three times that of domestic sewage. The symbiotic mode between MPs and dominant bacteria in activated sludge confirmed the shaping of microbial community structure by MPs. This study contributes to improving the overall understanding of the environmental behavior and risks of MPs in domestic wastewater and leachate biological systems.
