You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flash pyrolysis of Silopi asphaltite in a free-fall reactor under vacuum Flash pyrolysis experiments on asphaltite samples were performed in a free-fall reactor under vacuum to determine the effects of pyrolysis temperature, feed rate and particle size. Maximum liquid yield of 13wt.% was obtained in free-fall reactor under vacuum when the pyrolysis temperature was 700°C, feed rate was 0.4gmin−1 and particle sizes were between 0.075 and 0.250mm. The liquid products obtained at various pyrolysis conditions were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and liquid products were classified as following: C5–C10, C11–C15, C16–C20 and C20+. The amount of saturated hydrocarbons decreased while the amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons increased with increase of temperature. While percent of C5–C10 unsaturated hydrocarbons continuously increased with increase of temperature, the percent of C11–C15 unsaturated hydrocarbons increased up to 750°C and then started to diminish. Functional group analysis of solid residue was carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). The proximate analysis of solid residue indicated that percent of fixed carbon and ash increased with temperature.
