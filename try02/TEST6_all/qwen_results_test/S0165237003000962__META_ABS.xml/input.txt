Pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry A method for evaluating the combustibility of milligram samples is described. Pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimetry (PCFC) separately reproduces the solid state and gas phase processes of flaming combustion in a nonflaming test by controlled pyrolysis of the sample in an inert gas stream followed by high temperature oxidation of the volatile pyrolysis products. Oxygen consumption calorimetry is used to measure the heat of combustion of the pyrolysis products. The maximum amount of heat released per unit mass per degree of temperature (J g−1 K−1) is a material property that appears to be a good predictor of flammability.
