You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microscopic, mechanical and thermal properties of spark plasma sintered ZrB2 based composite containing polycarbosilane derived SiC ZrB2-SiCp (w/w 80:20) composites were spark plasma sintered at 1900, 2000 and 2100°C with ton =50ms and toff =5ms conditions under 50MPa pressure for 15min. SiC was obtained by in situ pyrolysis of polycarbosilane during sintering. The FTIR spectra of semi-pyrolysed ZrB2-SiCp powder showed that pre-ceramic PCS polymeric bands such as Si-CH2-Si, Si-CH3 and Si-H weakened and few characteristic bands like Si-C, Si-O and C = C peaks appeared strong in the spectra. In ZrB2-SiCP composition, uniform distribution of ZrB2 and secondary SiC phases were found in the sintered sample. The interfaces between hexagonal ZrB2 and needle shaped SiC were found in high resolution bright field TEM images. The Vickers' micro-hardness, fracture toughness (measured by DCM) of ZrB2-SiCp composite sintered at 2000°C achieved up to 16.22GPa and 3.69MPa√m, respectively. The critical energy release rate (GIC) value was 27.46J·m−2 implying that the composite resists fracture during indentation. Wear resistance coefficient and wear rate values of all the composites were found to be very low. Thermal conductivity values of all the composites varied from 78.09 to 57.20W/m·K in 100°C to 1000°C range.
