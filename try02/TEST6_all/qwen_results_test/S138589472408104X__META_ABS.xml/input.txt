Perovskite oxide redox materials for two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting The dominated fossil energy application has caused a continuously increased CO2 emission, which exacerbates global warming concerns and poses environmental risks. The solar thermochemical CO2 splitting technology can be a promising complement to CO2 conversion in the context of carbon capture, utilization, and storage. Perovskite oxides can serve as redox materials to mediate the two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting, in which they can be initially reduced and subsequently oxidized by CO2 to produce CO fuel driven by full-spectrum solar energy. Here, we comprehensively review the development of perovskite oxide redox materials including Mn-, Fe-, and Co-based perovskite oxides for two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting. The fundamental thermodynamics, kinetics, defect chemistry, oxygen exchange mechanisms, solar thermochemical reactors, material properties, and progress in thermochemical CO2 splitting cycles for perovskite oxides are discussed. We summarize the performances of various reported perovskite oxides, which can help to understand the structure-composition-performance correlation. The progress in computations is also discussed. Finally, we offer our perspectives on the remaining challenges and future directions in the development of perovskite oxide redox materials toward potential practical application in two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting.
