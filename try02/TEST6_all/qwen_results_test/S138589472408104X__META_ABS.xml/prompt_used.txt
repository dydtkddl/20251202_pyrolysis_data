You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Perovskite oxide redox materials for two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting The dominated fossil energy application has caused a continuously increased CO2 emission, which exacerbates global warming concerns and poses environmental risks. The solar thermochemical CO2 splitting technology can be a promising complement to CO2 conversion in the context of carbon capture, utilization, and storage. Perovskite oxides can serve as redox materials to mediate the two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting, in which they can be initially reduced and subsequently oxidized by CO2 to produce CO fuel driven by full-spectrum solar energy. Here, we comprehensively review the development of perovskite oxide redox materials including Mn-, Fe-, and Co-based perovskite oxides for two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting. The fundamental thermodynamics, kinetics, defect chemistry, oxygen exchange mechanisms, solar thermochemical reactors, material properties, and progress in thermochemical CO2 splitting cycles for perovskite oxides are discussed. We summarize the performances of various reported perovskite oxides, which can help to understand the structure-composition-performance correlation. The progress in computations is also discussed. Finally, we offer our perspectives on the remaining challenges and future directions in the development of perovskite oxide redox materials toward potential practical application in two-step solar thermochemical CO2 splitting.
