You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing the performance of a PtPd/HY catalyst for HDPE/VGO hydrocracking through zeolite desilication The valorization of post-consumer waste plastic in a refinery is an attractive initiative to avoid environmental problems caused by the poor plastic waste management. The modification of a bifunctional PtPd/HY catalyst through desilication (using NaOH) of the ultrastable HY zeolite has been carried out to upgrade waste plastic (high-density polyethylene (HDPE)) dissolved in a secondary refinery stream (vacuum gas oil (VGO)) through hydrocracking. Three different catalysts have been studied: the parent (Cat-A), undergoing a desilication cycle (Cat-B), and subjected to two cycles of desilication (Cat-C). The characterization techniques employed have been: N2 adsorption–desorption, TEM, ICP-AES, tert-butylamine-TPD, pyridine FTIR, WDXRF, XRD and TPO. The hydrocracking tests have been carried out in a semi-batch reactor at: 440 °C; 80 bar; catalyst to feed ratio, 0.1 gcat (gfeed)–1; HDPE to feed ratio, 0.2 gHDPE (gfeed)–1; and reaction time, 2 h. The products have been fractioned according to their boiling point range in: gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The composition of each fraction has been determined in terms of concentration of paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and (mono-, di- and poly-) aromatics. The results show that alkaline treated catalysts enhance the fuel production, with high HDPE and HCO conversions. The Cat-C (the one submitted to two desilication cycles) has displayed the greatest performance, reducing by half the gas yield and increasing the naphtha yield by 51 wt% respect to those obtained with the parent catalyst (Cat-A). Moreover, it has decreased the coke deposition and the coke formed has been less developed.
