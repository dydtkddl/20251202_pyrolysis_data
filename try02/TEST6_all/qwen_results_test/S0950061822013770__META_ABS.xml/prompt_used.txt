You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanical, thermal and acoustical characteristics of composite board kneaded by leather fiber and semi-liquefied bamboo Collecting waste and using it to prepare value-added products with better performance is the need of the times. Considering this goal, the experiment has completed the work of preparing value-added boards using leather fiber (LF) and semi-liquefied bamboo fiber (SLB). First, the feasibility of mechano-chemical action is determined by kneading two fibers, and then, the composited board was prepared by the response surface method, in which the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) and silane coupling agent (KH550) were used to improve the hydrophobicity and physicomechanical properties in this experiment. When the composition (by weight) of composited board (LBTK board) is 160 % LF, 100% SLB, 40% TPU (based on LF), 20% KH550 (based on TPU) and the kneading time is 23 min at 78 ℃, the integrated performance of the LBTK board meets the main index of the physicomechanical properties of the LBTK board in the national standard GB/T 24137–2009 “Wood Plastic Decorative Board”. The thermal insulation and sound absorption properties of the LBTK board were also evaluated, including the thermal conductivity (0.0502 W/m·K) and the sound transmission loss (25 ∼ 45 dB) in the range of 500 ∼ 14000 Hz. Finally, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), the surface morphology, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability of the LBTK board were measured. The results show that the LBTK board has the potential application value and the experiment also provides a way to recycle the two kinds of waste.
