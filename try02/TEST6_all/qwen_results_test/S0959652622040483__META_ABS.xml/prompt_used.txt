You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of processing and environmental impact of polymer compounds reinforced with banana fiber in an injection molding process The global consumption of thermoplastic materials of fossil origin continues to grow, generating high environmental impacts mainly due to the energy consumed during their production and processing. The use of natural materials, such as banana fiber (BF), present a sustainable alternative for the gradual replacement of these thermoplastic materials, potentially reducing the environmental impact and improving their mechanical performance. This work presents the development of HDPE compounds reinforced with BF for injection molding of components with lower environmental impact. To this end, the processing and treatment of the banana pseudostem fiber have been analyzed, and compounds with fiber percentages of up to 20 wt %, with and without chemical treatment, have been developed and characterized thermal and mechanically. Finally, thickness optimizations of a case study component have been carried out through finite element simulation, with fiber percentages up to 30 wt %, maintaining the stiffness of the original HDPE component. A Life Cycle Assessment was also carried out to assess the influence of the different processing scenarios. The results showed, on the one hand, that the fibers without chemical treatment and with mechanical combing allow improvements in the mechanical properties of HDPE compounds similar to those obtained with chemically treated fibers but considerably reducing the impacts due to the suppression of the fiber treatment (chemical products, subsequent drying, etc.). On the other hand, the environmental impact analysis showed that compounds with percentages of untreated fiber greater than 20 wt % reduce the impact of the components produced compared to pure HDPE. Finally, the incorporation of the BF also allowed the design optimization of the study component, reducing its thickness but maintaining the same original stiffness, further improving its environmental impact.
