You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-stage ethanol to butadiene process: Analysis and design of a multi-tubular fixed bed reactor The paper develops a design feasibility study of a multi-tubular polytropic fixed bed reactor for the one-stage ethanol to 1,3-butadiene (ETB) process employing a modified MgO-SiO2 catalyst. The analysis quantifies the effect of the internal diffusion on scaling up the catalyst activity and selectivity by considering a complex chemistry of seven parallel/series reactions described by detailed kinetic modelling. The efficient numerical solution takes advantage from the MATLAB™ function bvp5c. The simulation model allows scanning the catalytic process by profiles of species’ concentrations, reaction rates and effectiveness factors, inside the catalyst particle and over the reactor. The butadiene yield is controlled by the accumulation in particle of ethanol and key intermediates, as acetaldehyde and crotonaldehyde, related to internal chemical reaction with diffusion and external mass and heat transport rates. The catalyst performance depends significantly on the pellet size that becomes optimization variable for catalyst selection and reactor design. Catalyst particles in the range 2 to 3 mm with tubes of to 25 to 40 mm diameters are the most efficient for achieving 80% butadiene carbon selectivity suitable for an industrial process. The modelling approach is generic for calculating the catalyst effectiveness and designing catalytic chemical reactors involving complex reactions.
