Present and Projected Developments in Hydrogen Production: A Technological Review⁎ Energy supplies that are safe, environmentally friendly, dependable, and cost-effective are important for society's long-term growth and improved living standards, though political, social, and economic barriers may inhibit their availability. Constantly increasing energy demand is induced by substantial population growth and economic development, putting an increasing strain on fossil fuel management and sustainability, which account for a major portion of this rising energy demand and, moreover, creates difficulties because of greenhouse gas emissions growth and the depletion of resources. Such impediments necessitate a global shift away from traditional energy sources and toward renewables. Aside from its traditional role, H 2 is viewed as a promising energy vector and is gaining international attention as a promising fuel path, as it provides numerous benefits in use case scenarios and, unlike other synthesized carbon-based fuels, could be carbon-free or perhaps even negative on a life-cycle criterion. Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most significant chemical substances on earth and can be obtained as molecular dihydrogen through various techniques from both non-renewable and renewable sources. The drive of this paper is to deliver a technological overview of hydrogen production methods. The major challenges, development and research priorities, and potential prospects for H2 production was discussed.
