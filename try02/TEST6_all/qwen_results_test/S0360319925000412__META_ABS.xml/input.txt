Investigation of the use of carbon-based supports in the catalytic hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane In this study, the effects of heterogeneous catalysis systems consisting of carbon-based support materials such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and activated carbon (AC) and Pd and Co metals on the hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB) are investigated. For this purpose, activated carbon obtained from the Paulownia tree and thermal reduction of graphene oxide, which was synthesized from graphene oxide using the Hummers method, are used as support materials. Pd and Co metals are loaded onto the support materials by the impregnation-reduction method, first separately as 5% by mass and then together as 2.5% by mass. EDAB hydrolysis is carried out using Co/rGO, Pd–Co/rGO, Co/AC and Pd–Co/AC catalysts at 50 and 70 °C and at different EDAB concentrations (0.02–0.03 M) using a gas burette system. The highest hydrogen production rate (HGR) and activation energy are found to be 604.73 ml/min.gcat and 25.16 kJ/mol for the Pd–Co/rGO catalyst, respectively. Catalyst characterizations are carried out by FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM, BET, XRD, and XPS analyses. The BET surface areas of GO and AC were determined as 216.76 m2/g and 1440.32 m2/g, respectively. After metal loading, the surface areas of the materials were observed to decrease to 154.99 m2/g (Co/rGO), 115.61 m2/g (Pd–Co/rGO), and 201.00 m2/g (Pd–Co/AC), respectively.
