You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the use of carbon-based supports in the catalytic hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane In this study, the effects of heterogeneous catalysis systems consisting of carbon-based support materials such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and activated carbon (AC) and Pd and Co metals on the hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB) are investigated. For this purpose, activated carbon obtained from the Paulownia tree and thermal reduction of graphene oxide, which was synthesized from graphene oxide using the Hummers method, are used as support materials. Pd and Co metals are loaded onto the support materials by the impregnation-reduction method, first separately as 5% by mass and then together as 2.5% by mass. EDAB hydrolysis is carried out using Co/rGO, Pd–Co/rGO, Co/AC and Pd–Co/AC catalysts at 50 and 70 °C and at different EDAB concentrations (0.02–0.03 M) using a gas burette system. The highest hydrogen production rate (HGR) and activation energy are found to be 604.73 ml/min.gcat and 25.16 kJ/mol for the Pd–Co/rGO catalyst, respectively. Catalyst characterizations are carried out by FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM, BET, XRD, and XPS analyses. The BET surface areas of GO and AC were determined as 216.76 m2/g and 1440.32 m2/g, respectively. After metal loading, the surface areas of the materials were observed to decrease to 154.99 m2/g (Co/rGO), 115.61 m2/g (Pd–Co/rGO), and 201.00 m2/g (Pd–Co/AC), respectively.
