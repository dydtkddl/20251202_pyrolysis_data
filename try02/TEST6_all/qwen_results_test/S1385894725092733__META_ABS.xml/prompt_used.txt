You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biological upcycling of polystyrene into ready-to-use plastic monomers and plastics using metabolically engineered Pseudomonas putida The persistent accumulation of plastic waste, particularly polystyrene (PS), poses significant environmental challenges because of its extensive use and low recycling rates. Addressing these challenges necessitates innovative and sustainable solutions. This study presents a strategy to upcycle PS waste into valuable chemical products, including adipic acid, hexanediol, hexamethylenediamine, and nylon-6,6, using metabolically engineered Pseudomonas putida KT2440. This process involves the photolytic degradation of PS into benzoic acid, followed by microbial conversion into cis,cis-muconate (MA) and chemical synthesis of the final products. The engineered strains withstood 30 mM concentrations of PS-derived aromatics and converted them stoichiometrically into MA in the presence of glucose as a growth substrate. 13C metabolic flux analysis revealed energy and redox limitations in the presence of 25 mM benzoate and 300 mM MA. The cells responded to stress by enhancing the flux for periplasmic glucose oxidation and fluxes through the NADPH-forming dehydrogenases; this process caused more than 40 % glucose‑carbon loss into byproducts. Fine-tuned dynamic glucose and benzoate feeding enabled high-level MA production. Energy-optimized genome-reduced strains were used to increase carbon efficiency. A final MA titer of over 65 g L−1 was achieved in fed-batch fermentation. This process was demonstrated using the glucose derived from a viscose textile waste blend as the growth substrate and resulted in fully waste-based products. The resulting adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine were polymerized into nylon-6,6 with properties comparable to those of petrochemical-derived polymers, revealing a sustainable pathway for PS upcycling. This research provides a proof-of-concept for bacterial upgrading of PS-derived substrates and a viable method for managing plastic waste and producing valuable chemical products.
