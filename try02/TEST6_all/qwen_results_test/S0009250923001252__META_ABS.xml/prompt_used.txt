You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oil and gas production from the pyrolytic transformation of recycled plastic waste: An integral study by polymer families Different plastics recovered from a local urban solid waste plant were collected before landfilling, separated, and classified by families, i.e. polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), high impact and expanded polystyrene (HIPS and EPS, respectively), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). A systematic pyrolysis study was carried out to compare the different behavior registered in each plastic type, and an integral analysis of the produced oils and synthetic gas was conducted. In general terms, the oil yield followed the order EPS > PP > PE > HIPS > PET > PVC, reaching maximum values over 500 °C after 1 h of treatment. The oil from HIPS, EPS, PET, and PP was rich in light compounds, i.e., C5-C9 hydrocarbons. Almost 100 % of the oil from HIPS and EPS pyrolysis was aromatic. The aromatic fraction was important in the case of PVC (57 %) and PET (45 %). PE produced an oil with the most varied distribution of compounds but rich in olefins (67 %). The analysis of the non-condensable composition of the gas showed that in all the pyrolysis gases methane was over 50 % (vol.), followed by ethane in importance. CO was produced in the case of PET.
