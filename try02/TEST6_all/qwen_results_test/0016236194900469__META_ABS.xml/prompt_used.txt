You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pressure and temperature effects in bituminous coal pyrolysis: experimental observations and a transient lumped-parameter model Total weight loss and yields of tar, light gases and pyridine-extractables of cooled chars from pyrolysis of 63–75 μm particles of Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous coal, as affected by total pressure (0.1–1 MPa He) and final temperature (753–1233 K) were measured at a nominal heating rate of 1000 Ks − 1, using an electrical screen heater reactor. Molecular weight distributions of tars and changes in coal particle morphology during pyrolysis were determined. Above 973 K, with an increase in pressure from 0.1 to 1 MPa, tar yield declined by 6–7 wt% (daf coal basis); increases in the yields of char (~5 wt%) and light gases (mainly C1C3 hydrocarbons) (~ 1 wt%) accounted for most or all of this tar loss. Tar MW declined slightly with increasing temperature from ~ 850 to 973K at 0.1 MPa, and from ~ 850 to 1233K at 1 MPa. It also decreased moderately with increasing pressure from 0.1 to 1 MPa at all temperatures from 850 to 1200 K, except in the neighbourhood of 970 K, where no change with pressure was apparent. A mathematical model was developed to predict tar and extractables yields from rapid pyrolysis of softening coals. The model accounts for intraparticle transport and secondary reactions of liquids generated by coal pyrolysis, and satisfyingly captures important features of the current experimental data, e.g. temperature and pressure effects on tar yields, and rapid changes in extractables yields from 760 to 900 K at 0.1 and 1 MPa. The data and modelling results indicate that secondary reactions of liquids within the coal significantly affect tar release at temperatures ⩾ 1000 K.
