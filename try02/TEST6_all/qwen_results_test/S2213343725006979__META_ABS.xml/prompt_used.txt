You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

NS-CQDs/TiO2 hybrid nanocomposites incorporated with nutshell derived NS-CQDs as photocatalyst for environmental/biological applications and cytotoxicity effect Being a class of carbon nanoparticles, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been used as a precursor in modification of semiconductor photocatalysts. The efficient utilization of natural resources ‘‘biomass’’ for the synthesis of CQDs which are important for reducing environmental pollution, and also creates a field of application area such as water treatment. In this work, fix-bed pyrolysis reactor was used to synthesis the bright fluorescence NS-CQDs using nutshell (NS) without any chemicals. One-dimensional TiO2 nanorods (TNRs) fabricated via hydrothermal route was decorated with low-cost and eco-friendly (NS-CQDs) by wet impregnation method to produce hybrid NS-CQDs/TNRs nanocomposite. Various characterization techniques such as TGA, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM/EDS, HRTEM, FTIR, fluorescence and UV–vis spectroscopy have been employed to confirm the structural and optical properties. The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared NS-CQDs/TNRs were investigated for methylene blue (MB), hexavalent chromium Cr (VI), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Aspergillus niger (A. niger) under UV-A. Subsequently, MTT assay was carried out using ARPE-19 (Epithelium) and MCF-7 (Breast Cancer) cell lines as the model system so as to designate whether produced NS-CQDs and hybrid NS-CQDs/TNRs composite was cytotoxic or not. The obtained results suggest that the photocatalytic activity of NS-CQDs/TNRs composites was slightly enhanced as compared to that of TNRs while not only NS-CQDs but also NS-CQDs/TNRs composites show no significant change in terms of cytotoxicity.
