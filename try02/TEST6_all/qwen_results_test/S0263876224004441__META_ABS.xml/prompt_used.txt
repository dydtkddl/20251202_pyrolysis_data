You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling and design of a combined electrified steam methane reforming-pressure swing adsorption process Steam methane reforming (SMR) is the most widely used hydrogen (H2) production method, converting natural gas and steam into H2 and carbon dioxide (CO2). SMR is a mature industrial technology that burns fossil fuels to provide heat to the endothermic reforming reaction and to generate steam, which contributes to the production of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reduce heating-based emissions, an electrically-heated steam methane reforming process has been proposed. Conventional SMR uses a packed bed catalyst and receives heat through radiation from hot flames in the surrounding furnace; on the other hand, an electrified SMR employs a washcoated catalyst, and is resistively-heated through the wall of the reactor coil. To gain further insight into the scalability of hydrogen production processes using electrically-heated reformers, this paper takes experimental data from an electrified reformer built at UCLA, extracts kinetic parameters, and uses these parameters to model and scale up a hydrogen production plant with a hydrogen production capacity of 231 kg/h (2607 Nm 3 /h). The simulated plant includes a reformer, two water gas shift reactors, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) for separation, and a heat exchange network to make steam for the reformer. A two-column-PSA process is dynamically modeled to output 99% H2 purity, and the pressures necessary for separation and H2 recovery are calculated using steady-state simulation data. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for the most energy-efficient H2 production conditions (e.g., operating pressure, heat flux), and CO2 production amounts are compared to a conventional SMR process, demonstrating that electrified SMR can potentially be a significantly cleaner alternative. The optimization of electrified reformers must target high mass and heat transfer along the full length of the reformer to achieve near full methane conversion that will minimize off-gas generation from the PSA unit.
