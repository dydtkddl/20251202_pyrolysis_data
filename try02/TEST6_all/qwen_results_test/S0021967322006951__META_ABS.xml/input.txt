Influence of particle characteristics, heating temperature and time on the pyrolysis product distributions of polystyrene micro- and nano-plastics Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) has been widely used for the detection of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in the environment. However, there is a lack of thorough investigation on the effects of pyrolysis temperature and time, as well as the particle source, size and mass of MNPs on the pyrolysis efficiency and pyrolysis product distribution of MNPs. Herein, taking the common plastics polystyrene (PS) as a model, we systematically evaluated the influences of the above factors on the pyrolysis of PS MNPs. Results showed that pyrolysis temperature and time significantly affect the pyrolysis efficiency. By measuring the relative response values of the indicator compound styrene trimers to styrene monomer, the optimum condition was determined as the temperature of 510 ℃ and pyrolysis time longer than 18 s. Meanwhile, the mass of MNPs also affected the distribution of PS pyrolysis products. The proportions of styrene dimers and trimers increased slightly with PS MNP mass, while the source, particle size of MNPs have little effect on the pyrolysis product distribution. This work proposed a suitable pyrolysis temperature and time for the determination of PS by Py-GC/MS, which would contribute to the accurate analysis of PS MNPs in the environment.
