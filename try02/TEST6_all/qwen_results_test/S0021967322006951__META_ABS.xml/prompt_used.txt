You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of particle characteristics, heating temperature and time on the pyrolysis product distributions of polystyrene micro- and nano-plastics Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) has been widely used for the detection of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in the environment. However, there is a lack of thorough investigation on the effects of pyrolysis temperature and time, as well as the particle source, size and mass of MNPs on the pyrolysis efficiency and pyrolysis product distribution of MNPs. Herein, taking the common plastics polystyrene (PS) as a model, we systematically evaluated the influences of the above factors on the pyrolysis of PS MNPs. Results showed that pyrolysis temperature and time significantly affect the pyrolysis efficiency. By measuring the relative response values of the indicator compound styrene trimers to styrene monomer, the optimum condition was determined as the temperature of 510 ℃ and pyrolysis time longer than 18 s. Meanwhile, the mass of MNPs also affected the distribution of PS pyrolysis products. The proportions of styrene dimers and trimers increased slightly with PS MNP mass, while the source, particle size of MNPs have little effect on the pyrolysis product distribution. This work proposed a suitable pyrolysis temperature and time for the determination of PS by Py-GC/MS, which would contribute to the accurate analysis of PS MNPs in the environment.
