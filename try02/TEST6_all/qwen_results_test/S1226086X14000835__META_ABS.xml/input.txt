CFD simulation of fluidized bed reactors for polyolefin production – A review This literature survey focuses on the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in various aspects of the fluidized bed reactor. Although fluidized bed reactors are used in various industrial applications, this first-of-its-kind review highlights the use of CFD on polyolefin production. It is shown that CFD has been utilized for the following mechanisms of polymerization: governing of bubble formation, electrostatic charge effect, gas–solid flow behavior, particle distribution, solid–gas circulation pattern, bed expansion consequence, mixing and segregation, agglomeration and shear forces. Heat and mass transfer in the reactor modeling using CFD principles has also been taken under consideration. A number of softwares are available to interpret the data of the CFD simulation but only few softwares possess the analytical capability to interpret the complex flow behavior of fluidization. In this review, the popular softwares with their framework and application have been discussed. The advantages and feasibility of applying CFD to olefin polymerization in fluidized beds were deliberated and the prospect of future CFD applications was also discussed.
