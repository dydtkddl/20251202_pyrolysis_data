Overarching advancements in building practical Li-S batteries: A holistic review Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries have great potential due to its high energy density, abundance and cost benefits. Significant progress has been made in exploring the performance improvement of lab-scale Li-S batteries. Some of the aspects of focus were, sulfur-host, compositing, catalytic activities, electrolyte modulations, separator modifications, solid-electrolytes, anode with prelithiation, Li-metal anode etc. Advancements on these aspects have been scattered across the literature and there is lack of correlative and comprehensive review in the given space. Dispite the reasonable performance of laboratory scale Li-S cells, their practicality is hindered during the device upscaling. In view of addressing the research gap between lab-scale and large format cells delivering poor energy density. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of multifaceted aspects of recent advanced in Li-S batteries. Such a comprehensive review has been lacking in the last couple of years while significant research have been published. Here, we also provide inherent challenges, potential research possibilities and prospective benefits of Li-S batteries.
