You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The typical cellular microstructures developed in powder-based additively manufactured metallic materials: formation mechanisms, properties, outlooks and challenges Cellular microstructures are intrinsically associated with the printability and mechanical-functional performance of laser-additively manufactured metallic materials. An in-depth understanding of formation mechanisms under extreme processing conditions and impacts on mechanical-functional performance remains critical to improving the application prospects of laser additive manufacturing. In this paper, vital insights into the characteristics, formation mechanisms, mechanical-functional performance, and prospects of cellular microstructures are orchestrated and articulated. First, the differences between dislocation cellular microstructures obtained from conventional methods and those induced by additive manufacturing are summarised through a comparative analysis. Based on the diverse environments of sub-boundaries, almost all cellular microstructures in metallic materials are then exemplified and classified into three categories: dislocation-formed cellular microstructures, both with and without elemental segregation, and eutectic-formed cellular microstructures. For each category, its formation mechanisms related to analysis approaches and evaluation of mechanical-functional performance are delineated and discussed in detail. Finally, insights into the formation mechanisms, model development, thermal stability of cellular microstructures, and countermeasures for aspects of their negative influence on printability and performance are presented. Collectively, this systematic review of cellular microstructures provides a foundational framework to guide the design, manufacture, and industrial-scale implementation of high-performance metallic components.
