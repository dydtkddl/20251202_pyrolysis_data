You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) with castor oil using microwave heating The chemical recycling of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using castor oil (CO) as a reagent is reported. CO presents a renewable alternative to petrochemical based reagents, e.g. glycols, and enables also substantial modification of final physico-chemical properties of a received product. Advantageously, microwave irradiation was used to accelerate the depolymerization of PET. A composition of obtained product was strongly influenced by the reaction temperature. When the decomposition of PET was performed at temperature higher than 240 °C, then a significant extent of side products based on PET oligomers and transesterified CO was observed due to dehydration and hydrolysis of CO. Contrary to that, PET decomposition took place at slow rate below 230 °C and the optimal reaction temperature lies in the relatively narrow interval from 230 °C to 240 °C. The product prepared in the optimal temperature range did not contain any high molecular weight PET oligomers. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry enabled to identify the structures included in the obtained polyol product. The maximum number of six repeating monomeric unit of PET was found in the product, which confirmed practically the complete depolymerization of PET chain and good reactivity of the acylester hydroxyl groups of CO.
