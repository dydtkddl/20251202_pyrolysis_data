Machine learning-driven identification of critical parameters governing waste and biomass pyrolysis-reforming process using char-based catalysts for enhanced H2 production Pyrolysis-reforming process based on char catalyst is a highly efficient approach for producing H2 from waste and biomass. To enhance H2 production, this study employed machine learning to explore the key properties of char catalysts and optimized reaction conditions in promoting H2 production during pyrolysis-reforming process, as well as the influences of feedstock properties. Through training with a dataset containing more than 300 items and comparison of three ensemble learning models, CatBoost demonstrated the best performance in predicting both H2 yield and concentration, with their R2 values being 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. SHAP analysis revealed that H/C was the key property of the char catalyst affecting H2 yield, while active metal load is the primary factor influencing H2 concentration. In addition, partial dependence plots not only revealed the trends of individual feature on H2 yield and concentration but also analyzed the interactions among different features. Based on these findings, this study proposed a catalyst and reaction conditions’ optimization plan aimed at enhancing H2 production, offering valuable insights for the development and application of char catalysts and improving H2 production efficiency from waste and biomass through pyrolysis-reforming technology.
