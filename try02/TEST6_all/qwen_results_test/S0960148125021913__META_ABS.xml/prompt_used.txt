You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Machine learning-driven identification of critical parameters governing waste and biomass pyrolysis-reforming process using char-based catalysts for enhanced H2 production Pyrolysis-reforming process based on char catalyst is a highly efficient approach for producing H2 from waste and biomass. To enhance H2 production, this study employed machine learning to explore the key properties of char catalysts and optimized reaction conditions in promoting H2 production during pyrolysis-reforming process, as well as the influences of feedstock properties. Through training with a dataset containing more than 300 items and comparison of three ensemble learning models, CatBoost demonstrated the best performance in predicting both H2 yield and concentration, with their R2 values being 0.93 and 0.88, respectively. SHAP analysis revealed that H/C was the key property of the char catalyst affecting H2 yield, while active metal load is the primary factor influencing H2 concentration. In addition, partial dependence plots not only revealed the trends of individual feature on H2 yield and concentration but also analyzed the interactions among different features. Based on these findings, this study proposed a catalyst and reaction conditions’ optimization plan aimed at enhancing H2 production, offering valuable insights for the development and application of char catalysts and improving H2 production efficiency from waste and biomass through pyrolysis-reforming technology.
