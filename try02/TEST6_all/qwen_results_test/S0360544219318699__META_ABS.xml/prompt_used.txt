You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of zeolite catalysts on product distribution and synergy during wood-plastic composite catalytic pyrolysis The catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood-polypropylene composite (WPP) over different zeolite catalysts (HZSM-5, HBeta, HY, and HUSY) was investigated to obtain the influence of zeolite properties on both product distribution and synergistic effect using Py-GC/MS. The yield of aromatics was in the order: HZSM-5 > HY > HBeta > HUSY. HZSM-5 facilitated the formation of monomethyl aromatics, whereas HBeta and HY tended to promote the formation of polymethyl aromatics due to the larger pore size. The coke yield of HZSM-5 (6.4%) was much lower than those of other zeolites tested (11.4–20.2%), suggesting that the pore size of a zeolite was mainly responsible for coke formation during WPP pyrolysis. The strong synergistic effects between poplar and polypropylene in WPP pyrolysis were observed with all the zeolite catalysts tested as the experimental and calculated product distribution was significantly different. The synergistic effect over HZSM-5 zeolite promoted the selectivity for polyaromatics instead of mono aromatics, whereas the mono aromatics yield was increased by 28% for HBeta and 15% for HY zeolite. Our findings suggest that the catalytic pyrolysis of wood-plastic composites over the zeolite catalyst with suitable pore size and acidity might provide a viable and efficient route to generate hydrocarbons.
