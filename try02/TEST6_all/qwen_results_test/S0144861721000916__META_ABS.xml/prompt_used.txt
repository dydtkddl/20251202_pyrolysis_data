You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of chitosan grafted polymethyl methacrylate nanopolymers and its effect on polyvinyl chloride membrane for acetone recovery by pervaporation In comparison to conventional nanoparticles biopolymer like chitosan based nanoparticles will be of much lower cost, non-toxic and more compatible with polymer membranes. As a cationic polymer surfactant chitosan is able to generate polymer nanoparticles during emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Accordingly, the organophilicity of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) membrane was significantly improved by incorporating chitosan grafted polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopolymers(NPs) prepared by emulsion polymerization. The NPs and the PVC-NP blend membranes were characterized. The chitosan: MMA wt. ratio and the wt.% of NP in PVC were optimized by a 5-level factorial design. The membranes prepared from i) PVC, PVC blended with 6.5 wt.% each of ii) chitosan, iii) PMMA and iv) NP showed a pervaporative flux (kg/m2h)/acetone selectivity of 0.439/24.31, 0.477/21.56, 0.461/23.41 and 0.502/27.96, respectively for 5.6 wt.% acetone in feed. The sorption and pervaporation data showed close fitting to ENSIC and six-parameter solution-diffusion model, respectively.
