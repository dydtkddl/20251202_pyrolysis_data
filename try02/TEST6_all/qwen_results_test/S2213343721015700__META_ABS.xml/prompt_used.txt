You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of liquid fuel from fossil-based solid wastes via pyrolysis technique: A review This study unveils the conversion of fossil-based solid waste into liquid fuel via the pyrolysis technique, starting from discovering the feedstock source to the end of product collection. The waste considered includes all types of plastic (polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene), and tyres. The concern is that more than 62% of unrecyclable fossil-based solid waste is still forwarded for improper management, leading to waste of energy sources and various environmental issues. Various studies in pyrolysis technique generally classified into three scenarios; thermal pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, and biomass co-pyrolysis, which are elaborated in this review. The study of thermal pyrolysis determines the parameter that affects the process for different material use, while catalytic pyrolysis is focused on finding the best catalyst that can improve the oil quality and reduce the wax formation. Furthermore, the biomass co-pyrolysis is aimed to evaluate the synergetic effect between biomass wood and fossil-based solid waste. This paper will be devoted to a comprehensive study of those scenarios in which possible outcomes benefit to researcher and the industry's player.
