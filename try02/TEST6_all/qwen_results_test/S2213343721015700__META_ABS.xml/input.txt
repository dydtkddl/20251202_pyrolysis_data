Recovery of liquid fuel from fossil-based solid wastes via pyrolysis technique: A review This study unveils the conversion of fossil-based solid waste into liquid fuel via the pyrolysis technique, starting from discovering the feedstock source to the end of product collection. The waste considered includes all types of plastic (polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene), and tyres. The concern is that more than 62% of unrecyclable fossil-based solid waste is still forwarded for improper management, leading to waste of energy sources and various environmental issues. Various studies in pyrolysis technique generally classified into three scenarios; thermal pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, and biomass co-pyrolysis, which are elaborated in this review. The study of thermal pyrolysis determines the parameter that affects the process for different material use, while catalytic pyrolysis is focused on finding the best catalyst that can improve the oil quality and reduce the wax formation. Furthermore, the biomass co-pyrolysis is aimed to evaluate the synergetic effect between biomass wood and fossil-based solid waste. This paper will be devoted to a comprehensive study of those scenarios in which possible outcomes benefit to researcher and the industry's player.
