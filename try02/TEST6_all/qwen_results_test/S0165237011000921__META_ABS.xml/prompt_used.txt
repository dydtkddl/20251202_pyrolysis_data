You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal decomposition of poly(propylene sebacate) and poly(propylene azelate) biodegradable polyesters: Evaluation of mechanisms using TGA, FTIR and GC/MS The synthesis, characterization and thermal behavior of two biodegradable aliphatic polyesters poly(propylene azelate) (PPAz) and poly(propylene sebacate) (PPSeb) are described in the present work. The thermal degradation of both polyesters was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TG) by the determination of their mass losses during heating. From the thermogravimetric curves it can be seen that both polyesters are thermally stable materials since PPAz has its highest decomposition rate at 411.3 while PPSeb at 413.6°C. From the variation of activation energy (E) with increasing degree of conversion it is found that the polyester's decomposition proceeds with a complex reaction mechanism with the participation of at least two different mechanisms. To evaluate these mechanisms the TG, FTIR and a combination of TG-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TG/GC–MS) methods were used. From mass ions detection of formed decomposition compounds, it was found that the decomposition of both polymers takes place, mainly, through β-hydrogen bond scission and secondarily through α-hydrogen bond scission. The main decomposition products are aldehydes, alcohols, allyl, diallyl, and carboxylic acids.
