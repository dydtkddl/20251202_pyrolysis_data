Production of biocrude via the hydrothermal liquefaction of woody biomass and upgrading into sustainable transportation fuels: A comprehensive review The utilization of woody biomass as an alternative energy source has gained significant attention as part of the effort to transition away from reliance on finite fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable options. Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) is a promising method for converting forestry-based lignocellulosic biomass into biocrude, which can serve as a substitute for fossil crude oil. This review article comprehensively depicts the advanced knowledge of hydrothermal liquefaction of woody biomass with a special focus on Canadian forest species. Further, several catalytic and non-catalytic upgrading techniques are reviewed to produce transportation fuels from woody biomass. The review concludes with a Techno-Economic Analysis, Life Cycle Analysis, and an evaluation of the commercialization potential of the biorefinery approach for producing transportation fuels from Canadian woody biomass. It also covers specific challenges and prospects related to the utilization of Canadian woody biomass for biocrude production.
