You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in TiO2-based photocatalysis for environmental remediation: Strategies for enhancing visible-light-driven activity Researchers have focused on efficient techniques for degrading hazardous organic pollutants due to their negative impacts on ecological systems, necessitating immediate remediation. Specifically, TiO2-based photocatalysts, a wide-bandgap semiconductor material, have been extensively studied for their application in environmental remediation. However, the extensive band gap energy and speedy reattachment of electron (e−) and hole (h+) pairs in bare TiO2 are considered major disadvantages for photocatalysis. This review extensively focuses on the combination of semiconducting photocatalysts for commercial outcomes to develop efficient heterojunctions with high photocatalytic activity by minimizing the e−/h+ recombination rate. The improved activity of these heterojunctions is due to their greater surface area, rich active sites, narrow band gap, and high light-harvesting tendency. In this context, strategies for increasing visible light activity, including doping with metals and non-metals, surface modifications, morphology control, composite formation, heterojunction formation, bandgap engineering, surface plasmon resonance, and optimizing reaction conditions are discussed. Furthermore, this review critically assesses the latest developments in TiO2 photocatalysts for the efficient decomposition of various organic contaminants from wastewater, such as pharmaceutical waste, dyes, pesticides, aromatic hydrocarbons, and halo compounds. This review implies that doping is an effective, economical, and simple process for TiO2 nanostructures and that a heterogeneous photocatalytic mechanism is an eco-friendly substitute for the removal of various pollutants. This review provides valuable insights for researchers involved in the development of efficient photocatalysts for environmental remediation.
