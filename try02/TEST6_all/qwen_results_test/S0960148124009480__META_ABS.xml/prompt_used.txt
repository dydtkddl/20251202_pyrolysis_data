You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of co-pyrolysis of olive pomace and thermoplastic waste via thermogravimetric analysis This work represents the first attempt to analyze kinetics, thermodynamics and reaction mechanism of olive pomace (OP) and waste plastic materials (PM) co-pyrolysis. Among PM, polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), high density polypropylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and poly (ethylene terephthalate) glycol (PETG) were selected. Non-isothermal TG experiments were carried out under inert conditions at four heating rates, namely 5, 10, 20 and 40 °C/min. The kinetic triplet for raw materials and their blends was determined using Starink, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall iso-conversional models. Pyrolysis mechanism reactions were explained by diverse models, depending on thermal degradation progress. Results shown that co-pyrolysis followed a complex multi-step reaction mechanism. A synergistic effect was detected during co-pyrolysis of OP/PM mixtures. The addition of 50 % (w/w) OP biomass to PM waste decreased the energy of activation (Ea) from 50 to 25 % for all blends, except for PVC/OP. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that adding OP generally reduces the energy barrier (ΔH), except for PS-OP, and improves energy efficiency (ΔG) by facilitating radical formation and molecular chain cleavage. As a conclusion, this study may open up new avenues for waste valorization and resource recovery. Thus, it may contribute to the transition towards a circular and sustainable economy, through zero waste goal.
