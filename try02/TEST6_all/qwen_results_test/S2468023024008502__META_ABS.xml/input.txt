Optimization of synthesis parameters for polyamide 610: Strategic tailoring for superior latent heat performance The study systematically optimizes the synthesis of polyamide 610 with the aim of improving latent heat and melting temperature to meet the demanding requirements of high-temperature heat storage applications using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The results clarify the critical impact of reaction times, washing solvents, and molar ratios on these vital thermal characteristics. Samples exhibiting exceptional latent heat capacities at various mole ratios were further analyzed using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The TGA assessments were instrumental in determining the thermal degradation behaviors of the materials. At the same time, The DSC analysis was used for the determination of thermal properties of the materials, FTIR provided detailed insights into their molecular structures, and XRD elucidated the crystalline structure of the materials. The findings reveal that a specific mole ratio is essential for achieving superior thermal properties, indicative of the polymer's resilience and structural stability. It was evident that samples with a balanced molar ratio (1:1) and specific reaction time (60 min) showed the best latent heat, surpassing 80 J g-1, and melting temperatures up to 210 °C. A notable aspect of this research is the use of Sebacic Acid instead of the conventional Sebacoyl Chloride for synthesizing polyamide 610. The choice of Sebacic Acid was made due to its lower toxicity and the fact that its byproducts are easier to remove than those from sebacoyl chloride, which produces hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The presence of HCL can lead to side reactions and negatively impact the reaction process. By using Sebacic Acid, we reduce the risk of such contaminants, thereby enhancing the thermal stability and performance of polyamide 610. This greener approach not only aligns with sustainable practices but also has significant implications for the performance of the polymer. In addition, the integration of RSM with comprehensive characterization techniques has been pivotal in elucidating the critical influence of synthesis parameters on material properties. This enhanced understanding holds the potential for significant contributions to the development of advanced materials for latent heat storage applications, combining sustainability with high performance.
