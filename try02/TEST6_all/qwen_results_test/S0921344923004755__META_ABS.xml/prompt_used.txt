You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Technical and environmental assessment of end-of-life scenarios for plastic packaging with electronic tags The end-of-life management of plastics is challenging, especially when inefficient sorting can limit the quality of recycling streams. Radio frequency identification device (RFID) tags can add value to packaging by assisting with post-collection sorting and end-of-life management. We conducted, for the first time, a technical and environmental (LCA) evaluation of plastic packaging with RFID for different end-of-life scenarios, including mechanical recycling (extrusion), chemical recycling (depolymerisation), and energy-from-waste. The recycling process and plastic quality were unaffected by the RFID, although tag particulates can be transferred to the recyclate. LCA results indicated that mechanical recycling of the plastic with either energy-from-waste treatment (Scenario 1) or chemical recycling (Scenario 3) of the RFID is superior to chemical recycling of the plastic and RFID (Scenario 2) among all the impact categories except stratospheric ozone depletion potential. For example, the global warming potential of Scenario 2 (223.63 gCO2e) was determined to be more than twice than that of the Scenarios 1 and 3 (111.04 and 111.78 gCO2e, respectively). However, as per sensitivity analysis, with further advancements particularly in catalyst development and energy mix, chemical recycling can be a potential solution as it ensures the highest recyclate quality and facilitates the longest retention of the material value. The growing application of RFID tags in consumer goods makes the technical and environmental investigation of its effects on the end-of-life management paramount.
