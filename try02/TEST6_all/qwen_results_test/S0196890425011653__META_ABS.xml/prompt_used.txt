You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solar pyro-gasification of biomass: modelling the influence of moisture content and sample height A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics model was developed to analyse the solar pyro-gasification of thermally thick biomass particles, with particular emphasis on the effects of initial moisture content and sample height on product yields and syngas composition. The model incorporates moisture evaporation, primary pyrolysis reactions, secondary tar cracking, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous gasification reactions. Kinetic parameters for secondary tar cracking reactions were derived using Reactive Molecular Dynamics simulations, improving the accuracy of reaction kinetics predictions at high temperatures. The model was successfully validated against experimental data available in the literature for various final temperatures (800–1600 °C) and heating rates (10 and 50 °C/s). Results demonstrated that higher moisture content promoted steam reforming reactions and increased the syngas yield, particularly hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), while also significantly influencing the pyrolysis kinetics and product distribution. Also, increased sample height intensified intra-particle secondary reactions due to extended residence times, impacting both gas yields and compositions. This model represents a significant step forward in understanding and optimizing the solar pyrolysis process for thermally thick biomass particles.
