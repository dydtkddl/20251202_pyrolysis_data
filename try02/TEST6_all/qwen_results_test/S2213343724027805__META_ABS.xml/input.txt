The effect of chlorides on heavy metal removal and phosphorus transformation during phytoremediation residue pyrolysis In contrast to the stabilization strategy that ignores the limitation of heavy metal concentration on biochar utilization, the present study attempts to resource phytoremediation residue into heavy metal-free biochar through the coupling of pyrolysis and chlorination. The results showed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature and the amount of chlorinating agent facilitated the removal of heavy metals and the conversion of phosphorus to bioavailable phosphorus in the biochar, with the removal efficiency of Zn reaching 99.60 % and the bioavailability-P fraction increasing to 89.52 %. In addition, the added PVC expanded organic matter content in biochar and enhanced its stability, but impaired its alkalinity and textural structure. The results of leaching tests and risk assessment indicated that the residual heavy metals in generated biochar were environmentally acceptable and even met the requirements for soil amendment. The study demonstrates that heavy metals enriched in phytoremediation residue can be separated by pyrolysis. It is possible to obtain heavy metal worry-free biochar while recovering valuable trace elements, which opens the way for the treatment of such hazardous wastes.
