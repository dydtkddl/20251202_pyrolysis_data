You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of chlorides on heavy metal removal and phosphorus transformation during phytoremediation residue pyrolysis In contrast to the stabilization strategy that ignores the limitation of heavy metal concentration on biochar utilization, the present study attempts to resource phytoremediation residue into heavy metal-free biochar through the coupling of pyrolysis and chlorination. The results showed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature and the amount of chlorinating agent facilitated the removal of heavy metals and the conversion of phosphorus to bioavailable phosphorus in the biochar, with the removal efficiency of Zn reaching 99.60 % and the bioavailability-P fraction increasing to 89.52 %. In addition, the added PVC expanded organic matter content in biochar and enhanced its stability, but impaired its alkalinity and textural structure. The results of leaching tests and risk assessment indicated that the residual heavy metals in generated biochar were environmentally acceptable and even met the requirements for soil amendment. The study demonstrates that heavy metals enriched in phytoremediation residue can be separated by pyrolysis. It is possible to obtain heavy metal worry-free biochar while recovering valuable trace elements, which opens the way for the treatment of such hazardous wastes.
