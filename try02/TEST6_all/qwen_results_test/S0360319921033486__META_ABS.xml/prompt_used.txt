You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydro-catalytic treatment of organoamine boranes for efficient thermal dehydrogenation for hydrogen production This study aims to present the hydro-catalytic treatment of organoamine boranes for efficient thermal dehydrogenation for hydrogen production. Organoamine boranes, methylamine borane (MeAB), and ethane 1,2 diamine borane (EDAB), known as ammonia borane (AB) carbon derivatives, are synthesized to be used as a solid-state hydrogen storage medium. Thermal dehydrogenation of MeAB and EDAB is performed at 80 °C, 100 °C, and 120 °C under different conditions (self, catalytic, and hydro-catalytic) for hydrogen production and compared with AB. For this purpose, a cobalt-doped activated carbon (Co-AC) catalyst is fabricated. The physicochemical properties of Co-AC catalyst is investigated by well-known techniques such as ATR/FT-IR, XRD, XPS, ICP-MS, BET, and TEM. The synthesized Co-AC catalyst obtained in nano CoOOH structure (20 nm, 12% Co wt) is formed and well-dispersed on the activated carbon support. It has indicated that Co-AC exhibits efficient catalytic activity towards organoamine boranes thermal dehydrogenation. Hydrogen release tests show that hydro-catalytic treatment improves the thermal dehydrogenation kinetics of neat MeAB, EDAB, and AB. Co-AC catalyzed hydro-treatment for thermal dehydrogenation of MeAB and EDAB acceleras the hydrogen release from 0.13 mL H2/min to 46.12 mL H2/min, from 0.16 mL H2/min to 38.06 mL H2/min, respectively at 80 °C. Moreover, hydro-catalytic treatment significantly lowers the H2 release barrier of organoamine boranes thermal dehydrogenation, from 110 kJ/mol to 19 kJ/mol for MeAB and 130 kJ/mol to 21 kJ/mol for EDAB. In conclusion, hydro and catalytic treatment presents remarkable synergistic effect in thermal dehydrogenation and improves the hydrogen release kinetics.
