Towards sustainable electronics: Advances in flexible supercapacitors for energy storage applications The emergence of ultra-thin electronic devices and the growing demand for human-centric designs have propelled the development of wearable flexible micro-devices. However, the technology for applying electrode materials to flexible substrates remains in its infancy. In today's landscape of zero-pollution energy devices, lightweight formulations and adaptable shapes are crucial for meeting the current needs of wearables. Flexible supercapacitors are particularly attractive for many new devices, offering advantages over traditional supercapacitors, such as improved safety, reduced weight, compact size, and environmental sustainability. As a result, flexible supercapacitors hold significant potential for smart, wearable, and portable electronic devices. In this review, we explore recent advancements in the fabrication of flexible, self-sustaining supercapacitors, including innovations in materials—from conventional carbons to newly developed nanomaterials for lightweight, stretchable active components in flexible wearable supercapacitors. We also discuss fabrication techniques and new flexible substrates, as well as the challenges and benefits of developing flexible, self-supporting electrodes for supercapacitors and other electronic devices.
