Valorization of waste neem seeds for biochar and bio-oil production: Optimization and statistical analysis This study investigates the pyrolytic conversion of neem seeds, an underutilized biomass, into bio-oil and biochar using a fixed-bed reactor, aimed at enhancing renewable energy sources. The research focuses on optimizing three key operational parameter's reaction temperature (300–450 °C), pyrolysis duration (20–60 min), and zeolite catalyst dosage (6–14 %) to assess their impact on bio-oil and biochar yields. Proximate and ultimate analysis were conducted to characterize the neem seed biomass, with statistical models validating the relationship between these parameters and yield efficiency. Results demonstrated that temperature and reaction time had the most significant influence, achieving peak bio-oil and biochar yields of 36.5 % and 46.0 %, respectively, at optimal conditions of 375 °C, 20–40 min, and a 10 % catalyst load. Statistical validation affirmed the strong correlation between the variables and the product yields. Furthermore, neem biochar showed a considerable heating value of 18.7 MJ/kg, indicating its potential as an efficient energy source. These findings underscore the viability of neem seeds in sustainable energy applications and present avenues for optimizing biofuel production.
