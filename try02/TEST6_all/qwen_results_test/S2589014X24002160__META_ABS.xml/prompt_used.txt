You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of waste neem seeds for biochar and bio-oil production: Optimization and statistical analysis This study investigates the pyrolytic conversion of neem seeds, an underutilized biomass, into bio-oil and biochar using a fixed-bed reactor, aimed at enhancing renewable energy sources. The research focuses on optimizing three key operational parameter's reaction temperature (300–450 °C), pyrolysis duration (20–60 min), and zeolite catalyst dosage (6–14 %) to assess their impact on bio-oil and biochar yields. Proximate and ultimate analysis were conducted to characterize the neem seed biomass, with statistical models validating the relationship between these parameters and yield efficiency. Results demonstrated that temperature and reaction time had the most significant influence, achieving peak bio-oil and biochar yields of 36.5 % and 46.0 %, respectively, at optimal conditions of 375 °C, 20–40 min, and a 10 % catalyst load. Statistical validation affirmed the strong correlation between the variables and the product yields. Furthermore, neem biochar showed a considerable heating value of 18.7 MJ/kg, indicating its potential as an efficient energy source. These findings underscore the viability of neem seeds in sustainable energy applications and present avenues for optimizing biofuel production.
