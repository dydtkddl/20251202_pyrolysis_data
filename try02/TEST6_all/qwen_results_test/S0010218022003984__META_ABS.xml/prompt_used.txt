You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative insights into flue gas-to-ash characteristics on co-combustion of walnut shell and bio-oil distillation sludge under atmospheric and oxy-fuel condition The clean recovery of bio-oil distillation sludge (DS) is a pivotal sector to perfect the biomass refinery system in responses to effective waste management and environmentally friendly consensus. This work aimed to comparatively characterize atmospheric and oxy-fuel co-combustion of walnut shell (WS) and DS in terms of (co-)combustion performance, distributed kinetics, flue gas evolution and ash characteristics. The results indicated co-combustion of WS and DS significantly increased the allocated proportion of char combustion stage and improved co-combustion performance, which was reflected in the enhanced four quantitative combustion indices. The fourth pseudo component, corresponded to the char combustion stage, continuously dominated the whole combustion process by adding more fraction of DS to co-combust with WS, whose activation energy was diminished, thereby optimizing the initial reaction energy barrier. In addition, oxy-fuel combustion promoted the recovery and sequestration of CO2, facilitated the formation of CO, and further endowed the conversion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into phenols rather than aromatics. Although the composition for mixed molten ash presented the decreased contents for easy-slagging minerals, the co-combustion process was still with potential ash fouling risk owing to basically unchanged ash configuration consistent with WS ash. However, the addition of DS to some extent strengthened anti-slagging performance, consequently optimizing the empirical indices of slagging and fouling for mixed ashes. Also, a higher ash content was yielded in oxy-fuel combustion than that in atmospheric combustion owing to the reducibility of CO2, in which the presence of CO2 contributed to the formations of carbonates and low melting-temperature potassium-containing silicates.
