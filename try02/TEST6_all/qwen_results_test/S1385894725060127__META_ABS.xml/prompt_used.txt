You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tin-based alloys for advanced lithium/sodium storage: Fabrication designs, optimization strategies and fundamental mechanisms Tin (Sn) is considered as a promising anode material for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity (994 and 847 mAh g−1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively), moderate working potential (0.3–0.6 V), superior conductivity, and abundant resources. However, the significant volume expansion (∼260% and 420% for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) and the coarsening issues of Sn result in poor cyclic stability, which severely restricts the application. Alloying Sn with various metals to construct Sn-based alloys (MSn x , M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Sb, etc.) is a widely used method to buffer volume expansion and inhibit Sn coarsening in order to improve cycling performance. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent advances in the research into MSn x alloys for advanced lithium/sodium storage, including fabrication, optimization and mechanisms. Four viable synthesis approaches of MSn x from M and Sn ions or metal particles are presented, i.e., chemical reduction, ball milling, electrochemical deposition, and calcination. Four efficient enhancement strategies and their fundamental mechanisms are proposed, i.e., nano size control, designing porous/hollow structures, compositing with carbon, and constructing array architectures. Nanostructured MSn x can reduce the volume expansion and shorten the ion transport distance. Compositing MSn x with carbon can buffer the volume stress and improve the conductivity. Constructing porous and hollow structured MSn x can strengthen the structural robustness and promote electrolyte infiltration. Establishing array architectured MSn x can accommodate the volume changes and maintain electrode structural integrity. Finally, the future prospects and challenges of MSn x anodes are highlighted which will provide valuable insights for the rational design of next-generation LIBs/SIBs and facilitate their practical application development.
