You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation and optimization of the gasification parameters of macadamia nutshells in a batch-fed bubbling fluidized bed gasifier with air preheating Gasification of biomass waste has a significant potential to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainability by producing syngas, which is considered as renewable energy. This work investigated the gasification of macadamia nutshells in air-preheated, batch-fed fluidized bed gasifier. The study conducted a parametric analysis to assess the effect of equivalence ratio (ER) and air temperature on the gasifier temperature profile and its performance based on gas composition, higher heating value (HHV), and gas yield. The research was conducted within the range of 0.15–0.35 for the ER and 25–825 °C for the air temperature. Multi-objective numerical optimization was conducted using response surface methodology (RSM). From the parametric study, a distinct temperature profile was observed along the gasifier height, with the peak temperature near the top of the fluidized bed section and the lowest temperature at the top of the gasifier. Air preheating mostly favored gasification temperature at the lower part of the gasifier and showed rare significance at the top. No improvement in gasifier performance was observed beyond an air temperature of 620 °C, which was identified as the ideal air-preheating temperature. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the ER was the most influential parameter in the production of combustible gasses, syngas HHV and gas yield. Air preheating did not have a significant effect on methane production and gas yield. The most optimal values for ER and air temperature were obtained as 0.195 °C and 620 °C, respectively, producing optimal values of 9.54, 14.65%, 2.03, 4.02 MJ·Nm−3, and 1.82 Nm3·kg−1 for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, HHV, and gas yield, respectively.
