You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of coffee-grounds and waste polystyrene foam: Synergistic effect and product characteristics analysis Coffee-grounds (CFs) are simultaneously pyrolyzed with waste polystyrene foam (PS) in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor according to the following conditions: a temperature of 500 °C selected from the thermogravimetric analyses of CFs and PS, the nitrogen flow rate of about 20–25 L/min., and the feeding rate of 200 g/h. Multiple CFs/PS mixing ratios were treated as follows: 75:25, 50:50, 25:75. The properties, the chemical compositions of the co-pyrolysis oils and the yields of the products were compared with those of the pyrolysis-oils of the individual feedstocks to demonstrate the synergy between the CFs and the PS. The synergy with the co-pyrolysis produced a higher liquid yield than the calculated amount. The higher heating value of co-pyrolysis oils increased to 39.66 MJ/kg, which was equivalent to that of conventional fuels. Blending at least 25% of PS to CFs could greatly reduce the viscosity of CFs pyrolysis oil (from 724.65cP to 29.3cP at 24 °C). Chemical distributions have shown that the synergy effect between CFs and PS has drastically enhanced the production of hydrocarbons, especially in aromatic compounds.
