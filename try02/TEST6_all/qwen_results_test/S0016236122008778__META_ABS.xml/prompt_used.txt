You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste cooking oil biodiesel and petroleum diesel soot from diesel bus: A comparison of morphology, nanostructure, functional group composition and oxidation reactivity Biodiesel is one of carbon neutral fuels for diesel engine and waste cooking oil (WCO) would be the most viable source for biodiesel production in China. This paper studied the micromorphology, nanostructure, surface functional group composition, and oxidation activity characteristics of particles emitted from a China V bus fueled by pure WCO biodiesel and petroleum diesel, respectively. Compared with petroleum diesel, the results showed that particle mass (PM) and particle number (PN) of WCO biodiesel decreased by 38.66% and 38.12%, respectively, while the proportion of nucleation mode particles increased by about 10%. The soot particles of WCO biodiesel have higher disordered nanostructure, smaller primary particle size and fringe length, larger fringe separation distance and tortuosity, and lower graphitization degree than those of petroleum diesel. Moreover, the oxygen-containing surface functional groups content and carbon atom hybrid ratio of soot particles of WCO biodiesel were higher than those of petroleum diesel under the same oxidation temperature. And then the activation energy of soot particles from WCO biodiesel which contained more lattice defect structures was 38.43 kJ/mol, 37.8% lower than petroleum diesel, which is easier to be oxidized.
