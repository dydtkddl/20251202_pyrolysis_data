You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Uncovering the differences: A comparison of properties of crude plastic pyrolytic oil and distilled and hydrotreated plastic diesel produced from waste and virgin plastics as automobile fuels Thermal pyrolysis of mixed waste plastics (MWP) and mixed virgin plastics (MVP) containing high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) at 1:1:1 ratio were performed in a 20L pyrolytic pilot-scale batch reactor. The pyrolysis was conducted at 540 °C temperature and atmospheric pressure for 6 h. The properties of the produced crude plastic pyrolytic oil (CPPO or crude PPO), such as higher heating value (HHV), cetane index, lubricity, flash point, etc, obtained by pyrolysis of MWP, and MVP samples, confirmed that the oil was not suitable for direct use as an automobile fuel. Therefore, CPPO was further refined by vacuum distillation to match the properties of standard diesel more closely, herein referred as distilled plastic diesel (DPD). Some of the properties of DPD did not meet the standard diesel criteria, which is why DPD was further refined through a hydrotreatment process to ensure it was directly comparable to standard diesel, herein referred as hydrotreated plastic diesel (HPD). The fuel properties of all crude PPO, DPD and HPD were analysed and compared to standard (consumer) diesel according to Australian, ASTM and EN standards to assess their suitability as automobile fuel. With the aid of a 20L pyrolizer and a pilot-scale distillation and hydrotreatment plant, this comprehensive study demonstrated the importance of distillation and hydrotreatment for CPPO and found that DPD and HPD are well suited for use as drop-in diesel fuels. The results signify that with the right choice in refining technologies, waste plastics can be used as a source of automobile fuel.
