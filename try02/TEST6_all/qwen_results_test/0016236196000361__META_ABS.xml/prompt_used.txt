You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocracking of solvolysis lignin in a batch reactor A prototype organosolv lignin was hydrocracked at temperatures of 370–410°C in the presence of tetralin, a hydrogen donor solvent. The effects of temperature and time were combined into a single severity parameter that was used to monitor the conversion of lignin to liquid and gaseous products as well as the distribution of important liquid products. A nickel-tungsten catalyst was used in most of this work. At the highest severity of treatment, conversion of lignin did not exceed 50 wt%. The high yields of either reactor residue (at low severity) or residual lignin (at high severity) suggest that the reaction conditions used were not sufficient to degrade the lignin to liquid and gaseous products. The distribution of liquid monomeric compounds was too wide and their yields were too low to warrant complete identification and quantification by capillary gas chromatography. However, from the relative abundance of representative peaks in the chromatograms of acetylated compounds in the dichloromethane-solubles, syringols and guaiacols predominated at low severities of reaction. At high treatment severities, demethoxylated compounds (phenols, catechols and their methyl and ethyl derivatives) were the major liquid products. The addition of nickel-tungsten heterogeneous catalysts with either low (3 wt%) or high (60 wt%) Ni content only marginally improved the yields of monomeric phenolic compounds. However, much higher gas yields were produced when using the 60 wt% Ni catalyst.
