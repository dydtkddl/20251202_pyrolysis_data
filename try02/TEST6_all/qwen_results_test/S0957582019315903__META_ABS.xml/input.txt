Flame suppression of 100 nm PMMA dust explosion by KHCO3 with different particle size Flame suppression mechanism of KHCO3 for 100nm PMMA dust explosions was investigated experimentally and computationally. The effect of KHCO3 particle size on the suppression efficiency was examined. The study revealed that the larger the proportion of added KHCO3, the more significant the suppression effect on flame, for KHCO3 particles with a fixed particle size distribution. The suppression effects were significantly increased with the decreasing of KHCO3 particle size distributions. For endothermic mechanism, when the KHCO3 particles with three particle sizes were mixed with 100nm PMMA, the heat absorption peaks exhibited at the initial stage, in which the heat absorption values were 28J/g, 26J/g and 21J/g, respectively. A kinetics model was established to reveal the chemical suppression mechanism. It was presented that the mole fractions of key flame radicals (H and OH) were obviously reduced during the chain reaction processes with the addition of KHCO3. For KHCO3 particles, the formation of catalytic cycle K ⇔ KOH converted H and OH radicals into a stable combustion product H2O, resulting in a lower flame speed and flame temperature.
