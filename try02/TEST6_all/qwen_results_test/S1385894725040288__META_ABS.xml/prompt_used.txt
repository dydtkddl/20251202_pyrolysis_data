You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding the role of plastic additives in the pyrolysis of plastic wastes: Impact of additives on product selectivity, kinetics, and mechanistic pathways Pyrolysis offers a promising solution to converting plastic waste into high-value products. However, the impact and mechanism of plastic additives in regulating the pyrolysis of different plastic types remain unclear. To address this gap, this study first investigates the differences in structure, thermal stability, and decomposition kinetics of five common chlorine-free plastics and their corresponding virgin polymers. Subsequently, microwave catalytic pyrolysis is employed as the core methodology to analyze the distribution and composition of pyrolysis products under a fixed condition (microwave power of 800 W and a plastic-to-HZSM-5 catalyst ratio of 8:3). The results indicate that Na2SO4 and CaCO3 are the main additives used in HDPE and PP plastics. Na2SO4, with a higher thermal conductivity than HDPE, enhances heat transfer, resulting in a faster pyrolysis rate for shopping bags (HDPE plastic). CaCO3 adsorbs intermediates formed during the pyrolysis of water pipes (HDPE plastic), altering the reaction pathway and promoting chain scission. Consequently, monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) increase in shopping bags and water pipes, with relative contents of 81.51 % and 79.96 % in liquid oil, respectively, compared to 67.99 % in virgin HDPE. Conversely, the highly branched structure of PP leads CaCO3 to promote cross-linking reactions during the pyrolysis of woven bags (PP plastic), resulting in macromolecular formation. This increases activation energy and decreases the MAH relative content in the pyrolysis products. The variations in pyrolysis characteristics between LDPE, PS, and PET plastics and their polymers are primarily attributed to differences in morphology, impacting the pyrolysis rate and degree of molecular chain breakage.
