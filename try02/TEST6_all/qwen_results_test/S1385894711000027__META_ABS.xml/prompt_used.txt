You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Manufacture of fibrous reinforcements for biocomposites and hemicellulosic oligomers from bamboo Autohydrolysis of bamboo (treatments with hot, compressed water) resulted in liquors containing mainly hemicellulose-derived products (oligo- and mono-saccharides), and in spent solids (enriched in cellulose and lignin) with potential utility as a reinforcement for composites. Autohydrolysis of bamboo was carried out under a variety of operational conditions, and the resulting solid and liquid phases were assayed for composition. Kinetic models (based on pseudo-homogeneous, first-order, and irreversible reactions) were developed for data interpretation. Under selected conditions, 62.6% of the initial hemicelluloses present in the raw material were converted into oligosaccharides. The solid phase from the treatment leading to the maximal concentration of oligomeric compounds derived from hemicelluloses was employed as a fibrous reinforcement for polylactic acid (PLA)-based biocomposites. For comparative purposes, other three types of reinforcements from bamboo were also employed for making PLA-based composites: bamboo flour, short bamboo fibers, and large bamboo fibers. Compared to neat PLA, reinforcement with bamboo-derived materials resulted in increased stiffness and lower strain at break, whereas little effects were caused in tensile strength. Additional information on thermal analysis and surface morphological characteristics of biocomposites is also provided.
