  "pyrolysis_related": "YES",
  "reason": "The study involves catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene) with measurable product yields (over 10 wt.% carbon deposits), characterized CNTs with defined dimensions, and temperature-dependent performance, indicating lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
