You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-Value Utilization of Waste Plastics: Transforming Plastic Polymers into Thin-Walled and Uniform Carbon Nanotubes via Catalytic Pyrolysis The high-value utilization of waste plastics plays a crucial role in mitigating plastic pollution. In this work, transition metals were selected as active species, while magnesium oxide, derived from the calcination of basic magnesium carbonate, served as the support material for the generation of thin-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The confined pore structure restricts the migration of reduced iron nanoparticles, promoting the nucleation and growth of small-diameter and thin-walled CNTs. The results show that over 10 wt.% carbon deposits were collected from various types of plastics. The CNTs generated from polyethylene exhibit a diameter of approximately 8 nm and a wall thickness of about 6 layers of graphite. Additionally, Ni-based and Co-based catalysts, polypropylene and polystyrene have also been studied and around 10 nm CNTs were produced. Moreover, this study further demonstrates that excessively high or low temperatures are detrimental to the growth of CNTs. To sum up, this work proposes a novel strategy for recycling waste plastics into smaller-diameters CNTs, offering significant potential for the high-value utilization of waste.
