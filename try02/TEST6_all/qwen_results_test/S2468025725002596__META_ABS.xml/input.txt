High-Value Utilization of Waste Plastics: Transforming Plastic Polymers into Thin-Walled and Uniform Carbon Nanotubes via Catalytic Pyrolysis The high-value utilization of waste plastics plays a crucial role in mitigating plastic pollution. In this work, transition metals were selected as active species, while magnesium oxide, derived from the calcination of basic magnesium carbonate, served as the support material for the generation of thin-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The confined pore structure restricts the migration of reduced iron nanoparticles, promoting the nucleation and growth of small-diameter and thin-walled CNTs. The results show that over 10 wt.% carbon deposits were collected from various types of plastics. The CNTs generated from polyethylene exhibit a diameter of approximately 8 nm and a wall thickness of about 6 layers of graphite. Additionally, Ni-based and Co-based catalysts, polypropylene and polystyrene have also been studied and around 10 nm CNTs were produced. Moreover, this study further demonstrates that excessively high or low temperatures are detrimental to the growth of CNTs. To sum up, this work proposes a novel strategy for recycling waste plastics into smaller-diameters CNTs, offering significant potential for the high-value utilization of waste.
