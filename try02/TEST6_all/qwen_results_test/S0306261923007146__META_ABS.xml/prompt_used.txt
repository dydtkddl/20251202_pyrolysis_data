You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in plastic waste pyrolysis for liquid fuel production: Critical factors and machine learning applications It is urgent to promote the technology development of plastic waste (PW) valorization to mitigate the present serious plastic pollution. Pyrolysis has been widely used to convert PW into high-value-added products, especially liquid fuels, in a sustainable manner. However, achieving a high yield of liquid fuel with good quality remains challenging due to the difficulty in optimizing pyrolysis process and synthesizing outstanding catalysts to narrow the product distribution. This work comprehensively reviewed PW pyrolysis from both technical and computational (machine learning modeling) aspects, with a critical discussion of recent challenges to find new insights for improving the conversion efficiency and promoting commercialization. Results indicated that the impacts of various factors, including PW type, process condition, catalyst, and reactor type, on the PW pyrolysis were extensively investigated by the research community. Machine learning methods have also been frequently applied to predict, interpret, and optimize the PW pyrolysis. However, more efforts can be made in the future regarding catalyst synthesis, selection of co-pyrolysis additives, mechanism of catalyst deactivation, and design of renewable energy supply system for PW pyrolysis plants. Additionally, more attention should be paid to enlarging the data size, improving model interpretability, and exploring innovative ways of machine learning application (e.g., active learning) in process optimization and catalyst design for PW pyrolysis.
