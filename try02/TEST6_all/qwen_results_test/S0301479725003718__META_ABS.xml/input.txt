Analysis of biological treatment technologies, their present infrastructures and suitability for biodegradable food packaging - A review Recently, there has been an increased demand for biodegradable plastics in the food packaging industry, especially for highly food soiled packaging items containing food/beverage solids that will not be recycled using a non-biological process. However, the increased usage of those materials have also raised concerns and confusion, as a major part of these biodegradable plastics are not effectively separated nor recycled. The lack of acceptance in recycling facilities, related to confusion with their conventional polymers counterparts, as well as short retention times of recycling facilities, often incompatible with the degradation kinetics of biodegradable plastics, stand as the major drawbacks for bioplastics treatment. Additionally, the presence of incompletely biodegraded bioplastics during biological treatments or in the final products i.e. compost or digestate, could lead to process failure or limit the commercialization of the compost. This work critically reviews the fundamentals of the biological treatments, anaerobic digestion and composting processes, and discusses the current strategies to improve their performance. In addition, this work summarizes the state-of-the-art knowledge and the impact of bioplastics on full-scale treatment plants. Finally, an overview of the current installed treatment capacity is given to show the areas of opportunity that can be improved and exploited to achieve a better waste management of biodegradable plastics.
