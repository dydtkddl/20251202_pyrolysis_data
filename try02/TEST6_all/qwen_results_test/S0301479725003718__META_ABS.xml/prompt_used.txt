You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of biological treatment technologies, their present infrastructures and suitability for biodegradable food packaging - A review Recently, there has been an increased demand for biodegradable plastics in the food packaging industry, especially for highly food soiled packaging items containing food/beverage solids that will not be recycled using a non-biological process. However, the increased usage of those materials have also raised concerns and confusion, as a major part of these biodegradable plastics are not effectively separated nor recycled. The lack of acceptance in recycling facilities, related to confusion with their conventional polymers counterparts, as well as short retention times of recycling facilities, often incompatible with the degradation kinetics of biodegradable plastics, stand as the major drawbacks for bioplastics treatment. Additionally, the presence of incompletely biodegraded bioplastics during biological treatments or in the final products i.e. compost or digestate, could lead to process failure or limit the commercialization of the compost. This work critically reviews the fundamentals of the biological treatments, anaerobic digestion and composting processes, and discusses the current strategies to improve their performance. In addition, this work summarizes the state-of-the-art knowledge and the impact of bioplastics on full-scale treatment plants. Finally, an overview of the current installed treatment capacity is given to show the areas of opportunity that can be improved and exploited to achieve a better waste management of biodegradable plastics.
