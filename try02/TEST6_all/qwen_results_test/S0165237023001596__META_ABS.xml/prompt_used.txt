You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction of three-phase product yield of biomass pyrolysis using artificial intelligence-based models Further efforts are still needed to refine and optimise complex thermochemical pyrolysis processes crucial in waste management and clean energy production. In this work, a comparative artificial intelligence (AI) based modelling study is conducted using four supervised machine learning models, including artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) to predict the three-phase product yields of pyrolysis. The models were trained using a database of previous experiments focused on continuous pyrolysis in fluidised bed reactors, with biomass feedstock characteristics and pyrolysis conditions as input features. A reactor dimension parameter through H/D (the ratio of the reactor height, H and the reactor diameter, D), for the first time, is also included as an input feature. The models are optimised through feature reduction and 5-fold cross-validation hyperparameter tuning. They show that reducing the organic composition of biomass to include only chemical composition results in the best feature-reduced model. After the comparison of performance scores and total feature importance, the general ranking for AI model accuracy for this study is XGB>RF>ANN>SVR. The H/D ratio also has the highest feature importance scores of 21.71% and 29.52% in predicting the oil and gas yield of the feature-reduced XGB model, confirming the importance of this added parameter. Preliminary contour plot analysis of the database shows that for the considered reactors, optimum oil yields are obtained at H/D ratio< 5, while the optimum gas yields are expected at H/D ratioc closer to 10 for fluidised bed reactors as another indicator of factor importance.
