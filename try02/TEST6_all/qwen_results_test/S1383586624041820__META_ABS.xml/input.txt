A comprehensive evaluation of recent advancement in municipal solid waste gasification: Research status, technical challenges and Perspectives Gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an essential technology for effective waste management and energy recovery. The various components of MSW, specifically the regional and seasonal variability in kitchen waste and the chlorine in plastic waste, have negatively impact on the stability and homogeneity of gasification. This review reviews the gasification characteristics of municipal solid waste components and examines methods to enhance gas output, stability, and safety. The interaction effect between plastic and other waste benefits H2 production during the co-gasification, and steam is better than air and CO2 as the agent for the plastic gasification. A comparative analysis of fixed-bed, fluidized bed and dual-stage gasifiers is presented, emphasizing their efficiency, cost, pollution control, and technical challenges, including tar formation and chlorine removal. Dual-stage gasifiers are good at tar reduction and enhancing syngas quality, and easily combined with CO2/Cl capture technologies. Recent achievements, such as plasma and supercritical gasification, provide potential alternatives to these challenges by improving gasification performance. The innovative strategy of combining advanced MSW gasification with carbon capture/Cl fixation are also discussed. This study intends to provide significant insights and encourage future developments in the area of MSW gasification, thereby enhancing waste management methods in terms of efficiency and sustainability.
