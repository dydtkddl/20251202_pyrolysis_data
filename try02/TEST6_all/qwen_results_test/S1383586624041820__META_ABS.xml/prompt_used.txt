You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive evaluation of recent advancement in municipal solid waste gasification: Research status, technical challenges and Perspectives Gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an essential technology for effective waste management and energy recovery. The various components of MSW, specifically the regional and seasonal variability in kitchen waste and the chlorine in plastic waste, have negatively impact on the stability and homogeneity of gasification. This review reviews the gasification characteristics of municipal solid waste components and examines methods to enhance gas output, stability, and safety. The interaction effect between plastic and other waste benefits H2 production during the co-gasification, and steam is better than air and CO2 as the agent for the plastic gasification. A comparative analysis of fixed-bed, fluidized bed and dual-stage gasifiers is presented, emphasizing their efficiency, cost, pollution control, and technical challenges, including tar formation and chlorine removal. Dual-stage gasifiers are good at tar reduction and enhancing syngas quality, and easily combined with CO2/Cl capture technologies. Recent achievements, such as plasma and supercritical gasification, provide potential alternatives to these challenges by improving gasification performance. The innovative strategy of combining advanced MSW gasification with carbon capture/Cl fixation are also discussed. This study intends to provide significant insights and encourage future developments in the area of MSW gasification, thereby enhancing waste management methods in terms of efficiency and sustainability.
