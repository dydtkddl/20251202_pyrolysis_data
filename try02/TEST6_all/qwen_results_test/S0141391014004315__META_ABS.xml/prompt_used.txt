You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of the composition of PMMA nanocomposites on gaseous effluents emitted during combustion This paper focuses on the nature of thermal degradation products formed by combustion of various PMMA nanocomposites and on the kinetics of emission of gases emitted during combustion. Compositions of two kinds of nanosilica and nanoalumina and their combinations with Ammonium PolyPhosphate (APP) in PMMA were prepared. Their thermal degradation was carried out using TGA coupled with FTIR and cone calorimeter. For the compositions of nanooxides, it appears that the kinetics of emission of gases is significantly influenced by the nature of oxide and by the surface treatment, but mainly for silica. Octylsilane modified silica combined with APP leads to an outstanding fire behaviour, due to the formation of a very cohesive and expanded layer containing silicon pyrophosphate, but at the expense of a higher CO emission and a measurable emission of HCN. Even if the presence of fire retardant (APP) and the incorporation of nanosilica with a surface treatment reduce the flammability, the high value of the CO yield could lead to the conclusion that the combination could improve toxicity. But, the nanocomposite based on silica surface treatment coupled with APP, induce a delay of the CO yield emission, which could allow people to evacuate buildings or houses in case of fire.
