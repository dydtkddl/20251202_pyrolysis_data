Co-pyrolysis of polymer waste and carbon-based matter as an alternative for waste management in the developing world Waste management is a challenging but necessary process to ensure efficient and healthy disposal of waste. The challenges are made worse by poor recording keeping and weak governmental policies. In this review, polymer co-pyrolysis is been explored as a sustainable waste management practice which allows for both energy and resource recovery in such conditions. It looks at current progress in co-pyrolysis of polymers and organics, and their potential to be utilised in the developing world. The review highlights gaps in which co-pyrolysis can be implemented in areas with limited polymer waste management policies and abundant organic resources. It looks at co-pyrolysis of polymers with different organics and links them to their availability.
