You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal liquefaction of diverse plastics using water and seawater In this study, a variety of plastics are converted to their monomers, fuel range hydrocarbons and other platform chemicals using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) at sub-critical (350 °C), near-critical (400 °C) and super-critical (450 °C) temperatures. The effect of seawater as a medium on the HTL of plastics is also studied. Polymers like polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), polyamides (PA-6, PA-66), and polyoxymethylene (POM) liquefied effectively at 350 °C, while polyolefins like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) required ≥ 400 °C. HTL of polystyrene (PS) resulted in the highest oil yield (93 wt%) and energy recovery from oil (93.5 %) at 450 °C. HTL of PC, PS and ABS led to the formation of phenols and benzene derivatives, while polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and PA-6 formed their monomers terephthalic acid and caprolactam, respectively. Crude oils from PP and PE contained fuel grade aliphatic hydrocarbons with carbon chain length ranging between C7 and C36. Highest calorific value was recorded for the oil from PP (46.3 MJ kg−1) at 400 °C. The use of seawater generally reduced the oil yields from all the plastics, except ABS, PET and PP. The production of benzoic acid from PET was enhanced, while the selectivity to caprolactam from PA-6 decreased when seawater was used, possibly due to the enhanced decarboxylation and aromatization reactions induced by the ions in the aqueous phase. In general, the crude oil from HTL of PC, PS, ABS and polyamides are suitable for sustainable production of specialty chemicals and monomers, while that from PE and PP are good candidates for sustainable transportation fuels.
