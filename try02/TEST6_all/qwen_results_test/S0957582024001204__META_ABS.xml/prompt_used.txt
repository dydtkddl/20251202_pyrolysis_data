You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring rice straw’s potential from a sustainable biorefinery standpoint: Towards valorization and diverse product production Due to population rise, the agriculture sector is creating a rising volume of process by-products of great commercial and nutritional value. The opportunity to decrease waste production while also upgrading the same into value-added chemicals and bio-derived products is provided by a biorefinery based on agricultural wastes such as rice straw (RS). Moreover, from an energy, environmental, and economic standpoint, RS is a resourceful agri-residue with potential of complete valorization and diverse product production capabilities. In this review, the potential of biorefineries is discussed, along with the value-added products that could be made from each of the three major structural components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) of RS and a brief description of the steps used to obtain them. The review's main goal is to succinctly illustrate how valuable and potentially beneficial RS is, as a bioresource for a variety of uses, including food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, bio-medicine, engineering, bio-fuels, and bio-energy. It also uniquely incorporates cost-benefit analysis of some of the RS bio-refineries in addition to the social and techno-economic aspects. Conclusively, the review would be insightful for scientific fraternity, academia, and industrialists to improve on current procedures or come up with fresh ideas for the sustainable management of RS or for any lignocellulosic biomass as well.
