You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and numerical study on the effects of coal on ammonia-N conversion behavior during ammonia-coal co-firing Co-firing ammonia with pulverized coal presents a promising strategy for reducing CO2 emissions in coal-fired power plants. However, there are concerns regarding the NOx formation behavior of ammonia. In this study, the effects of coal on ammonia-N (NH3-N) conversion behavior were explored by combustion experiments using a drop tube furnace, and the interactions between ammonia and coal were further analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The results showed that co-firing ammonia and coal/char could increase NOx formation, and the conversion ratio of fuel-N into NOx was also increased. The comparison of ammonia-coal and ammonia-char co-firing demonstrated that coal had a stronger effect on NH3-N conversion than char, further inferring that both char and volatile significantly increased the conversion of NH3-N to NOx. The simulation results suggested that 23.82% of the total NO emissions originated from coal, and 76.18% from ammonia in ammonia-coal co-firing, indicating that NH3-N was the primary source of the increased NOx, and the interactions between ammonia and coal/char increased the conversion of NH3-N to NOx. The interaction between coal (both volatile and char) and ammonia contributed to an overall increase in the ammonia average reaction rate, with the ammonia's average oxidation reaction rate displaying a much more pronounced increase. This further led to the formation of NOx and the conversion of NH3-N to NOx in ammonia-coal co-firing conditions.
