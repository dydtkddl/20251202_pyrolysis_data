You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodynamics of a novel biomass autothermal fast pyrolysis reactor: Solid circulation rate and gas bypassing A novel autothermal reactor, named internally interconnected fluidized beds (IIFB), was developed to convert biomass into liquid fuels and other valuable chemicals by fast pyrolysis. The IIFB reactor has a pyrolysis bed directly connected to a combustion bed to perform continuous and simultaneous operations of biomass pyrolysis and energy recovery from coke burning. The current study focuses on the hydrodynamics of the IIFB reactor, which can be used for identifying the optimal operating conditions for the complex biomass fast pyrolysis process. A visible plexiglass IIFB (internal diameter, 0.1m; height, 1.5m) system was built to investigate the flow behaviors of gas and solid in the reactor. The effects of spouting and fluidizing gas, static bed height, particle size and exit resistance on solid circulation rate and gas bypassing between the pyrolysis bed and combustion bed were studied. The results show that the solid circulation could be adjusted by changing spouting gas and fluidizing gas velocities. The highest solid circulation rate is about 121kg/m2 s (213.1kg/h). In addition, lower static bed height or smaller particle diameter leads to higher solid circulation rate, while lower resistance at pyrolysis bed outlet results in higher circulation rate. The gas bypassing characteristics has also been investigated. The results show that the gas bypassing fraction from combustion bed to pyrolysis bed can be controlled below 5%, while that from pyrolysis bed to combustion bed can be controlled below 15%.
