You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted biodiesel synthesis from waste cooking oil: Exploring the potential of carob pod-derived solid base catalyst This work examined the potency of carob (Ceratonia siliqua) pod as a heterogeneous base catalyst for converting waste cooking oil (WCO) into biodiesel via a microwave irradiation system. The optimal calcination for the catalyst synthesis was achieved at 500 °C for 4 h. Various analytical techniques were employed to investigate the properties of the developed catalyst. The results indicate that the catalyst primarily consists of mesoporous particles abundant in potassium, with medium to strong basic sites, which are crucial for its catalytic function. WCO underwent pretreatment with H2SO4 before being converted to biodiesel. Optimum conditions for the biodiesel production were a methanol-to-WCO molar ratio of 9.87, 1.00 wt% catalyst dosage, 3.03 min reaction time, 450 rpm stirring speed, and 600 W microwave power, yielding 98.20 ± 0.81 wt% biodiesel. The low specific energy consumption value of 0.91 kWh/kg and specific CO2 emission of 0.73 kg/kg of biodiesel suggest the effective utilization of microwave energy in driving the transesterification reaction and in promoting a reduction in carbon footprint, respectively. The synthesized catalyst remained effective up to the 5th production cycle and the biodiesel produced met established specifications. The results of this study show that carob pod is a suitable candidate to be included in the database of biobased catalysts currently being developed for heterogeneous catalysis of cost-effective biodiesel production.
