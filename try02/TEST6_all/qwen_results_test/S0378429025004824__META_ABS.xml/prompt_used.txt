You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biodegradable mulch enhances cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yield via microplastic reduction and P cycling microbes modulation Context Conventional mulch film (CMP) has been widely used to improve the productivity of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). However, due to CMP non-degradable characteristics, which damages the soil structure, harms the microbial community, and finally threatens the health of the entire soil ecosystem. Therefore, the demand for biodegradable mulch film (BMP) to replace CMP is increasing. Objective The effects of long-term use of BMP on soil phosphorus (P) and functional genes of P-cycle microorganisms remain unclear. We compared the long-term effects of CMP and BMP on microplastic residues and the structural diversity of P-cycling microorganisms in cotton fields. Methods Under both films, microplastics (MPs) types were polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride. Compared with CMP, BMP significantly reduced polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride contents. Results Under BMP, soil total P, inorganic (NaHCO3-Pi and D.HCl-Pi) and organic (NaHCO3-Po, NaOH-Po, and C.HCl-Po) P fractions, microbial biomass P, and labile, moderately labile, and stable P decreased significantly. However, cotton P uptake increased by 47 % and seed cotton yield by 4 % under BMP. Compared with CMP, BMP significantly increased alpha diversity of soil P-cycling microorganisms, while increasing abundance of Actinobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, Candidatus_Rokubacteria, Nocardioides, and Mesorhizobium in various P-cycling pathways and decreasing abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Sphingomonas, and Lysobacter. In addition, BMP downregulated the expression of key functional genes in organic P mineralization, regulatory, and inorganic P solubilization pathways. Partial least squares path model analysis indicated that MPs residues changed most P-cycling pathways. Correlation analysis indicated NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, and NaOH-Po were the key factors driving the expression of genes and enzymes of P-cycling microorganisms. Conclusions The BMP significantly reduced MPs residues and thereby altered the structure and expression of functional genes and enzymes of P-cycling microbial communities to ultimately increase cotton yield. Implications Our study show that biodegradable mulch alleviates MPs pollution and ultimately enhances crop productivity by promoting the function of the soil P-cycle.
