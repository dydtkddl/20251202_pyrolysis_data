You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A lumped kinetic model and experimental investigation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) condensed-phase pyrolysis In a circular economy perspective, plastic waste (PW) is a valuable source of chemicals and energy vectors. Understanding the effect of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) in thermochemical valorisation of complex and contaminated PW mixtures requires definition of suitable kinetic models. This work proposes a condensed-phase semi-detailed kinetic model for PET pyrolysis based on a consolidated functional group approach already validated for other polymers. The reaction network is built considering studies on thermal degradation of PET, model compounds, and small gas-phase esters. Reaction pathways proposed in the scientific literature are critically assessed through analogy with high accuracy gas-phase calculation and are complemented by new proposed pathways. The resulting model couples molecular and radical mechanism and consists of 85 gas and liquid species with 700 liquid-phase reactions, being suitable for CFD simulations of PW pyrolysis upon further reduction. This work also presents new experimental data including TG analysis coupled with GC × GC speciation measurements and elemental characterization of the solid residue. The model is validated by comparison with the new experimental data and a comprehensive set of literature data in terms of characteristic degradation times and detailed product yields. The present work expands the relevant data available for chemistry models development and extends the CRECK kinetic framework for thermochemical recycling of PW mixtures. The proposed kinetic model is attached as Supplementary material and freely available as an open GitHub repository.
