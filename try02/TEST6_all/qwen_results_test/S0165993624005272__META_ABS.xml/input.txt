Pushing the frontiers of micro/nano-plastic detection with portable instruments Micro/nano-plastics (MNPs) pollution is a significant environmental challenge with unclear health and ecological risks, necessitating real-time detection and monitoring across diverse environments. Increasing focus is being placed on developing portable, on-site detection methods to monitor the environment and mitigate plastic pollution. This review provides an overview of the principles and advancements in state-of-the-art portable instruments for real-world MNP detection, covering technologies such as spectroscopic instruments, electroanalysis with microfluidics, and mass spectrometry, while comparing their sensitivity, resolution, and suitability for different sample types. The review also addresses the challenges, including the complexity of environmental samples, nanoparticle detection, device miniaturization, and sophisticated data analysis requirements. Finally, it explores future directions, particularly integrating microfluidics with advanced sensing technologies, to enhance rapid environmental monitoring and pollution control. Our review aims to assist scientists in overcoming portable instrument limitations and encourage in designing miniaturized devices, thereby driving innovation in environmental monitoring and conservation.
