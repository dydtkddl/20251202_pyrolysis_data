You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient extraction of small microplastic particles from rat feed and feces for quantification To date, microplastic is ubiquitously encountered in the environment. Studies analyzing microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems, including animal feces and feed, are few. Microplastic quantification method validation and harmonization are not yet far developed. For the analysis of small microplastic, approximately <0.5 mm, extraction from organic and inorganic materials is fundamental prior to quantitative and qualitative analysis. Method validation, including recovery studies, are necessary throughout the analytical chain. In this study, we developed an optimized, efficient protocol with a duration of 72 h for the digestion of laboratory rat feed and feces. A combination of a mild acidic (H2O2 15%; HNO3 5%) and an alkaline treatment (10% KOH) dissolving the previous filter, followed by enzymatic digestion (Viscozyme®L) proved to be efficient for the extraction and identification of spiked polyamide (15–20 μm) and polyethylene (40–48 μm) from feed and feces samples from rats, showing high recovery rates. Extracted rat feces samples from an in vivo study in which Wistar rats were fed with feed containing microplastic were analyzed with pyrolysis-gas chromatography-Orbitrap™ mass spectrometry, quantifying recovered microplastic in rat feces in environmentally relevant concentrations. The presented three-step protocol provides a suitable, time and cost-effective method to extract microplastic from rat feed and feces.
