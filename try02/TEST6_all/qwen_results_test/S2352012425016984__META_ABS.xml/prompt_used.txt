You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on long-term prestress loss of circumferential tendons in external walls of LNG tanks Accurate monitoring of long-term prestress loss in prestressed concrete external tanks for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is an crucial means for assessing their safety during service. However, the applicability of the existing prestress loss calculation formulas in current specifications to cylindrical structures remains questionable, and there is a lack of measured data on the prestress loss of circumferential tendons in large LNG external tanks. In this study, an embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) smart steel strand was employed to conduct a 540-day in situ quasi-distributed monitoring test of horizontal prestress in a membrane LNG experimental external wall, investigating the long-term prestress loss in cylindrical shell prestressed concrete structures (PCSs). The results indicate that after 540 days, the average horizontal prestress loss due to concrete shrinkage and creep was 13 % at the anchorage end, 12.1 % at the midspan, and 11.2 % at the tensioning end. The maximum loss value was 138.3 MPa at the 20B anchorage end, while the minimum loss value was 99.3 MPa at the 26 A tensioning end. Based on the monitoring data and in combination with the method of age-adjusted effective modulus, considering the interaction between prestressing tendons and reinforcement as well as the coupling effect of concrete shrinkage, creep and stress relaxation, a unified calculation formula for prestress loss due to shrinkage and creep in cylindrical shell PCS was proposed based on existing specifications. The average absolute value of the relative error between the calculated and measured values is capped at 4.7 %, which is lower than the average error of over 6.5 % for the existing formulas in specifications, demonstrating higher accuracy. Meanwhile, the smart steel strands used in the monitoring exhibited excellent performance and high accuracy, making them suitable for prestress monitoring in cylindrical structures.
