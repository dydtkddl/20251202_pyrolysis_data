You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomethanol production via electrolysis, oxy-fuel combustion, water-gas shift reaction, and LNG cold energy recovery The hydrogen economy is of crucial importance in energy policies worldwide. Moreover, there are many benefits to producing biomethanol because it can be used in engines to achieve high efficiency, zero emission and lower risks of flammability. This research aims to evaluate a biomethanol and natural gas generation system that uses biomass gasification and high-temperature electrolysis. Thermal integration is applied between the steam generators of the gasifier and electrolyzer. The LNG regasification unit and an open Brayton cycle are responsible for power and natural gas production. The flue gas leaving the gas turbine leads to additional production of biomethanol. Oxygen management is applied between three different subsystems and there is a large amount of CO2 utilization as well. The results of energy analysis and thermodynamic modelling of an integrated system conducted in Aspen Plus indicate that the proposed cycle produces 16 644 ton/yr of natural gas, 1412 ton/yr of biomethanol, uses 3450 ton/yr of CO2, and has an efficiency of 81.96 %. Raising the methanol reactor temperature from 220 °C to 350 °C significantly enhances biomethanol capacity from 1015 ton/yr to 1930 ton/yr, leading to a 4 % increase in total energy efficiency.
