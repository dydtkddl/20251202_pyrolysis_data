You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced nano boron nitride architectures: Synthesis, properties and emerging applications Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an extraordinarily tough material that is chemically and thermally resistant to extreme environments, uniquely electrically insulating yet possessing exceptionally high thermal conductivity. Owing to these exotic and outstanding properties, and the ability to be controllably fabricated at large-scale, various architectures of low-dimensional h-BN have emerged as promising candidates for a myriad of applications. This review provides a comprehensive and holistic account of the most widely utilized fabrication techniques with emphasis on new advancements for various forms of nano-BN architectures ranging from 0D quantum dots, 1D nanotubes and nanoribbons, 2D nanosheets and 3D frameworks of BN. These techniques encompass improved synthesis progresses by chemical vapor deposition, scalable forms of exfoliation, bottom-up and top-down hydrothermal/solvothermal processes and assembly of 3D structures by freeze-casting. Furthermore, the functional properties and utilization of these nano-BN architectures for various novel and evolving applications including thermal management for modern electronics, deep ultraviolet optoelectronics, single photon quantum emitters, protective coatings against corrosion, high-performance polymer dielectrics, space instrumentation, drug delivery, tissue engineering and biosensing are extensively elaborated. Finally, several major challenges and limitations of the existing fabrication technologies that hinder further upscaling and commercialization are highlighted, which offer new opportunities for the development of advanced BN nanostructures toward diverse emerging and future applications.
