You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigations of superparamagnetism in magnesium ferrite nano-sphere synthesized by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique for hyperthermia application In this paper, we present the synthesized of magnesium ferrite (MgFe2O4) nano-spheres by a single-step ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) technique from the aqueous metal nitrate precursor solution without any organic additives or post-annealing processes. The effects of different pyrolysis temperatures on the particles size, morphology and their superparamagnetic behavior have been investigated to evaluate the heat generation efficiency in an AC magnetic field. The X-ray powder diffraction spectra of MgFe2O4 nano-spheres synthesized at the pyrolysis temperatures of 600, 700, 800 and 900°C exhibited single phase cubic structure and obtained mean crystallite size (primary particles) of 4.05, 9.6, 15.97 and 31.48nm, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms that the particles consisted of aggregates of the primary crystallite had densely congested spherical morphology with extremely smooth surface appearance. Field emission electron microscopy (FESEM) reveals that the shape and size of the nano-spheres (secondary particles) does not change significantly but the degree of agglomeration between the secondary particles was reduced with increasing the pyrolysis temperature. The average size and size distribution of nano-spheres measured using electrophoretic scattering photometer have found very low polydispersity index (PDI) for all samples. The field dependent magnetization studies indicated superparamagnetic nature for the particles having crystallite size i.e. 4.05 and 9.6nm and exhibited ferromagnetic nature for 15.97 and 31.48nm. It is also demonstrated that, as the pyrolysis temperature increases, the saturation magnetization of the MgFe2O4 nanopowders increases due to enhancement of crystallites. The shift in Curie temperature is well described by the finite-size scaling formula. The magnetically loss heating values of selected samples in crystallite size of 9.6 and 15.97nm were investigated by measuring the time dependent temperature curves in an external alternating magnetic field (370kHz, 1.77kA/m). The more heat generation ability was obtained for 9.6nm in crystal size because of minimum squareness ratio with coercivity in superparamagnetic range. The results reported in this study are useful to find out of superparamagnetic limit for the preparation of MgFe2O4 nanopowders.
