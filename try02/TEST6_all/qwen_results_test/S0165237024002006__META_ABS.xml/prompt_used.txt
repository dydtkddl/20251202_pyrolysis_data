You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of sludge biochar by steam pyrolysis and acid treatment: Study of the activation mechanism and its impact on physicochemical properties This study addresses the preparation of sludge biochar through a procedure that combines steam pyrolysis in a wide range of temperature (500–900 ºC) and acid treatment with HCl (performed before or after the pyrolysis). The acid washing after the pyrolysis maximizes BET surface area due to pore unblocking, thus making visible the pore structure generated. The drawback of the acid washing is the lower yield obtained (compared to the acid pretreatment), as well as the loss of the magnetic properties of sludge biochar. The acid pretreatment requires temperatures above 700 ºC to have a beneficial effect, due to the occurrence of additional reactions of the incorporated HCl with sludge constituents. The pretreatment results in materials with a high degree of microporosity. Among the reactions favoured, of interest is the development of magnetite in the whole temperature range. The activation protocol used in this study (especially the procedure that includes the acid pretreatment) is effective to generate biochar with magnetic properties through the transformation of the Fe introduced during the water treatment process, without adding a source of Fe. The presence of magnetite is an advantage for the reuse of sludge biochars in wastewater treatment.
