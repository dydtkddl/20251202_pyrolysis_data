You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cracking of plastic pyrolysis oil over FCC equilibrium catalysts to produce fuels: Kinetic modeling The kinetics of the catalytic cracking of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) over three FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) equilibrium commercial catalysts has been modeled. The PPO comes from the fast pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The cracking runs have been carried out in a laboratory-scale reactor under FCC conditions: 500–560 °C; catalyst/oil weight ratio of 5 gcat gPPO -1; and contact time of 1.5–6 s. Four different reaction schemes composed of six lumps have been compared and it has been obtained by statistical means that the simplest one is the most appropriate for describing the process. The differences in the kinetic parameters have been related to the properties of the catalysts. Among them, total acidity and mesoporous structure have a key role. The former for promoting the cracking reactions and the latter for limiting the diffusional restrictions of both the bulky compounds within the PPO and the formed coke precursors. This way, ECAT-3 that is the most acid and most mesoporous catalyst, maximizes the yields of naphtha (33.6 wt%) and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) (18.9 wt%). In contrast, ECAT-1 and ECAT-2 should be chosen for producing light cycle oil (LCO). For ECAT-3, the apparent activation energies of the conversion of heavy cycle oil (HCO) into light cycle oil (LCO), LCO into naphtha, and LCO into LPG are 60.5 42.5 and 58.3 kJ mol-1, respectively. In addition, those of the formation of coke from HCO, LPG and dry gas are 129.0, 4.4 and 40.7 kJ mol-1, respectively.
