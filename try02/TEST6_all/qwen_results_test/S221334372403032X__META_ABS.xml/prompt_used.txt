You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of current technologies for the sustainable valorisation of sugarcane bagasse The Australian sugar industry over the last few years has focused heavily on the valorisation of sugarcane bagasse, an abundant lignocellulosic biomass that has the potential to be converted into many valuable chemicals and materials. Despite this, it is currently an under-utilised material that is often burnt inefficiently as a means of disposal. As such, researchers are greatly committed to finding new methods of converting bagasse into higher-value products. These methods include a variety of thermal and biological processes as well as the conversion of bagasse into other biobased materials. However, due to the vast number of applications of sugarcane bagasse, optimal utilisation in terms of economic and environmental sustainability is a major challenge. Therefore, this article provides an overview on the recent advancements in the valorisation of sugarcane bagasse while comparing the feasibility of each process for the Australian sugar industry. For biological processes, high pretreatment costs and long processing times make them economically unviable, while the production of biobased materials require large volumes of water and produce toxic wastes, making them difficult to integrate into sugar mills. For thermal processes, pyrolysis was determined to be a suitable valorisation method due to its fast-processing times, low water usage and the promising applications available for the resulting biochar and bio-oil, which include their potential as a low-cost sugar colour adsorbent and insecticide respectively.
