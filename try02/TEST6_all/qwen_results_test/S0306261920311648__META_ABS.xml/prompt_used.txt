You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic co-pyrolysıs of polyolefin plastics with wood and agricultural wastes for biofuel production Renewable lignocellulosic biomass is a promising energy resource since its co-pyrolysis with hydrogen-rich plastics can produce high-yield and high-quality bio-oil. In this study, co-pyrolysis of agricultural wastes (i.e. corn stover) and wood wastes (i.e. narra, Pterocarpus indicus and ipil, Intsia bijuga) with polyolefin plastics (i.e. polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene) were examined via thermogravimetric analyses. Unlike previous co-pyrolysis studies which had focused on the improvement of product yield or cumulative weight loss, herein, we present the synergistic effects on the mass decomposition rate or rate of generation of products during co-pyrolysis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of temperature, and biomass-to-plastic ratio on rate synergy during co-pyrolysis. Rate synergy values up to 10% per min were obtained for biomass and plastic blends. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor of the reactions in the co-pyrolysis process were evaluated using the Coats-Redfern method. Activation energies for agricultural waste and plastics blends ranged from 45 to 82 kJ mol−1 while that for wood wastes and plastic blends ranged from 53 to 112 kJ mol−1. Interestingly, the activation energy of the thermal decomposition of plastic was found to be lower during co-pyrolysis with biomass than in pure form. Moreover, biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis followed a two-stage degradation: biomass degradation from 200 to 400 °C and thereafter plastic degradation from 400 to 500 °C. Overall, the use of lignocellulosic biomass and waste plastics for biofuel production can also minimize the volume of solid wastes for landfills.
