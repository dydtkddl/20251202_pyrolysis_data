Practically simple, catalyst-free, and scalable approach for all-component upcycling of mixed PVC/PA plastics The recycling of discarded THHN cables generates a substantial amount of mixed PVC/PA waste plastics, presenting a significant challenge to achieving sustainable development. In this study, we present a simple, catalyst-free, and scalable approach for upcycling all components of mixed PVC/PA waste. This method leverages HCl released from PVC during hydrothermal treatment to catalyse the cleavage of amide bonds in PA, converting mixed PVC/PA waste into valuable platform chemicals (over 80 % product yield) and carbon black within 30 min. Our work demonstrates a high-value recycling process for mixed PVC/PA waste in discarded THHN cables, reducing the generation of harmful Cl-containing waste, mitigating environmental pollution caused by mixed plastics, and offering valuable insights for the recycling of other PVC-containing mixed plastic wastes.
