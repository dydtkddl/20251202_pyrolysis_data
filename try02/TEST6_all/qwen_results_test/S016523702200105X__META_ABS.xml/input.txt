Pyrolysis and thermal degradation studies of silane-carbosilane transformation using hyphenated thermal analysis Pyrolysis process accompanying polydimethylsilane to polycarbosilane transformation and the decomposition behaviors of polydimethylsilane (PDMS), polycarbosilanes (PCS Mk-I/II and III) were investigated applying evolved gas analysis and pyrolysis–gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Volatile fractions evolved during the reactions were recorded as specific pyrograms. The degradation of the polymer skeleton under argon leads to the evolution of methyl silane and higher linear oligomers in the molar mass range 42 ̶ 348 Da; the escape of hydrogen starts simultaneously. Based on the results, specific pyrolysis patterns and decomposition behavior of PDMS, PCS Mk-III were established. Mass spectral data revealed the structural and compositional identification of molecular moieties evolved during the pyrolysis reactions. Thermal data confirmed and complemented the pyrolysis data.
