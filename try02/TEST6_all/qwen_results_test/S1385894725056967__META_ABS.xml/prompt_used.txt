You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Theoretical and kinetic modeling study of H 2 S pyrolysis Hydrogen sulfide pyrolysis was investigated theoretically and through chemical kinetic modeling. Reactions on the SHH potential energy surface, primarily S + H 2 (+Ar) ⇄ H 2 S (+ Ar) (R1) and S + H 2 ⇄ SH + H (R6b) were characterized by ab initio calculations. Results for k 1 were in good agreement with experiment, but deviated strongly below 2000 K from values previously used in modeling. Collider efficiencies for H 2 S, S 2 , and N 2 compared to Ar were calculated for R1. Hydrogen sulfide decomposition experiments reported in literature were re-examined in terms of an updated detailed chemical kinetic model. Concentration profiles for the atomic S at high temperature in shock tubes supported the present value of k 1 and served to constrain the rate constants for reaction of S with SH and H 2 S. To explain results from batch and flow reactors, conducted at high H 2 S concentrations in the 900–1400 K range, a very fast rate constant was required for HSS + H ⇄ SH + SH. Under dilute conditions, the gas-phase chemistry was too slow to compete and the decomposition of H 2 S was controlled by loss on the reactor surface.
