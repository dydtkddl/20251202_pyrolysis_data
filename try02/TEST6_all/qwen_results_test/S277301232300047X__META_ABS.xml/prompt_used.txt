You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chloride-doped ZnO thin films prepared by spray pyrolysis: Effects on microstructural, optical, and photocatalytic properties This study discusses the effects of chloride doping on the photocatalytic properties of ZnO thin films, evaluated under UV-A radiation (365 ± 5 nm) using acetaminophen as a model reactant. Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films doped with chloride anions were prepared by spray pyrolysis. The films were homogeneous, stable to hydrodynamic forces, and photocatalytically active. The doping procedure affected the photoactivity of the semiconductor, its light absorption properties and the morphology of the surface, and promoted a redshift of the absorption edge. The microstructure of the films showed a positive correlation between the concentration and the degree of particle agglomeration; however, the higher content of chloride also promoted higher porosity. The undoped ZnO films exhibited the best photocatalytic performance under the investigated conditions. By comparing this work with the recent literature on the use of ZnO in the photocatalytic oxidation of acetaminophen, it was found that the synthesized ZnO films have better energetic efficiency (EE0,med = 9.91 kWh L−1) and provide similar quantum yields (φmed = 6.84 × 10−4 mol E−1). Finally, a segregation study indicates that grain-boundary segregation has a strong impact on photocatalytic efficiency, offering a sustainable and low cost alternative for designing ZnO-based photocatalysts.
