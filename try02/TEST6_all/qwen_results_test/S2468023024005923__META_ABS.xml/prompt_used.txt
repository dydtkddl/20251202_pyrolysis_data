You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon shell derived from bottle waste PET on α-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterostructure core as synergetic Fenton-like catalyst for degradation of antibiotics In this work, two approaches to environmental sustainability have been followed including the synthesis of an efficient and easily recyclable catalyst for Fenton-like degradation of antibiotics from water, and the upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into the value-added product through a feasible procedure. For this purpose, the Fe2O3/Fe3O4 mixture coated by the carbon layer derived from the bottle waste PET was synthesized for boosting the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle in the Fenton-like reaction. The FeCl3 can act as a catalyst for graphitization process and also the precursor of metal oxide nanoparticles. The catalytic efficiency was evaluated for the degradation reaction of amoxicillin and azithromycin antibiotics. Complete conversion of amoxicillin and azithromycin (15 mg/L) was observed in the presence of 5 µL of H2O2, at pH=3 for 30 min. Also, the mineralization of amoxicillin and azithromycin was evaluated by TOC analysis, which was obtained as 77 and 89 %, respectively. The high activity of the catalyst can be attributed to the presence of a mixture of iron oxide nanoparticles for the catalysis of Fenton-like reactions and activation of H2O2, as well as the coating of nanoparticles with a carbon layer to stabilize and prevent metal leakage and contamination of the mixture. In addition, due to the good electrical conductivity of carbon layer, it can act as electron donors to enhance Fe3+ reduction.
