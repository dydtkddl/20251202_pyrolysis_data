You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The fate of post-use biodegradable PBAT-based mulch films buried in agricultural soil The fate of black biodegradable mulch film (MF) based on starch and poly(butylene-adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) in agricultural soil is investigated herein. Pristine (BIO-0) and UV-aged film samples (BIO-A192) were buried for 16 months at an experimental field in southern Italy. Visual, physical, chemical, morphological, and mechanical analyses were carried out before and after samples burial. Film residues in the form of macro- and microplastics in soil were analyzed at the end of the trial. Progressive deterioration of both pristine and UV-aged samples, with surface loss and alterations in mechanical properties, occurred from 42 days of burial. After 478 days, the apparent surface of BIO-0 and BIO-A192 films decreased by 57 % and 66 %, respectively. Burial determined a rapid depletion of starch from the polymeric blend, especially for the BIO-A192, while the degradation of the polyester phase was slower. Upon burial, an enrichment of aromatic moieties of PBAT in the film residues was observed, as well as microplastics release to soil. The analysis of the MF degradation products extracted from soil (0.006–0.008 % by mass in the soil samples) revealed the predominant presence of adipate moieties. After 478 days of burial, about 23 % and 17 % of the initial amount of BIO-0 and BIO-A192, respectively, were extracted from the soil. This comprehensive study underscores the complexity of biodegradation phenomena that involve the new generation of mulch films in the field. The different biodegradability of the polymeric components, the climate, and the soil conditions that did not strictly meet the parameters required for the standard test method devised for MFs, have significantly influenced their degradation rate. This finding further emphasizes the importance of implementing field experiments to accurately assess the real effects of biodegradable MFs on soil health and overall agroecosystem sustainability.
