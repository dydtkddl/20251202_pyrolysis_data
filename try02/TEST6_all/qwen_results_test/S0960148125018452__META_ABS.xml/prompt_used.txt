You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of La, Ce or Pr modified Dol-C dual-support catalysts on the co-gasification of coal gangue and biomass for the production of hydrogen-rich gas The accumulation of coal gangue (CG) causes serious environmental pollution. Co-gasifying CG with pine sawdust (PS) for H2-rich syngas is a promising solution, where catalysts matter for hydrogen production and gas composition. In this study, La, Ce, or Pr were added to the dual-support catalysts of dolomite (Dol) and biochar (C) to investigate the effects of different rare earth element-loaded dual-support catalysts on the production of H2-rich syngas from the co-gasification of CG and PS. The experimental results show that when using the La/Ce/Pr-Dol-C catalysts with the optimal loading amount, the H2 components in the gas products are greater than 45 mol%. Among them, the syngas produced by the 2 wt% Pr-Dol-C catalyst has the highest H2 component, reaching 52 mol%, and the yield is 11.28 mmol/g blends. In addition, the effects of various operating conditions on the production of H2-rich gas under the 2 wt% Pr-Dol-C catalyst were explored, and the action mechanism of the catalyst during the co-gasification process was analyzed. The results indicate that the La/Ce/Pr-Dol-C dual-support catalysts can significantly promote the co-gasification reaction of CG and PS, and improve the production and purity of H2-rich gas. This study provides new ways for comprehensively utilizing CG and PS.
