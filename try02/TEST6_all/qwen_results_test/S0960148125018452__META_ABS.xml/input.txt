Effect of La, Ce or Pr modified Dol-C dual-support catalysts on the co-gasification of coal gangue and biomass for the production of hydrogen-rich gas The accumulation of coal gangue (CG) causes serious environmental pollution. Co-gasifying CG with pine sawdust (PS) for H2-rich syngas is a promising solution, where catalysts matter for hydrogen production and gas composition. In this study, La, Ce, or Pr were added to the dual-support catalysts of dolomite (Dol) and biochar (C) to investigate the effects of different rare earth element-loaded dual-support catalysts on the production of H2-rich syngas from the co-gasification of CG and PS. The experimental results show that when using the La/Ce/Pr-Dol-C catalysts with the optimal loading amount, the H2 components in the gas products are greater than 45 mol%. Among them, the syngas produced by the 2 wt% Pr-Dol-C catalyst has the highest H2 component, reaching 52 mol%, and the yield is 11.28 mmol/g blends. In addition, the effects of various operating conditions on the production of H2-rich gas under the 2 wt% Pr-Dol-C catalyst were explored, and the action mechanism of the catalyst during the co-gasification process was analyzed. The results indicate that the La/Ce/Pr-Dol-C dual-support catalysts can significantly promote the co-gasification reaction of CG and PS, and improve the production and purity of H2-rich gas. This study provides new ways for comprehensively utilizing CG and PS.
