You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2 char gasification: A systematic review from 2014 to 2020 Global efforts to mitigate climate change are based on forecasts of future warmer temperatures on the earth’s surface. Climate warming is caused by the positive radiative imbalances triggered by the accumulated Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. The energy sector accounts for more than 75% of the CO2 emissions. Recycling CO2 to useful molecules is the most desirable path. However, the high thermodynamic stability of CO2 makes this path expensive. The forward Boudouard reaction also called char gasification (C + CO 2 → 2CO) represents a possible method of recycling CO2. This reaction is highly endothermic at relatively low temperatures. The char for the reaction is necessary and available from pyrolysis of carbonaceous materials. Pyrolysis of typical carbonaceous material consist of initial fast devolatilization followed by relatively slow char gasification. Therefore, char gasification with CO2 reduction is the rate limiting step. This review is focused on the recent (2014–2020) literature involving acceleration of this important step. Pretreatment of char including the use of microwave heating may be a useful technique. The use, recovery and reuse of catalysts to enhance the rates of the forward Boudouard reaction at manageable temperatures is discussed. In situ imaging and management of the evolution of the char microstructure as a means of maintaining and enhancing the gasification rates has significant potential.
