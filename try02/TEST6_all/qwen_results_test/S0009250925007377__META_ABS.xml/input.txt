Two birds with one stone: Green preparation of carbon fibers and porous carbon nanosheets from polypropylene Polyolefin-based carbon fibers are considered highly promising in the low-cost carbon fiber family due to their high tensile strength. However, strong acid sulfonation is considered to be a limiting factor in improving the mechanical properties of polyolefin-based carbon fibers. Moreover, the waste acid produced by sulfonation has a negative impact on the environment. In this study, polypropylene (PP) fibers were stabilized by sulfonation using a mild sulfuric acid/acetyl sulfate combination, and the carbonization yield of PP-based carbon fibers was as high as 58.9 %. The tensile strength of PP-based carbon fibers was increased from 390 MPa to 1010 MPa. In addition, high-value separation and recycling of sulfonation waste acid from stabilization process were carried out. Porous carbon nanosheets (CNS) with promising applications in energy storage were prepared using recycled waste solids. This work is an important step in promoting the green and low-carbon development of low-cost PP-based carbon fibers.
