You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Achieving affordable and clean energy through conversion of waste plastic to liquid fuel Millions of tons of waste plastic are generated worldwide every year. These waste plastics are nonbiodegradable and are inappropriately disposed thereby constituting sanitary and environmental nuisance to society. The discarded plastics are dumped into drainages and water bodies where they pollute the environment, contaminate aquatic habitats, and harm aquatic animals. Researchers have devised techniques for converting waste plastic to biofuels to replace the dangerous fossil-based fuels and meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of affordable and clean energy for all targets. This study reviews the strategies for achieving affordable and clean energy through the conversion of waste plastic to biofuels and other value-added products. The classes of plastics and their applications, waste plastic conversion routes and their products, and conversion of waste plastic to bio-oil, biohydrogen, and other renewable fuels are examined. The application of waste plastic in the building and construction industries, production of carbon nanotubes, synthesis of graphene nanosheets as novel biocatalyst, and wastewater treatment are also discussed with a view to exposing other avenues for the utilization of waste plastic. The outcome of this intervention will enrich scholarship by providing updated information on the strategies for converting waste plastic to biofuels and other value-added products. Biofuel researchers, waste managers, environmental enthusiasts, and other stakeholders will be equipped with adequate knowledge on opportunities available in the waste plastic conversion and how to turn the menace of waste plastic into beneficial products. Implementable legislations and policies to encourage investments into waste conversion for cleaner environment, employment generation, and biodiversity. More targeted interdisciplinary studies are required to evolve innovative pathways for sustainable conversion and utilization of waste plastic. The use of appropriate state-of-the-art technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. as well as statistical modeling, and optimization tools are needed to improve the conversion efficiency, optimize process parameters, and guarantee the sustainable production of quality products from waste plastic towards meeting SDG 7.
