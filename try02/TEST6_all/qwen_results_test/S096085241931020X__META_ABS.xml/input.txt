A review on biopolymer production via lignin valorization Lignin based biopolymer (value added products) production is the most promising technology in the perspective of lignin valorization and sustainable development. Valorization of lignin gain the potentials to produce biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, polyhydroxybutyrates, polyurethane etc. However, lignin valorization processes still needs development due to the recalcitrant nature of lignin which restricts its potential to produce valuable products. Many novel extraction strategies have been developed to fragment the lignin structure and make ease the recovery of valuable products. Achieving in depth insights on lignin characteristics and structure will help to understand the metabolic and catalytic degradative pathways needed for lignin valorization. In the view of multipurpose characteristics of lignin for biopolymer production, this review will spot light the potential applications of lignin and lignin based derivatives on biopolymer production, various lignin separation technologies, lignin depolymerization process, biopolymers production strategies and the challenges in lignin valorization will be addressed and discussed.
