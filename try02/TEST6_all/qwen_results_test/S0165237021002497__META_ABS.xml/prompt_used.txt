You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production and use of biochar from lignin and lignin-rich residues (such as digestate and olive stones) for wastewater treatment Clean water is an essential resource for life, and its demand is continuously increasing with the rapid growth in population, while the freshwater reserves are also depleting. A large amount of wastewater is released by different industries, which is affecting the environment as well as polluting the freshwater reserves. Recycling and treatment of wastewater are highly essential to meet the demand for clean water and to protect the environment. Activated carbon can be used in primary, secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment steps. It can be used to capture pollutants which stop microbial activity or to produce clean water with high purity. About 3 million tons of activated carbon are produced per year and it is mainly used for fluid purification. The objective of this review is to investigate the preparation and production of biochar from lignin which is an important resource available in great quantities (about 100 Million tons per year) and the practical application of it for wastewater treatment. Biochar can be produced through pyrolysis (at temperatures of 600-700 °C) and hydrothermal carbonization (at temperature between 180-300 °C). Subsequent activation can be performed in two ways (physical and chemical), usually at temperatures between 600-800 °C. The quality of biochar and activated carbon produced from lignin-rich residue can be very high, even though the costs also are higher respect to other fossil derived materials (carbon black, lignite and pet coke).
