Recent advances in lignocellulosic biomass-derived biochar-based photocatalyst for wastewater remediation Background The disposal of wastewater into ecosystems poses significant risks to both aquatic and human life, necessitating the removal of contaminants. Biochar produced through the thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass, offers a sustainable solution. Methods Various advanced technologies have been combined with biochar to enhance wastewater treatment, with photocatalytic degradation emerging as an effective method. Biochar-based photocatalysts have shown significant potential in degrading a wide range of organic pollutants. This review covers recent advancements in using biochar to eliminate organic pollutants in water, focusing on antibiotics, dyes, and heavy metals. Additionally, it discusses the physicochemical properties of biochar derived from lignocellulosic biomass, methods for modifying or activating biochar, and the environmental implications, sustainability, and economic prospects of biochar use. Significant findings The high surface area, porosity, and abundant oxygen functional groups of biochar are beneficial in the adsorption and degradation of pollutants. Biochar can function as both an electron storage and electron acceptor, which enhances its versatility and effectiveness in environmental remediation. The effective utilization and suppression of electron-hole pairs in biochar further contribute to its high photocatalytic activity. Biochar has significant environmental and economic benefits. It mitigates climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
