You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in lignocellulosic biomass-derived biochar-based photocatalyst for wastewater remediation Background The disposal of wastewater into ecosystems poses significant risks to both aquatic and human life, necessitating the removal of contaminants. Biochar produced through the thermal decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass, offers a sustainable solution. Methods Various advanced technologies have been combined with biochar to enhance wastewater treatment, with photocatalytic degradation emerging as an effective method. Biochar-based photocatalysts have shown significant potential in degrading a wide range of organic pollutants. This review covers recent advancements in using biochar to eliminate organic pollutants in water, focusing on antibiotics, dyes, and heavy metals. Additionally, it discusses the physicochemical properties of biochar derived from lignocellulosic biomass, methods for modifying or activating biochar, and the environmental implications, sustainability, and economic prospects of biochar use. Significant findings The high surface area, porosity, and abundant oxygen functional groups of biochar are beneficial in the adsorption and degradation of pollutants. Biochar can function as both an electron storage and electron acceptor, which enhances its versatility and effectiveness in environmental remediation. The effective utilization and suppression of electron-hole pairs in biochar further contribute to its high photocatalytic activity. Biochar has significant environmental and economic benefits. It mitigates climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
