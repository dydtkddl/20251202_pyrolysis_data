You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of refuse derived fuels with biomass-based and mineral catalysts Catalytic pyrolysis offers prospects for converting plastic waste into sustainable fuels and chemicals. The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of various catalysts on product yield and to characterize the products for various applications. The study investigated catalytic pyrolysis of RDF using eight (8) different catalysts, including agricultural residue chars and mineral clays at 400°C with a fixed residence time of 60 min and a 1:5 catalyst to feedstock ratio using a batch reactor. Bamboo leaves char produced the highest bio-oil yield of 38.47 wt % and showed the best catalyst effectiveness of 24.06 % for oil production. Rice husk char demonstrated superior performance in char production (66.67 wt %) with the highest effectiveness (133.33 %), while cocopeat char excelled in gas production (50 % effectiveness). The analysis of products revealed that mineral catalysts (kaolin and laterite) generally produced better quality bio-oil with lower viscosity (16–20 cP) and higher heating values (32–34 MJ/kg). FTIR analysis showed mineral catalysts achieved better deoxygenation compared to biomass chars. In gas composition, kaolin produced the highest quality gas (85 % CH4, 33 MJ/Nm³ calorific value), while the char analysis showed cocopeat char had the highest heating value (9.78 MJ/kg). The results demonstrate that catalyst selection significantly impacts product yield and quality, with different catalysts excelling in specific applications.
