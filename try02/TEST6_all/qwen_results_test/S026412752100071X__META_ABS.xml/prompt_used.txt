You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on porous carbon materials engineered by ZnO templates: Design, synthesis and capacitance performance Supercapacitors (SCs), with favorable features including excellent stability, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh power densities, offer a cost-effective avenue for energy storage. Electrode materials play a decisive role in SCs. Porous carbon materials have attracted intense interests benefit from their large specific surface area, tunable porosity and high electrical conductivity. For the preparation of porous carbon materials, various hard templates and soft templates have been explored. Among those templates, nano-ZnO turn out to be good choices owing to their facile preparation, adjustable structures, inexpensive and eco-friendliness. Moreover, ZnO could be converted to Zn via carbothermal reduction and the reduced Zn could catalyze the graphitization of carbon. The resulting Zn will be evaporated which makes the template removing process unnecessary. The major purpose of this review is to elucidate the structure-directing role of ZnO templates for the construction of porous carbon nanomaterials and the capacitance performance of corresponding carbon materials. For this objective, the advance in capacitance performance of porous carbon materials synthesized by ZnO templates in the past few years are summarized. This review provides constructive ideas to the design of porous carbon with ZnO templates and applicable to other hard templates for energy storage applications.
