You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted fluidized bed reactor pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic for pyrolysis gas production towards a sustainable development Conversion of plastic wastes into value added fuels is a good way for sustainable development. In this study, microwave-assisted fluidized bed reactor pyrolysis of polypropylene plastic for pyrolysis gas production was experimentally investigated, and the effects of pyrolysis temperature (700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100 °C), fluidizing velocity (1.18, 2.36, 3.54, 4.72 and 5.90 × 10-3 m/s) and microwave power (600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 W) on the pyrolysis gas products were analyzed. The results showed that when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 700 °C to 900 °C, the pyrolysis gas yield was increased from 65.2 wt% to 76.1 wt%, and then decreased to 60.7 wt% at 1100 °C. The pyrolysis gas yield was increased from 60.2 wt% to 76.1 wt% and then decreased to 42.0 wt% as the fluidizing velocity increased from 1.18 × 10-3 m/s to 5.90 × 10-3 m/s. The pyrolysis gas yield was increased from 52.2 wt% to 76.1 wt% and then decreased to 68.9 wt% as the microwave power increased from 600 W to 1000 W. An optimal pyrolysis gas yield of 76.1 wt% was obtained when the pyrolysis temperature was 900 °C, fluidizing velocity was 2.36 × 10-3 m/s and microwave power was 800 W, and the pyrolysis gas was rich in C3H6 (68.6 wt%), CH4 (15.5 wt%), and C3H8 (7.1 wt%) with a higher heating value of 51.8 MJ/m3. The pyrolysis gas produced with high heating value and abundant propylene has great potentials in applications, i.e., fuel cells.
