You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gas-to-ash detoxification feasibility and pathways by co-combustion of spent pot lining and food waste shells Seeking substitutions for Ca-bearing reagents, this study explored the synergistic co-disposal and co-circularity of spent pot lining (SPL) and food waste shells (oyster, clam, and egg shells) in an eco-friendly way. This study is first to evaluate the feasibility of their co-combustions with or without their mechanochemical activation (MCA) toward the gas-to-ash detoxification of fluorine (F). 50% calcined oyster shell fixed about 97.87% of the F content of SPL in the blend ash and outperformed 50% CaO. MCA weakened the diffraction peaks of graphite carbon by favoring the fixation performance through which collisions between particles and the mixing uniformity were promoted. The combination of 10% SiO2 and 40% calcined clam or egg shells raised the F fixation rate to 98.72 and 99.23%, respectively. F was converted to the complex F–Si–Ca compounds rather than to CaF2. Ca and Si compounds facilitated stabilizing F and Na synchronously and formed NaCa2SiO4F. The leaching F concentration of the ash was less than 100 mg/L, meeting the Chinese criterion (GB 5085.3–2007). The recycling of the food waste shells performed effectively in the cleaner disposal process of SPL by suppressing fluorine emissions.
