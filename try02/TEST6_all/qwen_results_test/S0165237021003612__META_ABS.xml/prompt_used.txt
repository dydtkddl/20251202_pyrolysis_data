You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrating molten carbonates pyrolysis and catalytic reforming with modified HZSM-5 for monophenols produced from digestate Digestate (DE), the residue following anaerobic digestion, has been well utilized as a potential feedstock of molten carbonates pyrolysis and catalytic reforming. The lignin of DE was converted into phenolics, guaiacols and furfural with molten carbonates pyrolysis, and further upgraded to bio-based monophenols by coupling with modified HZSM-5 catalyst. The maximum monophenols yield could achieve 7.22 g/100 g of digestate, and 81.34% of the organic phase of bio-oil at the optimum reaction conditions. The alkali-treated and Fe-loaded on HZSM-5 catalyst, with enhanced pore diameter distinctly and mild acidity, has an outstanding selectivity for monophenols and preferable anti-coking ability in integrated pyrolysis system, while with quite a low catalyst coke yield of 3.97%. The results indicated that the formation of mesopores might minimize the diffusion hindrance of the reactant molecules and reduce coke accumulation. In addition, according to the experiment conducted on a self-designed thermogravimetric analysis device, the kinetic study of the digestate with molten carbonates certificated that the reaction rate of pyrolysis had been promoted by both decreasing activation energy and intensification of heat transfer.
