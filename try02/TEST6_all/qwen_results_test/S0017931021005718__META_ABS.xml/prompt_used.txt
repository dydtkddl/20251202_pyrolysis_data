You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modelling pyrolysis process for PP and HDPE inside thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with differential scanning calorimeter Plastic pyrolysis is widely studied and implemented at lab-scale but rarely modelled numerically. For the sake of designing efficient industrial reactors, modelling plastic pyrolysis process at particle scale could be a prerequisite. Therefore, the aim of this work is to model the whole plastic pyrolysis process, on particle scale, for polypropylene (PP) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) inside a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with differential scanning calorimeter (TGA-DSC). First, the kinetic triplet for PP and HDPE pyrolysis, at heating rates 4-10°C/min, are determined according to the isoconversional methods. Secondly, the kinetic triplets are used along with the appropriate conditions to model and simulate the pyrolysis process for PP and HDPE in TG analyzer, using finite element method. The melting sub-process is modelled using the modified apparent heat capacity method, which resulted in a relative error below 10% between the simulated and measured heat flow. Furthermore, the cracking model describes perfectly PP and HDPE cracking, where the average relative error among all calculated and experimental conversions didn't exceed 5%. Furthermore, the heat flow inside the TGA-DSC crucible was modelled and the average error was reduced to less than 8% by dividing the cracking phenomena into a “latent” and an apparent process.
