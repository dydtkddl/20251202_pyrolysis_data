You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of microfluidic devices by 3D printing: technology, materials, applications and prospects Microfluidic devices have emerged as a cornerstone of chemical process intensification, owing to their exceptional mass and heat transfer efficiencies, precise fluid manipulation, and inherent safety. However, their traditional manufacturing technology is limited by high cost, long cycle and insufficient structural design freedom. Leveraging layer-by-layer additive manufacturing, 3D printing offers a revolutionary approach to fabricating microfluidic devices, characterized by sub-micron resolution, unparalleled design flexibility, and rapid prototyping capabilities. This paper systematically reviews the technical system of 3D printing microfluidic devices for the chemical industry. Starting from the forming mechanism and applicable scenarios of mainstream printing technologies (photocuring, melt extrusion, powder bed melting), the interface characteristics and chemical compatibility of photosensitive resin, thermoplastic wire, metal/ceramic powder and other materials are compared and analyzed. The innovative applications of 3D printed microreactors in chemical scenarios such as catalytic reaction, nanomaterial synthesis, continuous flow separation and multi-functional integration are mainly discussed. Finally, aiming at the key technical bottlenecks such as multi-material co-printing, surface roughness control and high-throughput production, the development direction of high-throughput design-manufacturing-testing platform driven by digital twin is proposed, which provides theoretical support for the industrial application of microfluidic devices and the low-carbon transformation of the chemical industry.
