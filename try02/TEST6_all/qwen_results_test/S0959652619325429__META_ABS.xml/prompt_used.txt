You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cleaner conversion of bamboo into carbon fibre with favourable physicochemical and capacitive properties via microwave pyrolysis combining with solvent extraction and chemical impregnation Bamboo was converted into carbon fibre using a novel approach combining microwave pyrolysis, solvent extraction, and chemical impregnation. The employment of solvent extraction and chemical impregnation transformed natural bamboo into bamboo fibre with yield of 64 wt% that comprised of 87 wt% cellulose, 4 wt% lignin and 9 wt% hemicellulose deemed desirable for conversion into carbon fibre. The subsequent use of microwave pyrolysis transformed the bamboo fibre to form carbon fibre; the effects of microwave irradiation time and microwave power (two key process parameters) on properties of carbon fibre were investigated. Microwave pyrolysis provides a rapid heating rate (30 °C/min) with relatively shorter process time (20 min) compared to that performed by conventional pyrolysis method, thus leading to a relatively lower electric consumption and providing a potentially cost-saving and energy-efficient approach to produce carbon fibre. The production and properties of carbon fibre produced were affected by irradiation time and microwave power. The carbon fibre obtained was detected to have high fixed carbon (80 wt%), carbon element (87%), high BET surface area (475 m2/g) and fibres in small diameter (≤1 μm). It also shows desirable features comprising low content of moisture (<6 wt%), inorganic elements of Na, K, S, Mg (≤5%) and ash (1 wt%), allowing the carbon fibre to have more active sites and making it a cleaner product rather than polluting the environment whereas a high ash content could lead to undesired catalytic reactions and emission of potentially hazardous metallic components present in the ash. Combined with the detection of positive capacitive behaviour, the carbon fibre shows great potential to be used as an electrode for energy storage application. The results disclose that microwave pyrolysis combining with solvent extraction and chemical impregnation can be a cleaner approach to transform bamboo into carbon fibre with favourable physicochemical and capacitive properties.
