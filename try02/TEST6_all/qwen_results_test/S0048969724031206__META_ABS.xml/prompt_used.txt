You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar with enhanced performance prepared based on “graphite-structure regulation” conjecture designed to effectively control water pollution In this work, corn straw was used as raw material, Hummers method and activation were used to adjust the graphite structure in biochar, and preparing straw based biochar (H-BCS) with ultra-high specific surface area (3441.80 m2/g), highly total pore volume (1.9859 cm3/g), and further enhanced physicochemical properties. Compared with untreated straw biochar (BCS), the specific surface area and total pore volume of H-BCS were increased by 47.24 % and 55.85 %, respectively. H-BCS showed good removal ability in subsequent experiments by using chloramphenicol (CP), hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), and crystal violet (CV) as adsorption models. In addition, the adsorption capacities of H-BCS (CP: 1396.30 mg/g, Cr6+: 218.40 mg/g, and CV: 1246.24 mg/g) are not only higher than most adsorbents, even after undergoing 5 cycles of regeneration, its adsorption capacity remains above 80 %, indicating significant potential for practical applications. In addition, we also speculated and analyzed the conjecture about the “graphite-structure regulation” during the preparation process, and finally discussed the possible mechanism during the adsorption processes. We hope this work could provide a new strategy to solve the restriction of biochar performance by further exploring the regulation of graphite structure in carbon materials.
