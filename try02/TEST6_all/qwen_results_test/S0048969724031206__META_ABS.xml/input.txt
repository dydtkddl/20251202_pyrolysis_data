Biochar with enhanced performance prepared based on “graphite-structure regulation” conjecture designed to effectively control water pollution In this work, corn straw was used as raw material, Hummers method and activation were used to adjust the graphite structure in biochar, and preparing straw based biochar (H-BCS) with ultra-high specific surface area (3441.80 m2/g), highly total pore volume (1.9859 cm3/g), and further enhanced physicochemical properties. Compared with untreated straw biochar (BCS), the specific surface area and total pore volume of H-BCS were increased by 47.24 % and 55.85 %, respectively. H-BCS showed good removal ability in subsequent experiments by using chloramphenicol (CP), hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), and crystal violet (CV) as adsorption models. In addition, the adsorption capacities of H-BCS (CP: 1396.30 mg/g, Cr6+: 218.40 mg/g, and CV: 1246.24 mg/g) are not only higher than most adsorbents, even after undergoing 5 cycles of regeneration, its adsorption capacity remains above 80 %, indicating significant potential for practical applications. In addition, we also speculated and analyzed the conjecture about the “graphite-structure regulation” during the preparation process, and finally discussed the possible mechanism during the adsorption processes. We hope this work could provide a new strategy to solve the restriction of biochar performance by further exploring the regulation of graphite structure in carbon materials.
