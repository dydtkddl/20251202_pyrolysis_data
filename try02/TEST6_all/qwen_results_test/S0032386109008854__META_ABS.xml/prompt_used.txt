You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of radical grafting of tetramethylpentadecane and polypropylene on carbon nanotubes' dispersibility in various solvents and polypropylene matrix Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been functionalized by tetramethylpentadecane (TMP), 1-dodecanethiol (DT) and polypropylene (PP) through radical addition onto MWCNTs' surface using dicumyl peroxide as hydrogen abstractor. Surface functionalized MWCNTs were characterized by Raman, IR spectroscopy, elementary analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We studied the effect of temperature, peroxide concentration and solvent on TMP grafting densities and it was found that this surface treatment lead to a fair solubility in various solvents. TMP-functionalized MWCNTs were also imaged by transmission electronic microscopy showing single long functionalized MWCNTs distinct from the starting pristine bundles. For the first time, PP was then grafted onto MWCNTs through a radical grafting reaction. However, scanning electronic microscopy images of PP-functionalized MWCNTs/PP composites did not show a significant improvement in MWCNTs dispersion within the PP matrix.
