You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emerging trends in metal-organic framework (MOFs) photocatalysts for hydrogen energy using water splitting: A state-of-the-art review Various photocatalysts have been developed for photocatalytic water splitting—one of the most important processes that produces dihydrogen as clean energy for fuel cells. The successful achievements for this application are based mainly on transition metal oxides and some metal sulfides/nitrides. Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of hybrid functional materials comprising organic backbone tethered infinitively in limitless way by metal-oxide clusters, both of which can be customized accurately at the molecular level for targeted applications, have been able to photocatalytically degrade water. Apart from representing an array of intrinsic structural and physicochemical characteristics, MOFs are well susceptible for various post-synthetic modifications to address specific challenges. Despite years of research in this field and a good number of seminal studies, further efforts should be geared toward the improvement of light absorption and stability of MOFs, which are the principal challenges that should be overcome. This review includes the most recent research that has been committed to MOFs materials for photocatalytic water-splitting applications. It also encompasses a variety of synthetic techniques and post-modifications that have been employed to increase the performance of MOFs. In addition, a brief discussion of the techno-feasibility analysis of water splitting has been offered, extending the conversation to include current challenges and future direction recommendations. The recent advancements of using MOF photocatalysts for water splitting are further described in a way that benchmark achievements and limitations are considered so that the readers can imagine the big picture in this field and pay considerable attention to future solutions.
