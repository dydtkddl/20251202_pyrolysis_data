Utilization of the residual glycerol from biodiesel production for renewable energy generation A rapid growth in biodiesel production has naturally led to a surplus of crude glycerol generated. Due to the impurities present in the crude glycerol, expensive refining processes are often necessary in order for the crude glycerol to be used in the same applications as pure glycerol. As a result, the demand for crude glycerol is quite low, and biodiesel producers must find ways to dispose it. Disposal can be costly, detrimental to the environment, and wasteful. Exploration of crude glycerol utilization is of significance for not only reducing the negative impact on the environment but also for increasing the economic benefits of biodiesel production. This paper reviewed a number of valuable and practical applications of crude glycerol in the sector of renewable energy generation through processes such as fermentation, digestion, gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, combustion, and steam reforming. Studies indicated that an integration of crude glycerol to other systems for energy production is a promising option despite the impurities in crude glycerol, and some processes even benefit from their presence.
