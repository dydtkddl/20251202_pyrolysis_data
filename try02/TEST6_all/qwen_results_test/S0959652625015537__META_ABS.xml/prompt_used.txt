You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of alginate, fucoidan, phenolics, carotenoids, and hydrochar from beach-cast Ascophyllum nodosum using subcritical water extraction Beach-cast brown seaweeds are an underutilized biomass with high potential for sustainable valorization within a circular economy framework. This study focuses on subcritical water (SCW) as a green, chemical-free solvent to recover high-value bioactive compounds (crude alginate, crude fucoidan, phenolics, carotenoids) and hydrochar from beach-cast Ascophyllum nodosum. Despite increasing interest in seaweed valorization, limited research has optimized SCW processing for beach-cast seaweeds, and the effects of non-isothermal heating time (critical factor for scale-up) remain largely unexplored. To address this, factor screening followed by a central composite design was used to evaluate the effects of final temperature, heating time, hold time, water-to-biomass ratio, pH, and agitation speed on yields and antioxidant activities. Final temperature and hold time significantly affected all responses. Maximum crude alginate (15.80 dry wt%) and crude fucoidan (38.48 dry wt%) yields were obtained at 120 °C, 20 min and 138 °C, 12 min hold times, respectively. Comparable yields were also achieved under non-isothermal heating conditions (no hold time) at 140 °C (crude alginate) and 160 °C (crude fucoidan). At 160 °C and 20 min hold time (total time of 76 min), the crude extract was richest in phenolics and carotenoids and concomitant antioxidant activities. Hydrochar was also recovered 31.23–61.59 dry wt% over 112–168 °C and 0–24 min hold time (total 38–76 min). This work provides not only a framework to develop SCW processes for other types of seaweeds but also demonstrates the value in beach-cast seaweeds compared to their cultivated counterparts.
