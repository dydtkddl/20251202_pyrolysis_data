You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics and kinetic analysis of coating pitch derived from ethylene tar using model-free and model-fitting methods This work conducted the pyrolysis of coating pitch derived from the ethylene tar through thermogravimetry analysis. The thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed to correlate the structural characteristics with the pyrolysis behavior. Meanwhile, the pyrolysis kinetics were estimated with model-free and model-fitting methods. The TG-DTG results showed that the pyrolysis process was generally divided into drying, fast pyrolysis, and polycondensation stages, accompanied by the decomposition of active functional groups like the aliphatic carbons bonded to oxygen ( f al O ), the pyrolysis of relatively stable groups like the non-protonated aromatic carbon ( f a H ), and the condensation of high bonding-energy aromatic structure like aromatic bridgehead carbon ( f a B ). The activation energy obtained from model-free analysis ranged from 78.12 to 150.92 kJ/mol with the increasing conversion, indicating the pyrolysis process as a multi-step reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the reaction model A1/3 ( g α = [ − ln ( 1 − α ) ] 3 ) was identified as the most suitable model for the pyrolysis of coating pitch in the conversion range of 0.25–0.8. The modeling values matched well with the experimental data, indicating the accuracy and feasibility of the results.
