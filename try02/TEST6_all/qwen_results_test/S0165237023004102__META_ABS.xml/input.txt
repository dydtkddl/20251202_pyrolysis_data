Experimental study of microwave processing of pine nut shells into a high-calorie gas: Main results and physicochemical features Involving biomass in the energy sector is a way to replace fossil fuels with renewable and CO2-neutral raw materials, reducing the negative impact on the environment. The energy application of agro-industrial waste is of particular interest, allowing one not only to obtain biofuel, but also to utilize by-products. The present work considers pine nut shells from a candy factory in relation to microwave processing into solid and gaseous fuels. The aim is to study the features of pine nut shells microwave pyrolysis, including the initiation mechanism and process behaviour, as well as the composition and characteristics of the resulting products. The study included experimentation in combination with application of high-speed video recording of the process and gas analysis, study of dielectric characteristics of raw materials, proximate and ultimate analysis of the obtained solid and gaseous products. At microwave pyrolysis, the conversion degree into liquid and gaseous products (76.9%) is much higher than, for example, at slow fixed bed pyrolysis (65.5%). The radiation absorption by the sample is nonlinear throughout the process and increases during the organic part degradation with the appearance of liquid and gaseous products. The gas obtained at microwave processing has a low ballast (share of CO2 =3.5%) and a high hydrogen content (share of H2 =19.3%) that results in a high heat of combustion (21.8 MJ·m−3), which is probably connected with interaction of pyrogenetic water and fuel carbon during plasma-chemical reactions.
