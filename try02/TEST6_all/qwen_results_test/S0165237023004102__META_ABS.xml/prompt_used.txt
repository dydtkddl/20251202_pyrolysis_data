You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study of microwave processing of pine nut shells into a high-calorie gas: Main results and physicochemical features Involving biomass in the energy sector is a way to replace fossil fuels with renewable and CO2-neutral raw materials, reducing the negative impact on the environment. The energy application of agro-industrial waste is of particular interest, allowing one not only to obtain biofuel, but also to utilize by-products. The present work considers pine nut shells from a candy factory in relation to microwave processing into solid and gaseous fuels. The aim is to study the features of pine nut shells microwave pyrolysis, including the initiation mechanism and process behaviour, as well as the composition and characteristics of the resulting products. The study included experimentation in combination with application of high-speed video recording of the process and gas analysis, study of dielectric characteristics of raw materials, proximate and ultimate analysis of the obtained solid and gaseous products. At microwave pyrolysis, the conversion degree into liquid and gaseous products (76.9%) is much higher than, for example, at slow fixed bed pyrolysis (65.5%). The radiation absorption by the sample is nonlinear throughout the process and increases during the organic part degradation with the appearance of liquid and gaseous products. The gas obtained at microwave processing has a low ballast (share of CO2 =3.5%) and a high hydrogen content (share of H2 =19.3%) that results in a high heat of combustion (21.8 MJ·m−3), which is probably connected with interaction of pyrogenetic water and fuel carbon during plasma-chemical reactions.
