You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Algae-driven bioelectrochemical systems: Recent advances, applications, and prospects Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are sustainable biotechnologies that have garnered global interest in recent decades. Since their inception, these systems have evolved through various configurations and modifications to enhance performance, prominently featuring microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Researchers are addressing the scaling challenges of MFCs with studies on algae-assisted MFCs (algae-MFCs), which simultaneously generate bioelectricity and treat wastewater cost-effectively. Algae-MFCs are carbon-neutral and photosynthesize to sequester CO2 while producing oxygen (O2) and biomass. O2 serves as an effective electron acceptor, and biomass is a biofuel feedstock, making the process economical and eco-friendly. This review highlights recent advances in algae-based MFCs, focusing on bioelectricity generation (up to 26,680 mW/m2) and biofuel outputs (200 mL/L/h of biohydrogen, 286 mL/g/VS of biomethane, 3.37 g/L of biobutanol, 73 g/L of bioethanol, and 121,104 kg/ha∙year of biodiesel), along with innovations in biokerosene (bio-jet) technology. The impacts of reactor components and configurations on algae-MFC performance, scaling strategies, real-time applications, and computational studies of algae-based BESs are also examined. Furthermore, this review assesses the technoeconomic viability, challenges, and future prospects of this technology. Overall, the findings suggest that algae-MFCs effectively remove contaminants from wastewater and increase power generation while also outlining directions for future advancements.
