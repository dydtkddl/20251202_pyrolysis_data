You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste plastics recycling for producing high-value carbon nanotubes: Investigation of the influence of Manganese content in Fe-based catalysts Thermo-chemical conversion is a promising technology for the recycle of waste plastics, as it can produce high-value products such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hydrogen. However, the low yield of CNTs is one of the challenges. In this work, the addition of Mn (0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 5 wt.%, and 10 wt.%) to Fe-based catalyst to improve the production of CNTs has been investigated. Results show that the increase of Mn content from 0 wt.% to 10 wt.% significantly promotes CNTs yield formed on the catalyst from 23.4 wt.% to 32.9 wt.%. The results show that Fe-particles in the fresh catalysts are between 10−25 nm. And the addition of Mn in the Fe-based catalyst enhanced the metal-support interactions and the dispersion of metal particles, thus leading to the improved catalytic performance in relation to filamentous carbon growth. In addition, the graphitization of CNTs is promoted with the increase of Mn content. Overall, in terms of the quantity and quality of the produced CNTs, 5 wt.% of Mn in Fe-based catalyst shows the best catalytic performance, due to the further increase of Mn content from 5 wt.% to 10 wt.% led to a dramatic decrease of purity by 10 wt.%.
