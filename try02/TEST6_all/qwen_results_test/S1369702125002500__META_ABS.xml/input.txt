Revolutionizing fiber materials for space: Multi-scale interface engineering unlocks new aerospace frontiers Space exploration represents a critical frontier for advancing human knowledge and technology. However, the extreme space environment—characterized by wide temperature fluctuations, vacuum, radiation, atomic oxygen erosion, and micrometeoroid impacts—places exceptional demands on spacecraft materials. These conditions necessitate materials that are lightweight, thermally stable, radiation- and corrosion-resistant, and mechanically robust. High-performance fibers and fiber-reinforced composites have emerged as key candidates due to their excellent specific strength, stiffness, and tunable functionalities, finding broad use in spacecraft components, astronaut gear, and shielding systems. Despite growing interest in space-applied fiber materials, comprehensive reviews integrating material design principles, interface engineering strategies, and practical aerospace applications remain scarce. This review addresses that gap by systematically analyzing recent advances in high-performance fibers and composites for space use. It focuses on their performance under multifactorial space conditions and the impact of interfacial modification and matrix architectures on composite mechanics. Functional applications—such as atomic oxygen resistance, thermal protection systems, and electromagnetic shielding—are critically discussed, with an emphasis on limitations and challenges. Finally, we highlight future directions for material innovation, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to advance next-generation aerospace fiber systems that not only meet demanding mission requirements but also support long-term sustainability for deep-space exploration.
