You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Self-sufficient nuclear fuel technology development and applications A cutting-edge nuclear fuel technology in Korea has been acquired through four stepwise nuclear fuel technology development phases starting from the 1970s that may include a fuel import phase, a turnkey fuel technology transfer phase, a fuel technology joint-development phase and a self-sufficient fuel technology development phase. The self-sufficient fuel technology development procedures have been applied for developing four kinds of advanced PWR fuels such as PLUS7, 16ACE7, 17ACE7 and HIPER, an advanced cladding material of HANA and various fuel performance analysis computer codes. The PLUS7, 16ACE7 and 17ACE7 fuels have already been implemented on a batch scale in the PWRs operating in Korea. Based on the forty years’ operation experience of the PWRs in Korea and various fuel verification/validation test databases acquired from the advanced fuel developments, main fuel failure causes observed in the PWRs seem to be grid-to-rod fretting wear, debris-induced wear and accelerated Zry-4 cladding corrosion. Outstanding countermeasures against such main fuel failures are proposed to accomplish an ultimate goal of zero fuel defects for the aforementioned advanced fuels.
