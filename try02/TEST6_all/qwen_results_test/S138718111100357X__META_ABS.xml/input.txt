Porous structure and adsorptive properties of pineapple peel based activated carbons prepared via microwave assisted KOH and K2CO3 activation The present research explores the feasibility of microwave irradiation for preparation of high surface area activated carbon from pineapple peel (PPAC), an agricultural effluent emitted from the food can processing industries via KOH and K2CO3 activation. The activation process was performed at the microwave power of 600W and irradiation time of 6min. The equilibrium behavior of PPAC was investigated by performing batch adsorption experiments using methylene blue as adsorbate. Nonlinear adsorption isotherm models, Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin were used to simulate the equilibrium data. KOH activated sample demonstrated a better development of pore structure, with the BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore size of 1006m2/g, 0.59m3/g and 23.44Å, respectively, while the monolayer adsorption capacity of methylene blue was determined to be 462.10mg/g. The findings support the potential use of microwave assisted KOH and K2CO3 activation as a promising activation technique.
