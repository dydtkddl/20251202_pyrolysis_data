You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical study of the effect of the inlet gas distributor on the bubble distribution in a bubbling fluidized bed Gas bubble distribution is considered one of the most critical factors affecting the Industrial Fluid Coking™ process since it influences the formation of wet agglomerates that causes fouling in the stripper section. A multi-phase Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid method (TFM) coupled with the kinetic theory of the granular flow (KTGF) was used to investigate the hydrodynamics of a bubbling fluidized bed; the goal is to increase the flow of gas bubbles into the first half of the jet cavity formed when liquid is sprayed into the fluidized bed, thus reducing the formation of wet agglomerates. The numerical simulations under different superficial gas velocities, different gas distributor geometries, and different gas distributor inclined angles were carried out. The results showed that the predicted bubble distributions at the injection level under the lab and commercial operating conditions are similar although the particles and gases are different under those two operating conditions. More gas bubbles can be directed to the first half of the jet cavity by either increasing the gas superficial velocity (directing around 20% more gas to the specified area) or using the proposed new gas distributor (directing around 30% more gas to the specified area). The effect of the inlet gas distributor configuration on the bubble distribution is much more substantial when the inclined angle of the gas distributor is large.
