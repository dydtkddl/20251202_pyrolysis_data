You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-occurrence of microplastics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Júcar River basin (E Spain): The benchmark before 2024's floods The south of the province of Valencia (Spain) is characterised by high flood risk and, in October 2024, Júcar River tributaries were partially responsible for catastrophic floods in the area related to the influence of global warming. The floods carried large amounts of water and sediment and, with them, many pollutants such as microplastics (MPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Co-occurrence of MPs and PAHs was investigated in water, sediment and fish samples from the Júcar River basin to set a benchmark of pollution in this flood susceptible area, only four months before the October 2024 catastrophe. Extractions were optimized based on matrix and compound type. Analyses were performed by micro-FTIR, Pyrolysis coupled with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) and GC–MS/MS, and ecological and human health risks were, also, estimated for the determined pollutants. Both MPs and PAHs were detected in the majority of samples, with higher concentrations near the river mouth (up to 100 ± 3.8 MPs Kg −1 and 2017.4 ± 107.8 ng g−1 of total PAHs), located close to the metropolitan area of Valencia and its industrial zone. One fish sample (A. alburnus) presented a concentration of 19.97 ± 1.1 μg g−1 of polypropylene (PP) and was contaminated by 11 PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene (14.2 ± 1.2 ng g−1). Incremental life cancer risk values for MPs and PAHs ranged from 1.7 × 10−6 to 3.1 × 10−4 for all water samples where PAHs were detected, and for the highly polluted fish sample (14.5 × 10−3 and 7.7 × 10−5), indicating potential risk. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested positive correlation between PP, benzo[a]pyrene and potential cancer risk. This is the first study that provides data on both MPs and PAHs ecological and human health risk assessment in the same environmental samples from a river catchment and establish a benchmark for these pollutants before flooding.
