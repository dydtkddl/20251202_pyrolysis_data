Liberation of plastic nanoparticles and organic compounds from three common plastics in water during weathering under UV radiation-free conditions A 620-day batch experiment was conducted to examine the generation of nano-sized plastic particles and migration of organic compounds derived from plastic additives and impurities during the weathering of three common plastic types in water with and without reactive oxygen species. The results show that the amount of nanoplastics plus organic compounds liberated from the tested plastic films, as indicated by total organic carbon, was in the following decreasing order: PET >PP > ABS. Hydroxyl radical generated from Fenton-like reaction significantly enhanced the generation of nanoplastics and release of organic compounds from the weathered plastic films via oxidative degradation. Over 30 organic compounds including potentially toxic organic pollutants originated from plastic additives and impurities were detected. There was a marked difference in the plastic nanoparticle size distribution between the deionized water and the water containing reactive oxygen species. The strong oxidizing capacity of hydroxyl radical resulted in rapider disintegration of the coarser nanoparticles (>500 nm) into the finer nanoparticles (<500 nm) and allowed complete decomposition of the nanoplastics with a size <50 nm or even <100 nm. Elevated level of Ca was detected on the surfaces of the ABS and PP nanoparticles. PP- and PET-derived nanoplastics contained heavy metal(loid)s while no heavy metal(loid)s was detected for the ABS nanoparticles. PET nanoparticles had a stronger capacity to bind S- and N-containing organic ligands compared to the other two plastic nanoparticles. The nanoplastics generated from the weathering were irregular in shape, which means that they had larger specific area compared to spherical engineered nanoplastics.
