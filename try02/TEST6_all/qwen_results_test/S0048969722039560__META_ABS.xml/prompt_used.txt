You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liberation of plastic nanoparticles and organic compounds from three common plastics in water during weathering under UV radiation-free conditions A 620-day batch experiment was conducted to examine the generation of nano-sized plastic particles and migration of organic compounds derived from plastic additives and impurities during the weathering of three common plastic types in water with and without reactive oxygen species. The results show that the amount of nanoplastics plus organic compounds liberated from the tested plastic films, as indicated by total organic carbon, was in the following decreasing order: PET >PP > ABS. Hydroxyl radical generated from Fenton-like reaction significantly enhanced the generation of nanoplastics and release of organic compounds from the weathered plastic films via oxidative degradation. Over 30 organic compounds including potentially toxic organic pollutants originated from plastic additives and impurities were detected. There was a marked difference in the plastic nanoparticle size distribution between the deionized water and the water containing reactive oxygen species. The strong oxidizing capacity of hydroxyl radical resulted in rapider disintegration of the coarser nanoparticles (>500 nm) into the finer nanoparticles (<500 nm) and allowed complete decomposition of the nanoplastics with a size <50 nm or even <100 nm. Elevated level of Ca was detected on the surfaces of the ABS and PP nanoparticles. PP- and PET-derived nanoplastics contained heavy metal(loid)s while no heavy metal(loid)s was detected for the ABS nanoparticles. PET nanoparticles had a stronger capacity to bind S- and N-containing organic ligands compared to the other two plastic nanoparticles. The nanoplastics generated from the weathering were irregular in shape, which means that they had larger specific area compared to spherical engineered nanoplastics.
