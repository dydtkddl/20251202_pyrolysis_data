You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced catalytic efficiency of CeO2/BC@Fe3O4 magnetic catalyst in activating peroxymonosulfate for effective degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent organic pollutants that are widely present in aquatic environments and pose a significant threat to the ecological environment and human health. This study introduces a novel magnetic biochar-supported metal oxide catalyst (CeO2/BC@Fe3O4, CBF) as a peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activator in phenanthrene (PHE) degradation in aqueous environments. The degradation performance of the CeO2/BC@Fe3O4 composite material was investigated through degradation experiments. The results showed that under the optimal reaction conditions, the degradation efficiency of 20 mg/L PHE solution within 60 min could reach 99.55 % and maintained stability within a wide range of pH values. Radical quenching and EPR studies confirmed the involvement of SO4 ·-, ·OH and 1O2 in the removal of PHE during the degradation process. The possible degradation pathways were proposed based on the identification of intermediates. The catalyst demonstrated excellent reusability and was effective in real water samples and for other organic pollutants, highlighting its potential for practical environmental applications.
