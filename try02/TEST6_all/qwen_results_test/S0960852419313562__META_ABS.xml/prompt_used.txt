You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigations on pyrolysis of microalgae Diplosphaera sp. MM1 by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS: Products and kinetics In this work, pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics of microalgae Diplosphaera sp. MM1 cultivated in different mediums were investigated by TG-FTIR and Py-GC/MS. Harvested MM1s biomass varied with the changing in proximate and ultimate analyses presented different weight loss behaviors. The weight loss of MM1s cultivated in dairy and winery wastewater in main pyrolysis region was ~48.4 wt% and ~52.9 wt%, respectively, and both showed secondary weight loss after 570 °C. However, MM1 harvested from BG-11 medium exhibited maximum weight loss of ~63.5 wt% and no secondary weight loss. Further, the activation energies of MM1s harvested from dairy and winery wastewater (176.3 kJ/mol and 130.4 kJ/mol, respectively) were lower than that of BG-11medium (189.4 kJ/mol). The best mechanism function for MM1s pyrolysis was third-order f(α) = (1-α)3. Py-GC/MS results of MM1 cultivated in winery wastewater showed highest contents of C4–C10 and C11–C21 that characterized the carbon level of gasoline and diesel, respectively, which are the major components of bio-oils.
