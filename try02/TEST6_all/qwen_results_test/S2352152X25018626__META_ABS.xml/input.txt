An effective B-doped strategy to regulate the closed-pore formation of hard carbon nanospheres for sodium-ion batteries Hard carbon (HC) is considered one of the most promising anode materials for commercial applications in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its poor capacity and low initial Coulombic efficiency hamper its practical applications. In our work, the boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon spheres are obtained via a co-assembly process with boric acid and self-doped N Potato residue derived from the potato starch processing waste liquid. This heteroatom doping strategy effectively introduces B into the naturally N-doped carbon skeleton, creating a suitable hierarchical porous structure (open pores) and generating more closed pores. The hierarchical porous structure alleviates the volume expansion and shortens the diffusion path of Na+. Closed pores play an important role in enhancing the plateau capacity of HC at low voltage. Accordingly, the as-prepared electrode shows a remarkable reversible capacity of 315.4 mAh g−1 at 0.05 A g−1. Meanwhile, it also exhibits stable cycling performances over 1000 cycles, with a high reversible capacity of 180.5 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1. Thus, this work provides a new insight for designing and developing low-cost, abundant sources, and long-life anodes for SIBs.
