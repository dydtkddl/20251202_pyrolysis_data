Computational models and methods for continuous gaseous turbulent combustion Computational methods used to simulate turbulent reacting flow in combustors of complex shape are presented. The physical sub-models include either chemically equilibrated or partially-equilibrated (radical pool) models of varying complexity and laminar flamelet models. Limitations of turbulence models are discussed. Some results in non-premixed jet flames are reviewed showing the effects of non-equilibrium phenomena on major and minor species, temperature and pollutants. An algorithm applicable to recirculating flow in bodies with arbitrarily contoured boundaries is developed. Issues governing the choice of grid systems, discretization operators, and numerical solution procedures for recirculating flows are emphasized. Numerical results illustrate these issues. The method is demonstrated by application to a modern annular gas-turbine combustor.
