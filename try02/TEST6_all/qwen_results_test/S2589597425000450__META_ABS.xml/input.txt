Interfacial catalysis in enzymatic PET plastic depolymerization Interfacial catalysis at the solid/liquid interface plays a crucial role in numerous natural and industrial processes, including the enzymatic depolymerization of plastic waste. Significant advancements have been made in the discovery and engineering of various polyester hydrolases applicable for bio-based poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) recycling. However, our mechanistic understanding of the polymer surface erosion processes caused by biocatalytic depolymerization is still in its early stages. Herein, we seek to understand how the interfacial characteristics between polymers and enzymes, as well as their interaction, reaction kinetics, and mass transfer processes, influence the rate and extent of enzymatic depolymerization. We anticipate that bridging the gap between protein and process engineering will pave the way to engineer better biocatalysts and accelerate plastic waste bioprocessing.
