You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Additive friction stir deposition of metallic materials: Process, structure and properties Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) is a relatively new additive manufacturing technique to fabricate parts in solid state below the melting temperature. Due to the solid-state nature, AFSD benefits from lower residual stresses as well as significantly lower susceptibility to porosity, hot-cracking, and other defects compared to conventional fusion-based metallic additive manufacturing. These unique features make AFSD a promising alternative to conventional forging for fabricating large structures for aerospace, naval, nuclear, and automotive applications. This review comprehensively summarizes the advances in AFSD, as well as the microstructure and properties of the final part. Given the rapidly growing research in AFSD, we focus on fundamental questions and issues, with a particular emphasis on the underlying relationship between AFSD-based processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The implications of the experimental and modeling research in AFSD will be discussed in detail. Unlike the columnar structure in fusion-based additive manufacturing, fully dense material with a fine, fully-equiaxed microstructure can be fabricated in AFSD. The as-wrought structure brings the as-printed parts with comparable properties to wrought parts. The fundamental difference between AFSD and fusion-based metallic additive manufacturing will be summarized. Furthermore, the existing challenges and possible future research directions are explored.
