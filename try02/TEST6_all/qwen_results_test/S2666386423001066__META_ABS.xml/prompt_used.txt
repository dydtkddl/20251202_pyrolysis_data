You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-catalyzed plastic depolymerization Polymers have become an indispensable part of our daily lives, and today we produce around 370 MT of plastic per year. Only about 20% of it is being recycled, and the rest, 80%, is unleashed into the environment without appropriate treatment. This calls forth the evaluation of strategies available for mitigating the menace of “after-use” plastic waste. Various approaches have evolved over a decade and are at different levels of development. Plastic depolymerization and upcycling are considered some of the most prominent and long-term solutions. The metal-catalyzed depolymerization of plastic waste to chemical feedstocks has emerged as one of the promising ways to address global plastic pollution. Therefore, this review aims to examine the available metal-catalyzed depolymerization methods, notify recent progress, pinpoint current gaps, and gauge the potential of this strategy. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to depolymerize various polymers over the last decade. Considerable advances have been reported in the metal-mediated depolymerization of polyolefins, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyamides, and polyethers. The depolymerization of the above polymers produces the monomers or intermediates, which can be used again for polymerization and thus brings the waste polymers back into circularity. The overview debates the usage of high temperatures, sophisticated ligands, expensive metals, stoichiometric reagents, etc., in metal-catalyzed depolymerization. Thus, this review summarizes the current understanding of the fundamental science of metal-catalyzed plastic depolymerization, the remaining scientific challenges, and the potential opportunities.
