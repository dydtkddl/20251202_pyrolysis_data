You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on production, modification and utilization of biochar There has been an increased interest in the production of sustainable biochar in the past years, as biochar shows versatile physicochemical properties and, can have a wide applicability in diverse fields. Comprehensive studies have been made to characterize biochar produced from various biomass materials, using different production technologies and under different process conditions. However, research is still lacking in correlating biochar properties needed for certain applications with (i) feedstock, (ii) biochar production processes and conditions and (iii) biochar upgrading and modification strategies. To produce biochar with desired properties, there is a great need to establish and clarify such correlations, which can guide the selection of feedstock, tuning and optimization of the production process and more efficient utilization of biochar. On the other hand, further elucidation of these correlations is also important for biochar-stakeholder and end-users for predicting physiochemical properties of biochar from certain feedstock and production conditions, assessing potential effects of biochar utilization and clearly address needs towards biochar critical properties. This review summarizes a wide range of literature on the impact of feedstocks and production processes and reactions conditions on the biochar properties and the most important biochar properties required for the different potential applications. Based on collected data, recommendations are provided for mapping out biochar production for different biochar applications. Knowledge gaps and perspectives for future research have also been identified regarding the characterization and production of biochar.
