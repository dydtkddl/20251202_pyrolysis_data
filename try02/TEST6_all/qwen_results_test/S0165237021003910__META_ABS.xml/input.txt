A critical review on production, modification and utilization of biochar There has been an increased interest in the production of sustainable biochar in the past years, as biochar shows versatile physicochemical properties and, can have a wide applicability in diverse fields. Comprehensive studies have been made to characterize biochar produced from various biomass materials, using different production technologies and under different process conditions. However, research is still lacking in correlating biochar properties needed for certain applications with (i) feedstock, (ii) biochar production processes and conditions and (iii) biochar upgrading and modification strategies. To produce biochar with desired properties, there is a great need to establish and clarify such correlations, which can guide the selection of feedstock, tuning and optimization of the production process and more efficient utilization of biochar. On the other hand, further elucidation of these correlations is also important for biochar-stakeholder and end-users for predicting physiochemical properties of biochar from certain feedstock and production conditions, assessing potential effects of biochar utilization and clearly address needs towards biochar critical properties. This review summarizes a wide range of literature on the impact of feedstocks and production processes and reactions conditions on the biochar properties and the most important biochar properties required for the different potential applications. Based on collected data, recommendations are provided for mapping out biochar production for different biochar applications. Knowledge gaps and perspectives for future research have also been identified regarding the characterization and production of biochar.
