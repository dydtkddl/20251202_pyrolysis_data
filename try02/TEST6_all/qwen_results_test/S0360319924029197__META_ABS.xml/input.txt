Investigation of pyrolysis productions (pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes) distribution in co-pyrolysis of torrefied oiltea camellia shells and polypropylene The co-pyrolysis of torrefied oiltea camellia shells (OCS) and reused polypropylene (PP) was investigated for pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) distribution characters in a two-stage pyrolysis system. Compared with raw OCS/PP, the quality of pyrolysis oil from torrefied OCS and PP was upgraded while yield decreased gradually. In particular, torrefaction pretreatment was beneficial to the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the higher selectivity of phenols in pyrolysis oil. And serious N2 torrefaction (260 N) and slight CO2 torrefaction (200C) is more conducive to the synthesis of C6–C11 (gasoline component). In addition, torrefaction could contribute to lower volatiles, which resulted in a lower yield of CNTs. For comparison, higher graphitized CNTs was prepared from the co-pyrolysis of torrefied OCS and PP. Appropriate torrefaction temperature and atmosphere have a potential for high value conversion of pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and CNTs from co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.
