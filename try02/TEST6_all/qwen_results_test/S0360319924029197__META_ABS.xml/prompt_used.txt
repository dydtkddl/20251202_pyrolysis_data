You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of pyrolysis productions (pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes) distribution in co-pyrolysis of torrefied oiltea camellia shells and polypropylene The co-pyrolysis of torrefied oiltea camellia shells (OCS) and reused polypropylene (PP) was investigated for pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) distribution characters in a two-stage pyrolysis system. Compared with raw OCS/PP, the quality of pyrolysis oil from torrefied OCS and PP was upgraded while yield decreased gradually. In particular, torrefaction pretreatment was beneficial to the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the higher selectivity of phenols in pyrolysis oil. And serious N2 torrefaction (260 N) and slight CO2 torrefaction (200C) is more conducive to the synthesis of C6–C11 (gasoline component). In addition, torrefaction could contribute to lower volatiles, which resulted in a lower yield of CNTs. For comparison, higher graphitized CNTs was prepared from the co-pyrolysis of torrefied OCS and PP. Appropriate torrefaction temperature and atmosphere have a potential for high value conversion of pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and CNTs from co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics.
