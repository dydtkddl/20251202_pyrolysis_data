  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study involves co-pyrolysis of torrefied biomass (oiltea camellia shells) and polypropylene, but the primary focus is on biomass-derived feedstock with plastic as a co-feed, and the abstract lacks clear experimental data on plastic pyrolysis alone, making it ambiguous whether the core work is on plastic pyrolysis."
