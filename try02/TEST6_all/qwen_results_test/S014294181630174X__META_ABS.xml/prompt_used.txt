You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a multi-sample micro UV irradiator for accelerated deterioration of polymers The authors previously developed a pyrolysis-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) system incorporating a micro ultraviolet (UV) irradiator which allowed more rapid deterioration of polymeric materials compared to outdoor exposure tests and various accelerated weathering test methods such as weather meters. The micro UV irradiator, however, could handle only a single sample at a time. To achieve multi-sample deterioration in a short time, herein a new UV irradiator was developed by which up to 18 samples on a rotatable sample cup holder can be simultaneously deteriorated at a desired temperature under UV irradiation. The basic performance of the irradiator is evaluated in terms of the rate and reproducibility of accelerated deterioration by using high impact polystyrene (HIPS) as the test sample. The HIPS samples before and after deterioration are subjected to evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry (EGA-MS) focusing on the changes in the peak width observed in the thermograms. High precision in the peak width measurements among the samples irradiated at various positions on the rotatable sample cup holder is observed with RSD values less than 4.3%. The newly developed irradiator for multi-samples requires a six times longer period to accomplish a comparable deterioration level than the previously developed irradiator. This lengthening can be attributed to the difference in the light intensities of both irradiators at the sample position. However, the relationship between the peak width and the irradiation time has similar profiles for both irradiators. This similarity indicates a good correlation of data measured by both irradiators.
