You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress in modified carbon support materials for Pt and Pt-alloy cathode catalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells H2-fed polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most advanced fuel cell technology to date and continue to be of great interest as prospective energy sources in numerous applications, including for low/zero-emission electric vehicles, distributed power generators in homes, and small portable electronic devices. However, the commercialization of PEMFC technology has been greatly hindered by certain challenges, mainly the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode and the high cost of Pt-based cathode catalysts, the latter presently accounting for over 55% of the total PEMFC cost. To overcome the limited stability of state-of-the-art Pt/C, Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts supported on modified carbon materials have garnered significant interest in recent years. It is therefore timely to compile a review that focuses on Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts supported on modified carbon materials, examining their current R&D status, applications, challenges, and future prospects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of current Pt and Pt-alloy PEMFC cathode catalysts in terms of materials selection and design, synthesis methods, and structural features, emphasizing how these various aspects relate to the catalysts’ physicochemical characterization and performance, and with the aim of shedding light on the future direction of PEMFC research.
