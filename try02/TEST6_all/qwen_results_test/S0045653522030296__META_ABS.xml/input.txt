Adsorption of potentially harmful elements by metal-biochar prepared via Co-pyrolysis of coffee grounds and Nano Fe(III) oxides Nano Fe(III) oxide (FO) was used as an amendment material in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of spent coffee grounds (SCG) and its impacts on the syngas (H2 & CO) generation and biochar adsorptive properties were investigated. Amendment of FO led to 153 and 682% increase of H2 and CO in pyrolytic process of SCG, respectively, which is deemed to arise from enhanced thermal cracking of hydrocarbons and oxygen transfer reaction mediated by FO. Incorporation of FO successfully created porous structure in the produced biochar. The adsorption tests revealed that the biochar exhibited bi-functional capability to remove both positively charged Cd(II) and Ni(II), and negatively charged Sb(V). The adsorption of Cd(II) and Ni(II) was hardly deteriorated in the multiple adsorption cycles, and the adsorption of Sb(V) was further enhanced through formation of surface ternary complexes. The overall results demonstrated nano Fe(III) oxide is a promising amendment material in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for enhancing syngas generation and producing functional biochar.
