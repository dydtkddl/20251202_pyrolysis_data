You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption of potentially harmful elements by metal-biochar prepared via Co-pyrolysis of coffee grounds and Nano Fe(III) oxides Nano Fe(III) oxide (FO) was used as an amendment material in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of spent coffee grounds (SCG) and its impacts on the syngas (H2 & CO) generation and biochar adsorptive properties were investigated. Amendment of FO led to 153 and 682% increase of H2 and CO in pyrolytic process of SCG, respectively, which is deemed to arise from enhanced thermal cracking of hydrocarbons and oxygen transfer reaction mediated by FO. Incorporation of FO successfully created porous structure in the produced biochar. The adsorption tests revealed that the biochar exhibited bi-functional capability to remove both positively charged Cd(II) and Ni(II), and negatively charged Sb(V). The adsorption of Cd(II) and Ni(II) was hardly deteriorated in the multiple adsorption cycles, and the adsorption of Sb(V) was further enhanced through formation of surface ternary complexes. The overall results demonstrated nano Fe(III) oxide is a promising amendment material in CO2-assisted pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for enhancing syngas generation and producing functional biochar.
