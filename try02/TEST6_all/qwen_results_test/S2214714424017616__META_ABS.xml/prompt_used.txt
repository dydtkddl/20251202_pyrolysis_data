You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Immobilization of solar light-active photocatalyst Cr-TiO2 into the polyurethane/polycaprolactone electrospun membrane for the photocatalytic oxidation of Acid Orange 7 The considerable presence of organic pollutants, such as Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye, in wastewater poses significant environmental challenges, necessitating the development of efficient and sustainable purification methods. In this study, we investigated the use of photocatalytic polymeric membranes (PPMs) based on the use of polyurethane (PU)/polycaprolactone (PCL) for the oxidation of AO7 under solar light irradiation on a sol-gel chromium-doped TiO2 visible active photocatalyst. Our objective was to realize a directly separable and easily recyclable photocatalyst. The photocatalyst was embedded into PU/PCL fibres via electrospinning, with catalyst loadings of 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % (w/w). The good dispersion of the photocatalyst within the fibrous membrane was evidenced by SEM-EDX, Raman, UV–Vis DRS, TGA-DTG and SSA measurements. The effect of catalyst load, pH of the solution, and initial concentration of dye was examined in AO7 photooxidation. Photocatalytic efficiency markedly increases up to 20 % w/w. The greater photocatalytic activity was recorded by treating the solution with 5 ppm of dye and pH = 2, leading to a conversion of 99 % after 3 h. A statistical approach was used to model the AO7 photodegradation by adopting a polynomial equation while scavenger studies suggested a photocatalytic mechanism primarily driven by hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl and superoxide radicals. Additionally, a comparison of the electrical energy consumption (EE/O) under the optimal operating demonstrates a substantial reduction in EE/O with the application of electrospun composite. This result highlights the superior energy efficiency of the easily recoverable photocatalytic system implemented in this work. These findings underscore the potential of PPMs as a sustainable technology for self-cleaning applications within hybrid wastewater treatment systems and underline the valuable role of electrospinning in the development of efficient, solar-active photocatalytic processes.
