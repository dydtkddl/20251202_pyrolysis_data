You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PHB/PBAT blended melt-blown micro-nano fiber carbon source for efficient solid-phase denitrification: Insights into low-carbon treatment and enhanced mechanism Advanced biocompatible materials are critical for controlling nitrogen pollution in water. To address low efficiency and high consumption of conventional materials, this study introduces a novel biodegradable polymer-based micro-nano fiber carbon source, synthesized via melt-blowing technology, blending poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) with polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT). This innovative design enhanced the specific surface area and porosity of the carbon source, with an average pore diameter of 59.66 μm and a fiber diameter of 11.61 μm. Compared to scraped film of the same composition, the micro-nano fiber enhanced denitrification efficiency, with higher 96.5% nitrate removal (53.44 mg NO3 −-N/d), negligible nitrite accumulation (0.008 mg/L) and slightly higher ammonium levels (0.67 mg/L) in 75 days. Morphological analysis revealed a reduction in pore size (59.66 μm to 28.00 μm) and enhanced degradation, marked by a 52.6% ester carbonyl cleavage rate and a 7.91% reduction in crystallinity. Dissolved organic matter analysis indicated stronger carbon release and active microbial metabolism without recalcitrant by-products. The phylum Proteobacteria dominated the microbial community, exhibiting 5.5% and 4.9% higher colonization levels on micro-nano fiber in batch and reactor system. Metagenomic analysis showed increased abundances of PHB degradation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) genes. Mechanism analysis yielded that the micro-nano fiber improved microbial immobilization, gene expression, material degradation, and carbon supply, thereby enhancing denitrification. The consumption of micro-nano fibers was quantified at 0.82 kg/kg NO3 −-N, with a projected lifespan exceeding 800 days. This study provides a basis for designing advanced biocompatible materials that enhance solid-phase denitrification efficiency in water treatment.
