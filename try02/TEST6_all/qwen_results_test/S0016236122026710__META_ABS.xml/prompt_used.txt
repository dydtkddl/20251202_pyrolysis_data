You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanism research on hydrogen production from catalytic pyrolysis of waste tire rubber Waste tires are currently disposed of through various approaches such as landfill and incineration, which not only causes environmental pollution, but also lead to the wastage of resources. As an important type of solid waste, tire rubber has a high carbon-to-hydrogen ratio, which makes it a good material for hydrogen production from pyrolysis. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations combined with experimental methods are used to explore the mechanism of hydrogen production from the catalytic pyrolysis (CP) of waste tire rubber (WTR) over Ni, ZSM-5 and Ni/ZSM-5. The simulation results show that the three catalysts potentially promote the release of hydrogen radicals from monomers and facilitate attack by H· radicals to generate hydrogen. Compared with ZSM-5 and Ni, the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst exerts better catalytic effects, leading to higher contents of produced H2 and hydrocarbons. In the low-temperature stage, the long chain cracks into monomer compounds, which mainly include isoprene, styrene, and 1,3-butadiene. Meanwhile, in the high-temperature stage, free radicals attack monomers to generate small molecules. The main gas products from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tire rubber are hydrogen, methane, and ethylene. The use of all three catalysts leads to a low final catalytic pyrolysis temperature, high catalytic pyrolysis rate, and excellent catalytic effect. This work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics for the formation mechanisms of gaseous products, primarily hydrogen.
