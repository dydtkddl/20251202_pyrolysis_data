You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from five commercial bioplastics via acidogenic fermentation The feasibility of producing volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from five commercial bioplastics via acidogenic fermentation by a non-pretreated anaerobic sludge was investigated. Mesophilic, anaerobic, acidogenic batch assays at 1, 10 and 20 g/L feed concentrations revealed the feasibility of producing VFAs from polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), i.e., PHB and PHBV, but not from PBS, PCL and PLA under the test conditions and time. However, only high PHA substrate concentrations (10–20 g/L) resulted in organic overloading and decreasing the pH of the culture broth down to 4–5, which in turn induced the accumulation of VFAs via kinetic imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis. Gaseous carbon (C-CO2 and C-CH4) accounted for 8–35% of the total initial carbon, while C-VFAs represented 10–18%, mainly as acetate and butyrate. This study represents the first systematically assessed proof-of-concept to produce VFAs from PHA, which is key for the design of bioplastic-to-bioplastic recycling (bio)technologies.
