Thermogravimetric analysis of Limonia Acidissima shell for thermal-kinetic properties and thermodynamic characteristics This study presents a comprehensive thermokinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the Limonia Acidissima shell as a potential bioenergy source. Granulated and powdered forms of the shells were analysed using Thermogravimetric Analysis at three heating rates (10, 15, and 20°C/min) under nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal degradation process occurred in three phases: initial decomposition (30–100°C), main decomposition (100–400°C), and final decomposition (400–800°C), with 14.9% to 21.82% of the biomass remaining at 800°C. The main decomposition phase accounts for the substantial weight loss due to the breakdown of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Kinetic analysis using model-free methods (KAS, FWO, and FM) revealed that powdered material generally exhibited lower activation energies, indicating more efficient heat transfer, whereas granulated material showed more complex, multi-step decomposition. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that the powdered material required more energy for decomposition, with enthalpy ranging from 147.13 to 150.49 kJ/mol, compared to granulated material ranging from 108.20 to 126.31 kJ/mol. Gibbs free energy values for powdered were higher (335.97–339.39 kJ/mol) than granulated (299.66–316.69 kJ/mol), indicating that pyrolysis of powdered material is less thermodynamically favourable. The negative entropy changes suggest an increased system order during pyrolysis. The Higher Heating Value of the material, calculated as 15.40 MJ/kg, corresponds to an energy content of approximately 4.28 kWh/kg, offering significant potential for energy generation. This detailed comparison of materials provides insights that are critical for optimizing bioenergy production processes from the bioresidue, thereby contributing to sustainable energy development.
