You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric analysis of Limonia Acidissima shell for thermal-kinetic properties and thermodynamic characteristics This study presents a comprehensive thermokinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the Limonia Acidissima shell as a potential bioenergy source. Granulated and powdered forms of the shells were analysed using Thermogravimetric Analysis at three heating rates (10, 15, and 20°C/min) under nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal degradation process occurred in three phases: initial decomposition (30–100°C), main decomposition (100–400°C), and final decomposition (400–800°C), with 14.9% to 21.82% of the biomass remaining at 800°C. The main decomposition phase accounts for the substantial weight loss due to the breakdown of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Kinetic analysis using model-free methods (KAS, FWO, and FM) revealed that powdered material generally exhibited lower activation energies, indicating more efficient heat transfer, whereas granulated material showed more complex, multi-step decomposition. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrated that the powdered material required more energy for decomposition, with enthalpy ranging from 147.13 to 150.49 kJ/mol, compared to granulated material ranging from 108.20 to 126.31 kJ/mol. Gibbs free energy values for powdered were higher (335.97–339.39 kJ/mol) than granulated (299.66–316.69 kJ/mol), indicating that pyrolysis of powdered material is less thermodynamically favourable. The negative entropy changes suggest an increased system order during pyrolysis. The Higher Heating Value of the material, calculated as 15.40 MJ/kg, corresponds to an energy content of approximately 4.28 kWh/kg, offering significant potential for energy generation. This detailed comparison of materials provides insights that are critical for optimizing bioenergy production processes from the bioresidue, thereby contributing to sustainable energy development.
