You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis characteristics of polystyrene by biomass char-supported nanocatalysts Plastics originate from the synthesis of chemical products, and the regeneration of chemical products from waste plastics through catalytic pyrolysis helps to reduce the dependence on fossil resources and improve the treatment of waste, which is an important aspect of current sustainable social development. In this study, metasequoia was used as a biomass precursor and three porous char-supported nanocatalysts (Fe-MEC, Ni-MEC, and Co-MEC) were synthesized via a simple and feasible microwave heating method, which were then used as catalysts for the preparation of high-quality liquid oil from polystyrene powder via an ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis method. The results indicate that Fe-MEC, Ni-MEC, and Co-MEC possessed good pore structures due to the microwave-heating and catalytic effect of these metals, and metal nanoparticles are generated and uniformly anchored on the matrix of the char support. Using these catalysts, the yield of liquid product from polystyrene pyrolysis decreased slightly, while the gas yield increased slightly. Fe-MEC catalysis reached the highest liquid yield of 91% among the three catalysts. The catalysts can improve the yield of a series of high-value liquid products such as toluene, ethylbenzene, and α-methyl styrene. The catalysts also exhibited excellent cycle stability, and carbon nanotubes were formed which are less prone to deactivation.
