Polyhydroxyalkanoates: Next generation natural biomolecules and a solution for the world's future economy Petrochemical plastics have become a cause of pollution for decades and finding alternative plastics that are environmental friendly. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a biopolyester produced by microbial cells, has characteristics (biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic) that make it appropriate as a biodegradable plastic substance. The different forms of PHA make it suitable to a wide choice of products, from packaging materials to biomedical applications. The major challenge in commercialization of PHA is the cost of manufacturing. There are a lot of factors that could affect the efficiency of a development method. The development of new strategic parameters for better synthesis, including consumption of low cost carbon substrates, genetic modification of PHA-producing strains, and fermentational strategies are discussed. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop a method for the cost-effective production of PHAs. The isolation, analysis as well as characterization of PHAs are significant factors for any developmental process. Due to the biodegradable and biocompatible properties of PHAs, they are majorly used in biomedical applications such as vascular grafting, heart tissue engineering, skin tissue repairing, liver tissue engineering, nerve tissue engineering, bone tissue engineering, cartilage tissue engineering and therapeutic carrier. The emerging and interesting area of research is the development of self-healing biopolymer that could significantly broaden the operational life and protection of the polymeric materials for a broad range of uses. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers are considered as the green materials in place of petroleum-based plastics in the future.
