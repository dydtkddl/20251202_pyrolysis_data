You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microencapsulation approaches for the development of novel thermal energy storage systems and their applications Microencapsulated Phase Change Materials (MEPCMs) represent a breakthrough in the realm of thermal energy storage (TES), providing enhanced stability and expanding the scope of applications across diverse industries. Encapsulating phase change materials within microcapsules, significantly improved the thermal, chemical, and physical properties, thereby increasing the efficiency and reliability of TES systems. Integrating these microencapsulated PCMs into systems from domestic heating and cooling to industrial waste heat recovery can significantly curtail energy usage and improve thermal management. This review delves into the classification of PCMs, including inorganic, organic, and eutectic varieties, and examines the critical requirements for shell materials used in microencapsulation. Various encapsulation techniques, including chemical, physicochemical, and physico-mechanical methods, and characterization techniques for performance evaluation are discussed. The economic aspects of MEPCM-based TES systems are also considered, along with recent advances in microencapsulation techniques, highlighting the wide-ranging applications of MEPCMs in sectors such as solar energy storage, packaging, textiles, electronics, and building, underscoring their role in advancing sustainable energy solutions. This review will serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and industry professionals, offering valuable insights into the development, characterization, and application of MEPCMs, and guiding future innovations in thermal energy storage technologies.
