Dataset on flue gas composition during pyrolysis of polyoxymethylene in a fluidised bed with the possibility of incorporating CO2 The dataset presented in this article is the supplementary data for the research article titled “The pyrolysis and combustion of polyoxymethylene in a fluidised bed with the possibility of incorporating CO2” [1], in which possible paths of polyoxymethylene conversion in the fluidised bed made from cenospheres and by means of various fluidising gases (air, N2, CO2) were tested. The use of CO2 as fluidising gas was particularly interesting because above 600°C its incorporation into process products (i.e. CO-rich flue gas) was observed. The gaseous products were detected using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, Gasmet DX-4000) at intervals of a few seconds. The data on the concentration changes over time will allow to evaluate and verificate of new kinetic models of polyoxymethylene degradation with the possibility of incorporating CO2.
