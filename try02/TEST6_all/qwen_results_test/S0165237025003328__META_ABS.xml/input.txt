Recent advances in co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with plastic waste as a sustainable waste-to-energy solution toward a low-carbon economy: A bibliometric review of the last 5 years of research With the climate crisis, the demand for new sustainable fuels to diversify the global energy matrix has intensified. In this context, the co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic mixtures has emerged as a promising alternative. Therefore, this article proposes a bibliometric analysis, whose novelty lies in identifying thematic patterns, major advances, and challenges faced in the field during the period from 2020 to 2025. Data were extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science platforms, classified according to the PRISMA 2020 methodology as strongly related, weakly related, and unrelated, and analyzed using the VOSviewer and Bibliometrix software tools. From the initial 889 documents (Scopus: 281; WoS: 608), 337 were selected, indicating the scientific leadership of China and India, with a predominance of laboratory-scale studies (TRL 2–3). The recurring use of thermogravimetric analyzers and analytical systems, along with a growing interest in microwave-assisted pyrolysis, was identified. In the catalytic field, HZSM-5 zeolite stands out. Regarding feedstocks, biomass, such as wood and sawdust, prevails, typically combined with widely available polymers, including polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene. The analysis revealed five priority research fronts: (i) scaling up to pilot plants; (ii) low-cost catalysts; (iii) microwave-specific reactors; (iv) diversification of feedstocks, including hard-to-recycle plastics; and (v) strengthening international collaboration networks. These advancements are crucial to establishing co-pyrolysis as a strategic technology within the circular economy and energy transition, directly contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 7, 11, 12, and 13).
