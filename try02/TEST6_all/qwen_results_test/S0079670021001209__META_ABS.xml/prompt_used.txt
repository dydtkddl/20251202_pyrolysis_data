You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From plant phenols to novel bio-based polymers Replacing petroleum-based products with inexpensive, biorenewable, natural materials is important for sustainable development and will have a significant impact on the polymer industry and the environment. Biorenewable aliphatic and cycloaliphatic compounds are less competitive with counterparts with aromatic structures for advanced polymeric materials in terms of rigidity, hydrophobicity, as well as chemical and thermal stability. Biorenewable plant phenols represent a diverse class of chemicals with a great industrial significance due to their unique structures and high abundance. The depolymerization process of lignin into small bio-based phenols is a relatively new approach and has received a considerable attention recently. This process produces key intermediates, phenolic compounds that can be used to develop and design wide range of high performance biorenewable multifunctional polymers and composites. In this review article, the production of biorenewable phenols from natural sources such as lignin by energy-, catalytic-, enzymatic-assisted depolymerization processes will be summarized. The different chemical modifications and polymerization pathways to obtain bio-based polymers (e.g. vinyl ester resins, cyanate ester, epoxy, benzoxazine resins, etc.) will be discussed. In addition, this review article will conclude with an overview of current and potential future applications of the bio-sourced phenolic-based materials in a wide range of automotive, electrical, and medical applications. Overall, the present review article will provide a quantitative experimental basis for the depolymerization process of lignin to produce biorenewable multifunctional phenolic-based polymers to increase our level of understanding of the behavior of this important class of polymeric materials and other similar bio-based polymers.
