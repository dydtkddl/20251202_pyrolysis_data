You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignin-driven hydrogen production from biomass via supercritical water gasification: Temperature-dependent efficiency and mechanistic pathways Hydrogen production via biomass supercritical water gasification (SCWG) presents a promising pathway toward carbon-neutral energy systems, yet the role of lignin—a recalcitrant biomass component—in gasification efficiency and reaction mechanisms remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates SCWG of four lignocellulosic feedstocks with varying lignin abundance (water hyacinth, corn straw, pine sawdust, walnut shell) at 450–600 ℃, elucidating lignin’s temperature-dependent influence on hydrogen yield, selectivity, and reaction pathways. The effects of temperature and lignin abundance on the distribution of SCWG three-phase products were investigated through detailed molecular characterization. The results show that higher reaction temperatures significantly boost total gas yield and hydrogen selectivity, promoting steam reforming and methanation reactions. Critically, lignin’s contribution to gasification efficiency shifts from negligible at 450–500 ℃ to dominant at 550–600 ℃, with walnut shell (highest lignin: 38.2 wt%) achieving peak hydrogen gasification efficiency (98.93 %) and selectivity (61.65 %) at 600 ℃. Liquid-phase analysis identifies phenolic compounds as terminal refractory intermediates, peaking at 79.90 % concentration and underscoring lignin’s resistance to degradation. By decoupling the transformation pathways of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and plant proteins, this work reveals that lignin-derived aromatics act as hydrogen sinks below 500 ℃ but become key hydrogen precursors at higher temperatures. These findings provide a mechanistic blueprint for optimizing SCWG processes tailored to biomass composition, advancing scalable and efficient hydrogen production. The study establishes lignin abundance as a critical lever for tuning gasification outcomes, offering actionable strategies to enhance the sustainability and practicality of SCWG in industrial applications.
