You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing plastic pyrolysis for carbon nanotubes synthesis through machine learning integration: A review The extensive use of plastic in daily life poses significant risks to the environment in recent years. Thus, transforming plastic waste into a valuable resource is essential to accomplish Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The pyrolysis process as an alternative solution is proposed for the conversion of plastic waste into products such as oils, gases, and chars. A search on the Scopus database yielded 355 studies since 2021 on "pyrolysis using machine learning (ML)". This study highlights the application of ML techniques to enhance predictive modelling in plastic pyrolysis processes. ML has been effectively implemented in various aspects of plastic pyrolysis. However, its application in the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has still not been fully explored. Various ML methods such as regression, decision trees, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are reviewed in terms of their effectiveness in predicting pyrolysis outcomes, considering different feedstock types, dataset sizes, and input/output variables. The study also addresses current challenges and prospects, focusing on the production of CNTs from plastic waste and optimizing pyrolysis conditions. In conclusion, integrating ML into plastic pyrolysis processes enhances both process efficiency and economic viability.
