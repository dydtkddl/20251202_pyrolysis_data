You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into multifarious heteroatom-doped/enriched carbon-based materials and their composites: Synthesis and Supercapacitor applications − A crucial review Chemically doped carbon-based candidates have emerged as a significant driving force across multifarious research domains including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), electrochemical sensing, energy storage and conversion, and solar cell technologies, etc., This comprehensive review takes a critical stance, shedding light on the exceptional supercapacitance performance found within heteroatom-doped/enriched carbon derivatives. This includes an array of candidates such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, boron carbonitride, g-C3N4, mesoporous carbon, ordered mesoporous carbon, and oxygen-enriched porous carbon. The review delves into diverse synthetic methodologies, encompassing chemical vapor deposition, thermal annealing, hydrothermal, microwave routes, and arc discharge techniques for each of these carbon-based materials. Furthermore, an in-depth exploration of the underlying electrochemical mechanisms governing supercapacitive performance is provided. Notably, the synthesis and energy storage proficiency of heteroatom-enriched materials like g-C3N4 and BCN are meticulously scrutinized. The influence of heteroatom doping on crucial characteristics like wettability, and porosity is deeply examined, boosted by compelling empirical substantiation. Adding intrigue, the merits, and drawbacks inherent to each synthetic approach are thoughtfully presented systematically. As a result, this article stands as a highly valuable resource, offering substantial support and insightful information tailored to young researchers. By furnishing a panoramic survey of diverse synthetic avenues and an in-depth analysis of supercapacitive performances across distinct classes of heteroatom-doped/enriched carbon materials, we aspire for this work to become an indispensable reference.
