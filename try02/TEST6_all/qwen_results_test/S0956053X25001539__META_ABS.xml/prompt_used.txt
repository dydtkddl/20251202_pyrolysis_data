You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Machine learning-assisted prediction of gas production during co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics A general method for predicting gas yield is crucial in biomass and plastics co-pyrolysis. This study employed two machine learning methods to forecast gas yield in co-pyrolysis. Comparing the predictive performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR) with an R2 of 0.72 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.15, while eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) demonstrated a superior performance with an R2 of 0.90 and an RMSE of 0.08. Therefore, XGBoost was selected as the final prediction model. Results obtained from the machine learning interpretation tool, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), revealed that the two most influential factors affecting gas yield were the highest co-pyrolysis temperature (HTT) and the blending ratio (BR), contributing 33% and 28% to the model’s predictions, respectively. Besides, the moisture content in biomass (MB) has been found to be one of the critical variables affecting the gaseous products yield. To determine the interaction between these factors and their contributions to gas yield, SHAP partial dependence analysis (SHAP PDA) was conducted. Therefore, this study offers novel insights into predicting gas yields in biomass and plastics co-pyrolysis, aiding in identifying optimal conditions for maximizing gas yield production.
