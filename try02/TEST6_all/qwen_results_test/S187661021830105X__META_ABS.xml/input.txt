Pyrolysis of Compact Disc (CD) Case Wastes to Produce Liquid Fuel as a Renewable Source of Electricity Generation The present study aims to investigate the thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of CD case wastes over natural zeolite catalyst. The effect of temperature and catalyst on product yields have been investigated for each condition. The thermal pyrolysis experiments were carried out at the reactor temperature of 400, 450, and 500°C. Furthermore, the effect of natural zeolite (NZ) catalyst on pyrolysis products was also studied at various catalyst to feedstock ratio. The results showed that the temperature and catalyst affected the products yield and liquid composition. CD case pyrolysis produced highest liquid fraction at the temperature of 450°C. Furthermore an estimated 5.74 kW of electricity can be generated by pyrolysis oil produced from CD case wastes at a recycling site in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia.
