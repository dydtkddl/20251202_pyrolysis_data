You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorisation of tyre waste from a vulcanisation plant by catalytic pyrolysis – Experimental investigations using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor This study focuses on the use of car tyre waste collected at a tyre repair station in Krakow (Poland). Waste from damaged tyres is disposed of as municipal solid waste. Therefore, the management of waste tyres already shredded by pyrolysis at 500 °C has been proposed. Tyre waste was hypothesised to be converted into valuable chemical products by pyrolysis in a hybrid reactor (drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor). On a micro scale, pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used to analyse the pyrolysis process. It has been shown that the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons during pyrolysis clearly depends on whether the catalyst and tyre waste are mixed together or arranged in layers. Since the layered arrangement favoured the formation of hydrocarbons, such a system was used in the drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor. The high heating rate (500 °C/s) of tyre particles in the drop-tube–fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C allowed for the obtained a raw carbon black yield of 40.8 %. A similar yield of raw carbon black determined by thermogravimetric analysis for a heating rate of 0.17 °C/s) was observed at 800 °C. However, before commercial use, raw carbon black requires demineralisation because of its high ash content (approximately 50 %). The raw carbon black ash contained up to 90 % SiO2, indicating that it could be a valuable catalyst material. Pyrolysis of tyre waste over the catalyst reduced the oxygen content in the oil and yield. The oil yields of tyre pyrolysis without a catalyst and over zeolite Y were 38 wt% and 35 wt%, respectively. The main components identified in the tyre pyrolysis gas were methane (27.6%), ethene (28.8%), and hydrogen (15.6%). The gas from catalytic pyrolysis was richer in CO and CO2.
