Preparation and in situ reduction of Ni/SiCxOy catalysts supported on porous SiC ceramic for ethanol steam reforming In this paper, Ni/SiCxOy/P–SiC was prepared as the core part of microreactor for the hydrogen production of ethanol steam reforming (ESR). The Ni/SiCxOy catalysts were supported on the porous SiC ceramic (P–SiC) by the inverse microemulsion process using the xylene solution of polycarbosilane (PCS) and the aqueous solution of nickel nitrate as the oil phase and the water phase, respectively. The morphology, loading strength and in situ reduction of the catalysts, and the performance of the catalysts for hydrogen production from ESR were investigated. The Ni catalyst particles exhibited a nearly spherical morphology and a narrow particle size distribution with an average particle size of 127 nm. The combination of the Ni/SiCxOy catalysts and the P–SiC, characterized by ultrasonic vibration for 300 s, showed good strength. Moreover, the ESR with Ni/SiCxOy/P–SiC as the core part of the catalytic microreactor showed that the ethanol conversion and selectivity of H2 were still up to 91% and 72% after 210 min, respectively.
