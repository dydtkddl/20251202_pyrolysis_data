You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and in situ reduction of Ni/SiCxOy catalysts supported on porous SiC ceramic for ethanol steam reforming In this paper, Ni/SiCxOy/P–SiC was prepared as the core part of microreactor for the hydrogen production of ethanol steam reforming (ESR). The Ni/SiCxOy catalysts were supported on the porous SiC ceramic (P–SiC) by the inverse microemulsion process using the xylene solution of polycarbosilane (PCS) and the aqueous solution of nickel nitrate as the oil phase and the water phase, respectively. The morphology, loading strength and in situ reduction of the catalysts, and the performance of the catalysts for hydrogen production from ESR were investigated. The Ni catalyst particles exhibited a nearly spherical morphology and a narrow particle size distribution with an average particle size of 127 nm. The combination of the Ni/SiCxOy catalysts and the P–SiC, characterized by ultrasonic vibration for 300 s, showed good strength. Moreover, the ESR with Ni/SiCxOy/P–SiC as the core part of the catalytic microreactor showed that the ethanol conversion and selectivity of H2 were still up to 91% and 72% after 210 min, respectively.
