You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste-to-energy: Pyrolysis-gasification conversion of packaging waste from both micro and macro perspectives The increasing volume of packaging waste, a representative component of municipal solid waste, has raised considerable environmental concerns. The present study conducted a detailed investigation into kinetic and thermodynamic of pyrolysis-gasification for post-consumer beverage cartons (BCs). Subsequently, the conversion was simulated using reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) to outline a proposed conversion pathway. Techno-economic assessment (TEA) was then conducted to evaluate economic performance of BCs conversion at different scales. The BCs decomposition could be divided into four stages of <375, 375–500, 500–800 and 800–900 °C with mass loss of 51.3–60.6, 19.0–25.3, 4.9–12.3 and 2.5–4.7 wt%, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and mass spectrometry confirmed the evolution of olefins, alkynes, and diolefins. The mean activation energy was calculated to be 60.2 kJ mol−1 within conversion of <0.60, which increased significantly to 205.9 kJ mol−1 for greater conversions. Positive changes in enthalpy and Gibbs free energy confirmed the endothermic and non-spontaneous nature of the pyrolysis-gasification reaction. The products generated and reactions involved in ReaxFF-MD simulation corresponded with the mass spectrometry results, indicating that β-scission of radicals was the predominant pathway for olefin formation. TEA analysis revealed that larger plants (45000 tonnes/a) had greater revenue potential, profitability, and positive returns on investment.
