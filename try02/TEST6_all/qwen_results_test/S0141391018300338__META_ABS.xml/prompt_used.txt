You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flame-retarding epoxy resin with an efficient P/N/S-containing flame retardant: Preparation, thermal stability, and flame retardance To further study the effect of the phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen-containing flame retardant on epoxy resin, a DOPO-based phenol derivative 4-[(benzothiazolyl 2-amino)(6-oxido-6H-dibenz[c,e][1,2]oxaphosphorin-6-yl) methyl] phenol namely D-P-A, was successfully synthesized from 9, 10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHBA), and 2-aminobenzothiazole (ABZ), and used to flame retard epoxy resin (EP). As expected, D-P-A imparted flame retardance to epoxy resin. For example, with 7.5 wt% loading of D-P-A, epoxy thermoset passed a UL-94 V-0 rating, and got a LOI value of 29.6%. Besides, D-P-A played an effective role in inhibiting heat release of EP, that EP/7.5% D-P-A showed a peak of heat release rate (PHRR) of 713 kW/m2 much lower than 1137 kW/m2 of EP. However, it decomposed in advance owing to the lower thermal stability of D-P-A. Finally, through Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Py-GC/MS), it disclosed that D-P-A exerted its flame-retardant activity both in the vapor and condensed phase.
