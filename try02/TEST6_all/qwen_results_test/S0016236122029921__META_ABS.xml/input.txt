Assessment of product distribution of plastic waste from catalytic pyrolysis process Plastic materials are disposed of in the environment sustainably, without knowing their serious effects. Studies have reported that over 700 species of animals in the ocean were affected due to the exposure of plastic waste. Several techniques are available to treat plastic waste. Initially, the plastic waste was incinerated and disposed of in landfills. During the year 2015, 20% of plastic was incinerated, only 20% was recycled and the remaining was simply scrapped. At the end of 2016, the incineration of plastics was increased to 79% and the left over was disposed of in landfills and used for energy recovery. This paper analysed the catalytic pyrolysis process and determined it to be the most desirable technique for recycling plastic waste. This study outlined the three types of product distribution that were similar to conventional fuel, which was evidently shown. The purpose of using catalyst in this process was to improve the quality of fuel and to reduce the amount of heat energy required for this process. Various factors affect product formation and their importance was discussed in this review. The link between the catalyst and product was described using different characterization methods. On analysing the catalytic pyrolysis products, their application looks enormous. Hence, this process was chosen as an appropriate method for treating plastic waste.
