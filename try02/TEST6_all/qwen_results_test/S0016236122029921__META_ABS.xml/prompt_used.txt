You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of product distribution of plastic waste from catalytic pyrolysis process Plastic materials are disposed of in the environment sustainably, without knowing their serious effects. Studies have reported that over 700 species of animals in the ocean were affected due to the exposure of plastic waste. Several techniques are available to treat plastic waste. Initially, the plastic waste was incinerated and disposed of in landfills. During the year 2015, 20% of plastic was incinerated, only 20% was recycled and the remaining was simply scrapped. At the end of 2016, the incineration of plastics was increased to 79% and the left over was disposed of in landfills and used for energy recovery. This paper analysed the catalytic pyrolysis process and determined it to be the most desirable technique for recycling plastic waste. This study outlined the three types of product distribution that were similar to conventional fuel, which was evidently shown. The purpose of using catalyst in this process was to improve the quality of fuel and to reduce the amount of heat energy required for this process. Various factors affect product formation and their importance was discussed in this review. The link between the catalyst and product was described using different characterization methods. On analysing the catalytic pyrolysis products, their application looks enormous. Hence, this process was chosen as an appropriate method for treating plastic waste.
