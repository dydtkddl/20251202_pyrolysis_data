You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biofuel from wastewater-grown microalgae: A biorefinery approach using hydrothermal liquefaction and catalyst upgrading Third-generation biofuels from microalgae are becoming necessary for sustainable energy. In this context, this study explores the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass grown in wastewater, consisting of 30% Chlorella vulgaris, 69% Tetradesmus obliquus, and 1% cyanobacteria Limnothrix planctonica, and the subsequent upgrading of the produced bio-oil. The novelty of the work lies in integrating microalgae cultivation in wastewater with HTL in a biorefinery approach, enhanced using a catalyst to upgrade the bio-oil. Different temperatures (300, 325, and 350 °C) and reaction times (15, 30, and 45 min) were tested. The bio-oil upgrading occurred with a Cobalt-Molybdenum (CoMo) catalyst for 1 h at 375 °C. Post-HTL, although the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio decreased from 1.70 to 1.38–1.60, the oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio also decreased from 0.39 to 0.079–0.104, and the higher heating value increased from 20.6 to 36.4–38.3 MJ kg−1. Palmitic acid was the main component in all bio-oil samples. The highest bio-oil yield was at 300 °C for 30 min (23.4%). Upgrading increased long-chain hydrocarbons like heptadecane (5%), indicating biofuel potential, though nitrogenous compounds such as hexadecanenitrile suggest a need for further hydrodenitrogenation. Aqueous phase, solid residues, and gas from HTL can be used for applications such as biomass cultivation, bio-hydrogen, valuable chemicals, and materials like carbon composites and cement additives, promoting a circular economy. The study underscores the potential of microalgae-derived bio-oil as sustainable biofuel, although further refinement is needed to meet current fuel standards.
