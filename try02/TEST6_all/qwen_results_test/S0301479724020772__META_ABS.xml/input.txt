Biofuel from wastewater-grown microalgae: A biorefinery approach using hydrothermal liquefaction and catalyst upgrading Third-generation biofuels from microalgae are becoming necessary for sustainable energy. In this context, this study explores the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae biomass grown in wastewater, consisting of 30% Chlorella vulgaris, 69% Tetradesmus obliquus, and 1% cyanobacteria Limnothrix planctonica, and the subsequent upgrading of the produced bio-oil. The novelty of the work lies in integrating microalgae cultivation in wastewater with HTL in a biorefinery approach, enhanced using a catalyst to upgrade the bio-oil. Different temperatures (300, 325, and 350 °C) and reaction times (15, 30, and 45 min) were tested. The bio-oil upgrading occurred with a Cobalt-Molybdenum (CoMo) catalyst for 1 h at 375 °C. Post-HTL, although the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio decreased from 1.70 to 1.38–1.60, the oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio also decreased from 0.39 to 0.079–0.104, and the higher heating value increased from 20.6 to 36.4–38.3 MJ kg−1. Palmitic acid was the main component in all bio-oil samples. The highest bio-oil yield was at 300 °C for 30 min (23.4%). Upgrading increased long-chain hydrocarbons like heptadecane (5%), indicating biofuel potential, though nitrogenous compounds such as hexadecanenitrile suggest a need for further hydrodenitrogenation. Aqueous phase, solid residues, and gas from HTL can be used for applications such as biomass cultivation, bio-hydrogen, valuable chemicals, and materials like carbon composites and cement additives, promoting a circular economy. The study underscores the potential of microalgae-derived bio-oil as sustainable biofuel, although further refinement is needed to meet current fuel standards.
