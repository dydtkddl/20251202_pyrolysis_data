A review on municipal solid waste pyrolysis of different composition for gas production Much research has focused on improving the treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) to obtain usable energy. Pyrolysis technology can not only reduce the volume of MSW, but also produce pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and char, which have high calorific value and application characteristics and widely used in industrial activities. In this paper, we review research on the pyrolysis of MSW according to its composition. The production and physical composition of MSW (including raw and excavated MSW) are introduced. The effects of components of MSW, including plastic, biomass, and rubber, on the products of pyrolysis are summarized. In addition, the pyrolysis of raw and excavated MSW is discussed. Finally, the prospects and challenges of producing synthetic gas via MSW pyrolysis are outlined.
