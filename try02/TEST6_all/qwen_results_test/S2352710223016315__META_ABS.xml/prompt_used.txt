You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation, characterization, and rheological analysis of eco-friendly geopolymer grouting cementitious materials based on industrial solid wastes Geopolymer grouting materials has been applied in underground engineering as a reinforcement material. At the same time, with the enhancement of human environmental awareness, low carbon environmental grouting materials have attracted widely attention. Therefore, this study used industrial solid wastes circulating fluidized bed fly ash (CFBFA), calcium carbide slag (CS), and flue gas desulfurized gypsum (FGDG) as the main raw materials to prepare eco-friendly geopolymer grouting materials. The compressive strength, setting time, fluidity and stone ratio analysis were systematically evaluated. Finally, the microscopic experiments, including X-Ray Diffraction, CT scanner, TG/DTG analysis, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), were conducted to investigate the mechanism of geopolymer grouting reinforcement materials based on CFBFA, CS and FGDG. The results showed that the solid-wasted grouting materials have a 28d compressive strength of 20.5 MPa, the stone ratio of 99.8%, the fluidity was 250 mm. And adding the 6% alkali activator may enhance the system's fluidity and setting time. In summary, this study analyzed the viability of producing high performance grouting materials for subterranean engineering utilizing industrial solid wastes CFBFA, CS, and FGDG, which are expected to be an alternative for cement as an eco-friendly grouting cementitious material.
