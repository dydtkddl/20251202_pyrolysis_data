You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

ZIF-67-derived Co@NC catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation of 4-ethylphenol to cycloalkanes/cycloalkanols Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived phenolic compounds plays a crucial role in the production of renewable biofuels. In this regard, a series of different Co@NC catalysts were prepared with ZIF-67 as a sacrificial template by modulating the catalyst pyrolysis temperature and used for the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of lignin-derived phenolic model compound 4-ethylphenol for the preparation of cyclohexanols/ cyclohexanes. The results showed that the low-temperature pyrolysis will retain a large number of CoO x compounds, which led to a high dispersion of Co. For Co@NC catalysts, the uniformly dispersed Co component facilitated the adsorption and transfer of hydrogen, and the exposed surface of the carrier promoted the adsorption of reactants. The pyrolysis temperature also played a crucial role in the differences in catalyst crystal surface, specific surface area, acid strength distribution and oxygen vacancies. Co@NC catalyst prepared at 600 °C has a stronger hydrogen absorption capacity, the largest specific surface area and a higher number of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the Co@NC-600 catalyst showed the best HDO activity. Under the mild conditions (220 °C, 2.5 h and 3 MPa H2), the conversion of 4-ethylphenol was close to 100 %, and the selectivities of 4-ethylcyclohexanol and ethylcyclohexane were 62.7 % and 10.8 %, respectively.
