The pyrolysis of rice husks in a thermogravimetric analyser and static batch reactor Rice husks were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser in a nitrogen atmosphere to determine the role of temperature and heating rate on their devolatilization. Heating rates of 5–80 °C min−1 up to a final temperature of 720 °C were used. The thermograms showed two main areas of weight loss and the increase in heating rate caused a lateral shift in the thermograms. The pre-exponential factor and activation energies were calculated for each heating rate. The major components of the rice husks — hemicellulose, lignin and two forms of cellulose — were also analysed by thermogravimetric analysis at the different heating rates and compared with the rice husks. The thermograms from the component parts of the rice husks could be directly correlated with the rice husk devolatilization. Rice husks were also pyrolysed in a static batch reactor at identical conditions to the thermogravimetric analyser to determine the composition of the evolving products during devolatilization. The major volatiles evolved during lower temperature pyrolysis were CO, CO2 and H2O and at higher temperatures lower concentrations of CO, CO2, H2O, H2, CH4. C2H6 and oil were evolved.
