You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The pyrolysis of rice husks in a thermogravimetric analyser and static batch reactor Rice husks were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser in a nitrogen atmosphere to determine the role of temperature and heating rate on their devolatilization. Heating rates of 5–80 °C min−1 up to a final temperature of 720 °C were used. The thermograms showed two main areas of weight loss and the increase in heating rate caused a lateral shift in the thermograms. The pre-exponential factor and activation energies were calculated for each heating rate. The major components of the rice husks — hemicellulose, lignin and two forms of cellulose — were also analysed by thermogravimetric analysis at the different heating rates and compared with the rice husks. The thermograms from the component parts of the rice husks could be directly correlated with the rice husk devolatilization. Rice husks were also pyrolysed in a static batch reactor at identical conditions to the thermogravimetric analyser to determine the composition of the evolving products during devolatilization. The major volatiles evolved during lower temperature pyrolysis were CO, CO2 and H2O and at higher temperatures lower concentrations of CO, CO2, H2O, H2, CH4. C2H6 and oil were evolved.
