Entropy-stabilized homologous catalysts for high performance Li-S batteries: Progress and prospects Lithium-sulfur batteries have garnered widespread attention due to their high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1, low cost, and environmentally friendly characteristics. However, practical applications encounter challenges such as rapid capacity decay and poor cycling stability, primarily due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides during the cycling process. Recent advancements have made significant strides in addressing these challenges by introducing catalysts to promote redox reactions and restrain shuttle effects. An emerging trend worth noting in this regard is the emergence of entropy-stabilized homologous catalysts as innovative approaches for designing advanced catalysts, positioning them as promising candidates for multi-metal catalysts in lithium-sulfur batteries. This review outlines the progress and applications of medium- and high-entropy materials based on the entropy-stabilized concept as catalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries. It covers their properties, advantages, synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and various applications in lithium-sulfur batteries. The review delves into the synergistic effects of various factors on electrochemical performance, as well as strategies for optimizing catalyst design to enhance sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges faced in catalyst design based on entropy-stabilized homologous materials, along with potential future directions and prospects, envisioning the development of high performance lithium-sulfur batteries for future energy storage applications.
