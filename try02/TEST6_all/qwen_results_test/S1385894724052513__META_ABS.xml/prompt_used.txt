You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Entropy-stabilized homologous catalysts for high performance Li-S batteries: Progress and prospects Lithium-sulfur batteries have garnered widespread attention due to their high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg−1, low cost, and environmentally friendly characteristics. However, practical applications encounter challenges such as rapid capacity decay and poor cycling stability, primarily due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides during the cycling process. Recent advancements have made significant strides in addressing these challenges by introducing catalysts to promote redox reactions and restrain shuttle effects. An emerging trend worth noting in this regard is the emergence of entropy-stabilized homologous catalysts as innovative approaches for designing advanced catalysts, positioning them as promising candidates for multi-metal catalysts in lithium-sulfur batteries. This review outlines the progress and applications of medium- and high-entropy materials based on the entropy-stabilized concept as catalysts for lithium-sulfur batteries. It covers their properties, advantages, synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and various applications in lithium-sulfur batteries. The review delves into the synergistic effects of various factors on electrochemical performance, as well as strategies for optimizing catalyst design to enhance sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges faced in catalyst design based on entropy-stabilized homologous materials, along with potential future directions and prospects, envisioning the development of high performance lithium-sulfur batteries for future energy storage applications.
