Addressing the plastic waste crisis: Advanced catalytic strategies for upcycling and fuel production The persistent accumulation of plastic waste poses severe environmental challenges due to its recalcitrance to natural degradation, requiring centuries for complete mineralization. Conventional disposal methods, such as landfilling and incineration, face limitations in sustainability and efficiency, necessitating the development of advanced recycling strategies. Electrocatalysis and photocatalysis have recently emerged as sustainable alternatives, enabling the conversion of plastic waste into value-added chemicals and fuels powered by renewable energy. This review explores recent advances in plastic upcycling through electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic processes, with particular emphasis on catalyst design principles, product selectivity control, and reaction mechanisms. Finally, we propose future directions for plastic waste reforming and transformation.
