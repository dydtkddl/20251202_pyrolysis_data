Highly selective production of light aromatics from co-catalytic fast pyrolysis of pre-deoxygenated biomass and hydrogen-rich polyethylene using a dual-catalyst system Co-catalytic fast pyrolysis of torrefaction deoxygenated pine wood (PW) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in dual-catalyst (metal oxidize and zeolite) system is an effective technology to produce renewable bio-aromatics. In this work, the torrefaction deoxygenation pretreatment (TDP) was carried out to remove oxygen element from PW prior to catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). 56.90 % oxygen could be removed at TDP temperature of 300 °C, releasing in the oxygen carrier of CO2, CO, H2O, alcohols, acids, phenols, etc. Then, the synergistic effect between the metal oxide and the HZSM-5 in dual-catalyst system was also investigated. Among these metal oxides (Al2O3, MgO, CaO, ZnO, and Fe2O3) and hierarchical HZSM-5, the dual-catalyst of CaO and hierarchical HZSM-5 (treated by 0.2 M NaOH) was the optimal combination. The layout mode between feedstock and dual catalyst was also optimized. The highest yield of aromatics was produced in layout Mode 8, where the CaO was mixed with torrefied PW, but the hierarchical HZSM-5 and HDPE were laid in separated layers. The mixing of CaO and torrefied PW promoted the conversion of the macromolecular oxygenates into micromolecular oxygenates. Then, these small-molecular oxygenates could enter the hierarchical channel of HZSM-5, being converted into aromatics by undergoing the Diels-Alder reaction.
