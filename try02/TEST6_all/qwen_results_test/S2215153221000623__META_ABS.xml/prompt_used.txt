You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential nanomaterials-based detection and treatment methods for aqueous chloroform The high carcinogenic risk associated with chloroform (CF) consumption makes the development of on-site detection and removal technologies an important task. The role of nanomaterials (NMs)-based sensors and treatment methods is a promising option owing to their diverse structural and functional merits. In this line, the present review article is designed to highlight the recent development in the applications of NMs for sensing and eliminating aqueous CF. Numerous NMs, including metal oxides, carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and graphitic structures, have been investigated as selective and sensitive (0.003–15.5 mg/L) sensors for CF. Likewise, to remove aqueous CF biochar, zerovalent iron, and silver nanoparticles have been explored as effective adsorbents (4.73−4.69х104mg/g) or reducing agents. Accordingly, selection criteria and performance evaluation of NMs with respect to structural advances (functional groups and polarity) and physiochemical property (hydrophobicity and volatility) of CF is provided. The limitations of the available methods, hindrances in upscaling, recommendations related to the use of non-toxic precursors, simple fabrication techniques, and regeneration possibilities are also discussed. Overall, the review summarizes the available sensing and treatment methods for the effective abatement of aqueous chloroform.
