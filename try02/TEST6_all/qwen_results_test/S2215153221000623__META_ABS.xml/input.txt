Potential nanomaterials-based detection and treatment methods for aqueous chloroform The high carcinogenic risk associated with chloroform (CF) consumption makes the development of on-site detection and removal technologies an important task. The role of nanomaterials (NMs)-based sensors and treatment methods is a promising option owing to their diverse structural and functional merits. In this line, the present review article is designed to highlight the recent development in the applications of NMs for sensing and eliminating aqueous CF. Numerous NMs, including metal oxides, carbon nanotubes, metal-organic frameworks, and graphitic structures, have been investigated as selective and sensitive (0.003–15.5 mg/L) sensors for CF. Likewise, to remove aqueous CF biochar, zerovalent iron, and silver nanoparticles have been explored as effective adsorbents (4.73−4.69х104mg/g) or reducing agents. Accordingly, selection criteria and performance evaluation of NMs with respect to structural advances (functional groups and polarity) and physiochemical property (hydrophobicity and volatility) of CF is provided. The limitations of the available methods, hindrances in upscaling, recommendations related to the use of non-toxic precursors, simple fabrication techniques, and regeneration possibilities are also discussed. Overall, the review summarizes the available sensing and treatment methods for the effective abatement of aqueous chloroform.
