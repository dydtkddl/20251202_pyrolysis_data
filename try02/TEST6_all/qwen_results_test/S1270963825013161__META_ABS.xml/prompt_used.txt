You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and ablation behavior of an innovative thermal ablation/insulation gradient composite coating structure: From numerical model to design optimization Thermal protection coating is the one of ideal materials for large-area ablation regions of spacecraft. A thermal ablation/insulation gradient composite (TAIGC) coating structure is presented, which integrates the advantages of thermal ablation and insulation coatings. In this study, a multi-stage pyrolysis kinetics model was developed to investigate the pyrolysis characteristics based on the thermal analysis kinetics equations. The ablation and thermal protection mechanisms were revealed by analyzing the microstructural evolution of the TAIGC coating structure during thermal exposure tests. Based upon the principles of mass and energy conservation, a coupled ablation and heat transfer model with multi-stage pyrolysis and gas diffusion mechanisms was proposed. Based on the comparison of the temperature–time curves from the simulations and the experimental data, the proposed model could satisfactorily predict the pyrolysis and ablation response of the TAIGC coating structure undergoing ablation. Furthermore, the redesign and optimization of the TAIGC coating structure were conducted using the proposed model. This work can provide a theoretical basis for the high-fidelity design and ablation performance evaluation of multilayer thermal protection coating structures.
