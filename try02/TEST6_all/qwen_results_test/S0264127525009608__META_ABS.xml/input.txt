Radiation spheroidization as a potential method enabling recycling of polyamide 12 waste from powder bed fusion of polymers Thermal aging hinders the use of powder bed fusion (PBF) for large-scale production. Inefficient waste management in PBF requires mixing 30–50 % virgin powder, while only ∼ 10 % becomes finalparts.In this study, a novel method of polymer powder processing is used − radiation spheroidization (RS). In this process, a powder is continuously dispersed in a gas stream, forming an aerosol. This aerosol is subsequently irradiated with an infrared spectrum, causing the particles, which are at near-freefall conditions, to melt, and ultimately results in a change in their shape. Polyamide 12 (PA12) powder was evaluated in three conditions: virgin, thermally aged and spheroidized. Technological properties of spheroidized PA12 reveals spherical or near-spherical shaped particles with enhanced bulk density, flowability and melt viscosity. Moreover, changes in crystalline structure, from α- to γ-phase. With additional thermal processing of aged PA12, progressive thermal aging and degradation of the polymer is observed via gel permeation chromatography. Although additional thermal processing can affect the functional properties of PBF parts, the spheroidization process of PA12 as an RS method itself can be optimized. Therefore, we believe that RS has the potential to become another material-driven method of recycling PBF waste.
