You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process intensification in biodiesel production using unconventional reactors This review discussed unconventional reactors for biodiesel production including static and chaotic mixers, hydrodynamic cavitation reactor, oscillatory flow reactor (OFR), rotating/spinning-tube reactor, reactive distillation, plasma-, spiral-, membrane-, ultrasonic-, microwave-, and microchannel reactors. Mixers and OFR eased biodiesel production with improved mixing, reduced methanol consumption, and faster reaction time. Cavitation and ultrasound reactor intensified oil/catalyst surface area, mass transfer,and transesterification reaction. Rotary/spinning tube reactors enabled shear stress on oil/alcohol films, providing a high surface area/volume ratio and high interactions between the reactants. Plasma reactor avoided catalyst use and enabled biodiesel production 20 – 25 folds faster than the conventional reactor. Reactive distillation with membrane reactors avoided the separation issue. Spiral reactor facilitated enhanced heat transfer between the reacting mixtures with net energy ratio and energy efficiency of 0.92 and 0.98, respectively. Microwave reactors enabled local heating of reactants and resulted in uniform heating of the reaction mixture. Microreactors enabled short diffusion distance, improved surface area/volume ratio, and enhanced heat and mass transfers than conventional reactors. Thus, the unconventional reactors appeared promising to intensify biodiesel production, however, significant efforts are needed to reach their applications in commercial biodiesel production.
