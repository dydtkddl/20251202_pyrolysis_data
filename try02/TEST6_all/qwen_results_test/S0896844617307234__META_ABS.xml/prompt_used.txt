You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pressurized fluid treatment of barley and canola straws to obtain carbohydrates and phenolics Canada produces annually vast amounts of barley and canola straws. In this study, barley and canola straws were hydrolyzed using subcritical water (sCW) and pressurized aqueous ethanol (PAE) at 140–220 °C, 50–200 bar and 20–100% (v/v) ethanol concentrations for maximum removal of carbohydrates and phenolics. Total carbohydrates, phenolics, antioxidant activity and brown color formation were quantified via UV-spectrophotometer. Temperature and ethanol concentration were important process parameters for the removal of biocompounds from barley and canola straws. Optimum process conditions for removal of phenolics (45.4 ± 1.8 mg GAE/g barley straw and 52.9 ± 2.0 mg GAE/g canola straw) and carbohydrates (527.6 ± 0.5 mg GE/g barley straw and 442.7 ± 14.8 mg GE/g canola straw) were 180 °C, 50 bar and 20% ethanol. Furthermore, 54 and 45% of total lignin were removed using PAE (20%) from barley and canola straws, respectively. The FT-IR, TG, DTG and SEM analysis confirmed the removal of non-cellulosic materials.
