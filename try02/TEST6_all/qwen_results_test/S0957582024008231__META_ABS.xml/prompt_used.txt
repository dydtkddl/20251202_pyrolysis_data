You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis behavior of municipal solid waste and food waste residue: A thermogravimetric study to discern synergistic effect Effective solid waste disposal necessitates suitable combination and clean conversion technologies to maximize resource utilization. Thus, this study investigates the behavior of co-pyrolysis in municipal solid waste (MSW) and food waste (FW) via thermogravimetric analysis, aiming to discern synergistic effects and optimize waste to energy conversion. The impacts of heating rate and blending ratios were evaluated under an inert N2 atmosphere, within a temperature range of 30–900℃, during single and combined pyrolysis processes respectively. Results revealed slight variations in weight loss patterns and thermal decomposition behavior. When heating rate increased from 10 to 30℃.min−1, decomposition process delayed, resulting in higher initial (T i ), peak (T P ), and final (T f ) temperatures due to inadequate heat transfer. As food waste increased, mass loss rose and favorable synergistic effect was observed at 20 % FW during medium temperatures, while other blends showed inhibitory effects. The pyrolytic index (D) rose nonlinearly from 6.29 × 10−7 to 7.72 × 10−7 with a higher FW proportion, peaking at 20 % FW, suggesting an optimal MSW and FW mixing ratio. This blend also exhibited the lowest activation energy, indicating a more efficient thermal decomposition process. Those outcomes offer crucial insights for optimizing co-pyrolysis systems and provide essential information for co-disposal of MSW and FW, potentially reducing pollutant emissions and enhancing waste to energy conversion.
