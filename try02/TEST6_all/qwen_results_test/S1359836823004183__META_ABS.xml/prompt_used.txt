You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Filament fabrication and subsequent additive manufacturing, debinding, and sintering for extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing and their applications: A review Additive manufacturing (AM) is suitable for fabricating components made from expensive, high-strength metallic materials, which can be designed and created with minimal material waste during the layer-upon-layer addition process. The development of new products has already made great use of AM technology for prototyping. Today, components created by AM are used directly in the finished product, and in some instances, AM components are used as spare parts across numerous industries. However, the cost of currently available metal additive manufacturing (AM) machines for metals based on selective laser melting and the cost of part manufacture is very high. Furthermore, the processes used by these technologies produce waste metal powder, creating an adverse effect on the environment. As a result, there is an increasing demand for new techniques with environmental friendliness, high mass production rates, and low production costs. In light of this, extrusion-based metal AM techniques, which utilize the fused filament fabrication (FFF) approach, are a great alternative to the current laser-based metal AM solutions. The extrusion-based metal printing technique uses customized filaments with metal particles distributed in a sacrificial polymeric binder. A FFF printer is utilized to 3D print the green part. The polymeric binder is removed from the printed parts using a catalytic solvent or debinder (depending on the step). The final metallic parts are obtained after the sintering stage. This article thoroughly discusses all aspects of filament fabrication, AM of green parts, debinding, sintering, and post-processing of green and sintered parts in extrusion-based metal AM.
