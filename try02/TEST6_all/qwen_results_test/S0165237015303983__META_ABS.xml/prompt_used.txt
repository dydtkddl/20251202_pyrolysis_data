You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal cracking of n-butylcyclohexane at high pressure (100bar)—Part 2: Mechanistic modeling A detailed kinetic model consisting of 833 reactions has been developed to describe the thermal cracking of n-butylcyclohexane at high pressure (100bar). A primary mechanism was written in an exhaustive manner whereas a partial secondary mechanism was considered to describe the formation and the consumption reactions of aromatic compounds. The model was tested against our experimental data for BCH pyrolysis at 100bar in the temperature range 375–425°C. A global agreement was reached for BCH conversion up to 50% for both conversion and product yields e.g. propane, cyclohexane and toluene. Flow analysis of the proposed mechanism at a conversion of 35% shows that both alkanes (i.e. methane, ethane, propane and n-butane) and cycloalkanes (i.e. cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and ethylcyclohexane) mainly come from the breaking of the side alkyl chain. The production of butylbenzene is due to the direct dehydrogenation of BCH whereas other alkylaromatic compounds i.e. benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene seem to come from the breaking of the side alkyl chain of butylbenzene rather than aromatization of cycloalkanes or alkylcyclohexenes. At 100bar and around 400°C, breaking of alkyl side chain reactions prevail on dehydrogenation reactions and ring opening.
