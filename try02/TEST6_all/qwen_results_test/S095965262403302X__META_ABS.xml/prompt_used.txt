You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress and development of biochar as a catalyst for hydrogen production The recent progress of the biochar application as a catalyst for the production of hydrogen has been presented in this review. Biochar is a carbon-rich material, which can be produced through different thermochemical conversions (pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal carbonization) using various feedstocks. Biochar has gained attention as a possible catalyst for the production of hydrogen in recent years. It has a distinctive structure and multiple functions and can be accessed widely. The utilization of biochar as a catalyst can significantly improve the hydrogen yield and quality, showing improved catalytic activity and thermal stability. The physiochemical characteristics of biochar are also affected by the different types of feedstocks. Furthermore, the biochar performance can be increased as a catalyst when it is modified with alkali, acid, metal ions, carbonaceous materials, oxidants, purging of gas, and steam. This review presents an overview of the feedstock, production, modification, and characterization methods of the biochar, followed by an elaborate discussion on the application of biochar as a catalyst. This paper addresses the current development of biochar as a catalyst/support for hydrogen production in thermochemical techniques, photocatalytic water splitting, dark fermentation, and methane steam reforming. Overall, biochar catalyst has the potential for a cleaner and more effective energy system.
