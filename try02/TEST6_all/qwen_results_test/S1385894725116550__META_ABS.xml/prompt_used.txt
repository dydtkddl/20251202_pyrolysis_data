You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Purpose-driven polymers: Mechanistic insights and empirical advances in inverse vulcanized polysulfides for mercury remediation Inverse vulcanized polysulfides (IV PS) are an emerging class of sulfur-rich polymers that have garnered increasing attention as promising adsorbents for mercury (Hg) remediation. Their chemical tunability, abundance of soft Lewis base sulfur moieties, and alignment with green chemistry principles position them as potentially sustainable and cost-effective solutions for addressing Hg, one of the most toxic and persistent pollutants. This promise is further reinforced by their green credentials: IV PS are synthesized from elemental sulfur, an abundant industrial by-product, often in combination with renewable monomers, enabling sustainable, high-capacity sorbents with low production cost. Yet, a critical question remains: have IV PS truly delivered on their potential as ideal Hg adsorbents? This review explores the purpose-driven development of IV PS-based Hg adsorbents, spanning foundational synthesis strategies to emerging computational approaches. Key motivations discussed include: (1) comonomer selection; (2) enhancement of adsorbent properties (e.g., surface area, wettability, reactivity, and topology); (3) advances in inverse vulcanization strategies (e.g., catalyst-free multicomponent polymerization/nucleophilic activation and catalysis); (4) performance evaluation; and (5) integration of computational tools. Addressing whether IV PS have reached their potential, this review critically examines performance metrics (i.e., adsorption isotherms, kinetics, selectivity, and cost-effectiveness) underscoring the need for standardized performance testing reporting and introduces the concept of percent binding site utilization to better leverage their high sulfur content. By identifying critical gaps in design development and performance evaluation of IV PS, this review provides a foundation for advancing IV PS from promising laboratory materials to practical, scalable solutions for Hg remediation.
