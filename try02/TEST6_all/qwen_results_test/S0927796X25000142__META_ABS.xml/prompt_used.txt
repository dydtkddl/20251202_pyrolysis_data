You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hetero-layered 2D materials: Scalable preparation and energy applications To be considered for use in practical energy storage and conversion applications, two-dimensional (2D) materials require a well-defined size distribution, large specific surface area, lightweight, and controllable crystallinity. In line with this, hetero-layered 2D (2D-HL) materials, comprising stacked layers with tailored compositions and structures, offer unique properties ideal for energy-related applications. However, the large-scale synthesis of uniformly sized 2D-HL materials with consistent characteristics remains a significant challenge. To address this, both top-down and bottom-up synthesis methods have been investigated, particularly with top-down exfoliation emerging as a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable technique. This review examines recent advancements in the synthesis of 2D-HL materials via various exfoliation processes, emphasizing the correlation between material structure and the selected exfoliation approach while evaluating the scalability of these methods. Understanding the principles that govern the synthesis and optimization of scalable 2D-HL materials is essential for overcoming current challenges and leveraging future opportunities in advanced energy storage applications. Furthermore, this review provides an in-depth analysis of the potential of physical exfoliation methods to produce 2D-HL materials with the properties necessary for energy storage and conversion applications.
