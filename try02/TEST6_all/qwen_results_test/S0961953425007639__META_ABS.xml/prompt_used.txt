You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Rethinking energy delivery in biomass pyrolysis: Comparative insights into conventional, microwave, and induction heating Driven by the demands of global energy transition and carbon emission reduction, pyrolysis technology has become a research hotspot due to its ability to efficiently convert biomass into high-value energy and chemicals. However, conventional heating technologies are limited by low heat transfer efficiency, high energy loss, and poor product selectivity. Promising strategies include integrating advanced heating techniques and selecting appropriate catalysts. This review first introduces the heating mechanisms of conventional heating, microwave heating, and electromagnetic induction heating. Subsequently, the characteristics of the three heating reactors are compared, and their heat transfer mechanisms are further elucidated. The impact of each heating method on product distribution and yield is further discussed, highlighting their respective advantages in biomass pyrolysis. In addition, the role of catalysts, especially under microwave and electromagnetic induction heating, is systematically evaluated. In this review, microwave heating (0.3–300 GHz) and electromagnetic induction heating (10 kHz-10 MHz) utilize electromagnetic waves to directly heat hotspots within feedstocks. Moreover, electromagnetic induction heating can reduce energy consumption by more than 40 %, and the phenols obtained from induction heating of lignin can reach up to 100 %. This review aims to provide new insights into energy-efficient heating strategies and catalysis-assisted pyrolysis, offering guidance for the development of next-generation biomass pyrolysis technologies.
