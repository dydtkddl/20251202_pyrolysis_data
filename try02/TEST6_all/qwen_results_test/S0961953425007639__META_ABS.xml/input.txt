Rethinking energy delivery in biomass pyrolysis: Comparative insights into conventional, microwave, and induction heating Driven by the demands of global energy transition and carbon emission reduction, pyrolysis technology has become a research hotspot due to its ability to efficiently convert biomass into high-value energy and chemicals. However, conventional heating technologies are limited by low heat transfer efficiency, high energy loss, and poor product selectivity. Promising strategies include integrating advanced heating techniques and selecting appropriate catalysts. This review first introduces the heating mechanisms of conventional heating, microwave heating, and electromagnetic induction heating. Subsequently, the characteristics of the three heating reactors are compared, and their heat transfer mechanisms are further elucidated. The impact of each heating method on product distribution and yield is further discussed, highlighting their respective advantages in biomass pyrolysis. In addition, the role of catalysts, especially under microwave and electromagnetic induction heating, is systematically evaluated. In this review, microwave heating (0.3–300 GHz) and electromagnetic induction heating (10 kHz-10 MHz) utilize electromagnetic waves to directly heat hotspots within feedstocks. Moreover, electromagnetic induction heating can reduce energy consumption by more than 40 %, and the phenols obtained from induction heating of lignin can reach up to 100 %. This review aims to provide new insights into energy-efficient heating strategies and catalysis-assisted pyrolysis, offering guidance for the development of next-generation biomass pyrolysis technologies.
