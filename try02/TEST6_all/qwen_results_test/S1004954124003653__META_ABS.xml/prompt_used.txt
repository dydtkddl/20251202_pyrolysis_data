You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of sodium zeolite mixed metal oxide catalysts on catalytic conversion of mixed-density plastic into carbon nanotubes and hydrogen fuel A combination of experimental and statistical analysis presents a comprehensive understanding of the microwave pyrolysis technique for catalytic deconstruction of mixed-density plastics. By optimizing the process parameters and catalyst selection, it is possible to maximize the production of valuable solid and energy products, contributing to sustainable waste management. In this work, different mixed-density plastics were pyrolyzed with different catalysts and residence times to yield liquid fuel, syngas, and structured carbon residue. The effect of inputs on the product type, yield and composition was statistically evaluated using ANOVA, which showed an F value of 4.108 and a p-value of 0.098 (>1.00). FTIR and GC-MS revealed that the oil product consisted of C13+ fractions in the form of alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics. The microscopic analysis of the residue confirmed the formation of carbon nanotubes along with other amorphous products. The presence of impurities in the solid product was further analyzed through XRD analysis. The pyrolytic liquid fuel revealed the presence of conjugated aromatic structure and carbonyl group in their concentration. This research demonstrated that converting mixed-density plastics using sodium zeolite, aluminum oxide, and nickel oxide catalysts yields 84% valuable products, confirming wasted plastics as a lucrative energy feedstock for producing hydrogen and high-value carbon compounds.
