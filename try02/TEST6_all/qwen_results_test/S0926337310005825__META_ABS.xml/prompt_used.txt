You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Consequences of the iron–aluminium exchange on the performance of hydrotalcite-derived mixed oxides for ethanol condensation The effect of the partial and total substitution of aluminium by iron on the performance of different hydrotalcite-derived mixed oxides for the condensation of ethanol for obtaining valuable C4 products (mainly butanol and 1,3,-butadiene) has been studied in this work. Ethanol condensation reactions have been performed in a fixed bed reactor at 0.1MPa, WHSV=0.215h−1 and 473–723K. Three different hydrotalcite-derived mixed oxide with an atomic Mg2+/M3+ ratio of 3 (namely Mg6Al2O9, Mg6AlFeO9 and Mg6Fe2O9) have been prepared by a previously optimized procedure, tested as catalyst for the above mentioned reaction and characterized by TG–DTG, NH3-TPD, CO2 adsorption (calorimetric, TG–DTG and FTIR), Mossbauer Spectroscopy and TPR. The substitution of Al3+ by Fe3+ in the structure of the resulting mixed oxide leads to a slight decrease of the basic sites and a more marked decrease of the concentration of acid sites, being the concentration of these last sites negligible when the Al3+ cation is completely replaced by Fe3+. Accordingly, Mg–Fe mixed oxide is the most selective catalyst for the formation of C4 compounds, especially butanol. The almost total abatement of the acid sites of this material largely decrease the selectivity for ethanol dehydration, resulting in an increase of the formation of the dehydrogenation product (acetaldehyde), key reactant for condensation reactions.
