You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of thermochemical routes for the valorization of solid coffee residues to produce biofuels: A Brazilian case Coffee production in Brazil creates significant amounts of residues. The goals of this study are to evaluate the characteristics of these residues (parchment, husk, pulp, spent grounds, silverskin and defective beans); to discuss their potential for conversion to improved biofuels via thermochemical methods; and to develop mass and energy balances of the processes to help determine the value of residues for direct combustion, fast and slow pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal carbonization and torrefaction. Particularly the pulp, but also husk and parchment, are characterized by high moisture, as well as high contents of cellulose (41–64%) and hemicellulose (27–35%). These residues are suitable for several conversion routes, albeit with the drawback of drying need for the dry methods. The ash of these also creates a risk of fouling, corrosion and agglomeration with high-temperature and fluidized bed technologies. The silverskin and some of the defective beans are available at lower moisture. The spent coffee grounds appear a particularly advantageous residue for energy use: while moisture varies, the roasted product dries easily and has the highest heating value of the residues. For defective beans, little thermochemical treatment data is available. Among the technologies, for wet feedstocks hydrothermal carbonization has the advantage of post-conversion drying. Gasification appears advantageous for parchment with a high syngas yield and heating value. Fast pyrolysis of biomass suffers from the oxygen content of the liquid, requiring additional treatment; slow pyrolysis may be more appropriate. In conclusion, coffee residues have potential as feedstocks for a number of thermochemical conversion processes.
