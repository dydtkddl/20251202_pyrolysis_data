You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High carbon-resistant nickel supported on yttria–zirconia catalysts for syngas production by dry reforming of methane: The promoting effect of cesium Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a highly researched process for conversion of methane into syngas that consumes the greenhouse gas (CO2). In this work, the promotional effect of cesium on yttria-zirconia-supported nickel catalysts is studied, for the first time, in DRM. Cs loading was varied from 0.5 to 4.0 wt% and fresh materials were characterized by N2 sorption, XRD, TPR, and TEM, while spent catalysts were examined by TEM, Raman spectroscopy, and TGA after catalytic testing. Interestingly, cesium improved carbon resistance of the catalysts. It was shown that addition of up to 1.0 wt% Cs resulted in formation of 13–14 nm nanoparticles in strong interaction with the support, which prevented their sintering during reaction. In this case, hydrogen yield exceeded 75% after 420 min on stream, and this value was higher than those reported in literature for the same loading of other promoters like cerium and barium. However, as the amount of cesium surpassed 1.0 wt%, catalytic performance was lowered, even below that of Cs-free sample and this can be assigned to a possible coverage of active sites by excess cesium. An optimum range of 0.5–1.0 wt% was thus determined for a good performance in dry reforming of methane.
