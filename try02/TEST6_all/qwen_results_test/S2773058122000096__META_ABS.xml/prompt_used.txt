You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastic wastes derived carbon materials for green energy and sustainable environmental applications Plastic waste has become a serious environmental issue and has attracted increasing attention. Various treatment technologies have been developed for the remediation of this waste, including degradation, recycling and upcycling, and transformation to value-added products has been extensively studied. Transitioning plastic waste into carbon-based functional materials is especially attractive because of the practical applications of plastic wastes derived carbon materials (PWCMs) in the field of green energy and in sustainable environmental practices. Herein, recent advances in the preparation and applications of PWCMs are systematically reviewed. Thermal treatment methods for synthesizing carbon-based materials from plastic waste are summarized, including anoxic pyrolysis, catalytic and pressure carbonization techniques, flash Joule heating and microwave conversion. The applications of PWCMs and PWCMs-based composites to green energy storage and production (such as in batteries, supercapacitors and water-splitting systems) and sustainable environmental concepts (pollutant adsorption/degradation, solar evaporation and CO2 capture) are detailed, with an emphasis on the property-performance correlation. The potential for future development of PWCMs is also examined. This review is meant to provide insights into the advanced applications of PWCMs and to stimulate the future upcycling of plastic waste.
