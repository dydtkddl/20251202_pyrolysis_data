You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A new configuration in the tail-end acetylene hydrogenation reactor to enhance catalyst lifetime and performance Due to importance of acetylene removal from ethylene rich stream in polymerization units in order to prevent formation of highly explosive compounds, presenting any strategies improving the process efficiency has attracted researchers and industries interests. Proposing novel configurations in the reaction-regeneration cycles with lower energy consumption and enhanced catalyst lifetime leading to profits for the polymerization units is of a great interest. In this regard, a new configuration for the tail-end acetylene hydrogenation reactor of a commercial olefin plant was proposed in the present study. Based on the proposed configuration, a new protocol is applied to the process for utilizing total capacity of active catalysts in each fixed bed. A mathematical model based on component and energy balance was developed and validated to evaluate the operability of the proposed configuration. Operation of different runs in the new protocol was compared with the conventional configuration. The obtained results revealed that the new configuration is managed to decrease the volume of the regenerated catalyst in a 4-year period of operation. A 33.3% decrease in the volume of the regenerated catalyst was observed. Such an achievement was obtained without reducing acetylene conversion and ethylene yield.
