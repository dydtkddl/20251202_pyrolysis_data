You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable construction strategies to achieve synergy through MOF-COF composite materials In recent years, extensive research on porous organic materials has been conducted, leading to significant advancements in the field. Notably, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials with diverse applications. These materials possess unique structures that allow for precise manipulation and engineering at the molecular level, resulting in predetermined compositions, structures, functionalities, and properties. MOFs and COFs have demonstrated immense potential in a wide range of fields, including gas storage, energy conversion, drug delivery, heterogeneous catalysis, biomedicine, and biosensing. By combining distinct types of porous materials into composites, it becomes possible to create materials with enhanced porosity, synergistic properties, improved stability, and novel shapes. The composite materials benefit from the superior attributes of their constituent MOFs and COFs. There is a burgeoning interest in the fabrication and application of MOF-COF composites, which present numerous benefits beyond their separate elements, including improved properties, customizable features, increased stability, multifunctionality, and the possibility for innovative functionalities. Continual efforts in research and development within this domain promise to further elucidate their capabilities, paving the way for groundbreaking progress in the field of materials science and engineering. Given the considerable interest surrounding hybrid MOF-COP composites, conducting a comprehensive examination of this topic is both relevant and timely. This review specifically focuses on the most recent strategies utilized to unlock the synergistic potential of MOF-COF composite materials across various applications. These applications include photocatalysts, heterogeneous catalysts, sensors and detectors, membranes, and absorbents. The objective of this review is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the construction methods employed to unlock the potential of MOF-COF composites and evaluate their performance across various fields. Furthermore, this paper consolidates existing knowledge, identifies emerging trends and areas of research, and serves as a valuable reference for future investigations in this domain.
