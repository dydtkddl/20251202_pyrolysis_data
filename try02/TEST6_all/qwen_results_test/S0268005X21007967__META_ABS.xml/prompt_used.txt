You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-pressure plasma modification of the rheological properties of tapioca starch Starch is an important biopolymer widely used in the pharmaceutical, food and textile industries. In this study, low-pressure (0.5 atm) cold plasma was used as an novel technique to modify the rheological behaviours of native tapioca starch using four different feeding gases (air, carbon dioxide, argon, and helium). The induced changes in starch samples were studied by rapid visco analyser (RVA), Rheometer, Fourier transform mid-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, respectively. The plasma significantly (P < 0.05) increased peak viscosity, trough viscosity and breakdown viscosity of the treated starch compared to the control. FTIR spectral absorption peaks of the different plasma treated samples were observed at 924, 994, 1149, 1335 and 3274 cm−1, which are related to C–O–C asymmetric stretching, C–OH bending, C–O–C asymmetric stretching, C–H bending and O–H stretching bonds, respectively. The differences in absorbance intensity at these frequencies revealed chemical changes in the corresponding functional groups. The results of FTIR spectral data support the theory that cross-linking reactions occur between starch molecules during plasma treatment, resulting in changes of pasting and rheological properties. However, there was no obvious fissures or cavities observed on the surface of starch granules observed using SEM imaging.
