Assessment of supercritical water gasification of food waste under the background of waste sorting: Influences of plastic waste contents Waste sorting is being gradually implemented as a key measure for circular and sustainable development in China, food waste will be separately collected and separated from municipal solid waste (MSW), thus the plastic content in food waste also will be reduced. In this study, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of food waste with different contents of plastic (0–3.5 wt%) was experimentally investigated to simulate the influence of waste sorting on the food waste treatment. The results showed that lower plastic content in food waste favored higher gas yield and gasification efficiencies. The highest H2 yield and total gas yield were 3.11 mol/kg and 8.41 mol/kg in the plastic-free case, respectively. When the plastic content decreased from 3.5 wt% to 0 wt%, the cold gas efficiency (CGE), carbon conversion efficiency (CE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HE) increased by 125.97%, 173.48% and 94.09%, respectively. However, lower plastic content negatively affected the quality of produced syngas through decreasing H2 mole fraction and LHV. The solid residues from SCWG of food waste with lower plastic content had higher ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matter (FC/VM). Based on the analysis of pyrolysis properties and combustion behavior, decreasing the plastic content in food waste helped to improve the thermal stability of solid residues. Moreover, lower plastic content resulted in a decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in liquid effluent, which is favorable for further treatment of liquid effluent.
