You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of supercritical water gasification of food waste under the background of waste sorting: Influences of plastic waste contents Waste sorting is being gradually implemented as a key measure for circular and sustainable development in China, food waste will be separately collected and separated from municipal solid waste (MSW), thus the plastic content in food waste also will be reduced. In this study, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of food waste with different contents of plastic (0–3.5 wt%) was experimentally investigated to simulate the influence of waste sorting on the food waste treatment. The results showed that lower plastic content in food waste favored higher gas yield and gasification efficiencies. The highest H2 yield and total gas yield were 3.11 mol/kg and 8.41 mol/kg in the plastic-free case, respectively. When the plastic content decreased from 3.5 wt% to 0 wt%, the cold gas efficiency (CGE), carbon conversion efficiency (CE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HE) increased by 125.97%, 173.48% and 94.09%, respectively. However, lower plastic content negatively affected the quality of produced syngas through decreasing H2 mole fraction and LHV. The solid residues from SCWG of food waste with lower plastic content had higher ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matter (FC/VM). Based on the analysis of pyrolysis properties and combustion behavior, decreasing the plastic content in food waste helped to improve the thermal stability of solid residues. Moreover, lower plastic content resulted in a decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in liquid effluent, which is favorable for further treatment of liquid effluent.
