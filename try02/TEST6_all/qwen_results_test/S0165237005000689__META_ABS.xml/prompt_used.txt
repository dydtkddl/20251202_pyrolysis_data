You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics of scrap tyre pyrolysis under fast heating conditions The kinetics of scrap tyre pyrolysis has been studied by means of thermogravimetry (runs at constant temperature and following temperature ramps) and using a fast heating microreactor. The advantages of the microreactor for obtaining kinetic data at higher temperatures (in the 773–973K range) than those corresponding to thermogravimetry and under conditions similar to those of continuous large-scale reactor are clearly shown. The validity of the kinetic parameters determined (E =98.6kJmol−1 and k 0 =7.35×104 s−1) will only be restricted by unavoidable heat and mass transfer limitations, which have been minimized by using a particle size smaller than 0.2mm. The kinetic results are evidence, on the one hand, of the limitations of these laboratory techniques for the kinetic study and, on the other, of the inherent heat and mass limitations of this material. Through monitoring by gas chromatography, the kinetics of formation of hydrocarbon products has been determined. These products are interesting as raw materials for petrochemistrical industry (mainly light olefins and aromatics) and for the synthesis of basic materials in tyre manufacturing (isoprene and 1,3-butadiene).
