You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Classification of biomass through their pyrolytic bio-oil composition using FTIR and PCA analysis Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, combined to principal components analysis (PCA), was applied in the classification of biomasses through the composition of their bio-oil. Bio-oils were produced through pyrolysis in a bed fixed reactor, using fifteen biomass sources available in Brazil and its characterization was made using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detector (GC/qMS). Around two hundred compounds were tentatively identified in the fifteen bio-oil samples. As expected, the chemical compositions in each bio-oil were distinct. Through the chromatographic information and PCA of the FTIR spectra it was possible observed the similarity and dissimilarity of biomasses according their bio-oil compositions. PCA revealed that FTIR spectra of biomasses fell into three different groups representing distinct bio-oil chemical compositions. The biomasses that belong to group 1 showed bio-oil compositions rich in carboxylic acids, the group 2 showed bio-oil compositions consisting predominantly of phenols and group 3 showed bio-oils with a significant amount of nitrogen compounds. Such clustering information allow exploring bio-oil quality prior to pyrolysis process.
