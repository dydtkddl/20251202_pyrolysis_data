Fixed-bed CO2 adsorption onto activated char from the pyrolysis of a non-recyclable plastic mixture from real urban residues The potential use of activated char obtained from the pyrolysis of a mixture of non-recyclable plastics for the adsorption of CO2 in fixed-bed columns has been explored. The rejected fraction of plastics collected in a municipal solid treatment plant was pyrolyzed and the resulting char residue was activated to develop a porous carbonaceous material. The dynamic behavior of CO2 adsorption was assessed by the breakthrough curves obtained in continuous column tests. Among all the available models, the curves were successfully fitted to the dose-response model. The effect of adsorption temperature (15–45 ºC), the inlet CO2 concentration (10–40 %, vol.), and the adsorbent length of the bed (loadings, 1–2 g) on the efficiency of the process was evaluated by the surface response methodology applying an adaptative neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). A temperature rise exerted a negative effect on the adsorption capacity due to the physisorption properties of the process, the fed CO2 concentration displayed a positive effect and the fixed-bed length did not play a remarkable influence.
