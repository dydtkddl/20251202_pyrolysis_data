You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fixed-bed CO2 adsorption onto activated char from the pyrolysis of a non-recyclable plastic mixture from real urban residues The potential use of activated char obtained from the pyrolysis of a mixture of non-recyclable plastics for the adsorption of CO2 in fixed-bed columns has been explored. The rejected fraction of plastics collected in a municipal solid treatment plant was pyrolyzed and the resulting char residue was activated to develop a porous carbonaceous material. The dynamic behavior of CO2 adsorption was assessed by the breakthrough curves obtained in continuous column tests. Among all the available models, the curves were successfully fitted to the dose-response model. The effect of adsorption temperature (15–45 ºC), the inlet CO2 concentration (10–40 %, vol.), and the adsorbent length of the bed (loadings, 1–2 g) on the efficiency of the process was evaluated by the surface response methodology applying an adaptative neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). A temperature rise exerted a negative effect on the adsorption capacity due to the physisorption properties of the process, the fed CO2 concentration displayed a positive effect and the fixed-bed length did not play a remarkable influence.
