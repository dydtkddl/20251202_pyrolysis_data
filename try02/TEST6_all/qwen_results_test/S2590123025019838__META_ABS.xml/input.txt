Heterogeneous alkaline calcium oxide nano-catalyst supported on porous materials for the transesterification reaction: A review In the present review work, the use of calcium oxide as alkaline solid catalyst for the production of biodiesel using transesterification reaction was investigated. Calcium oxide catalyst were developed from various calcium rich biomass resources. The catalytic activity, reusability, stability and performance of calcium oxide as a catalyst were enhanced through the synthesis of calcium oxide at nano-scale and supporting on porous materials. This work critically review CaO heterogeneous catalysts synthesized from various biomass rich wastes with respect to the emerging nanotechnologies. The review work presents the gaps identified in the literature for CaO based heterogeneous catalysts derived from various biomass wastes, different synthesis methods of nanocatalysts and its development towards supported nanocatalysts. The prospects of the emerging nanotechnologies for enhancement of the catalysts alkalinity strength, catalytic activity, stability, selectivity and reduce catalyst leachability while increasing durability were also discussed. This review work, therefore, provides a critical insight on existing scientific data and the development of CaO-based supported nanocatalysts for the biodiesel production.
