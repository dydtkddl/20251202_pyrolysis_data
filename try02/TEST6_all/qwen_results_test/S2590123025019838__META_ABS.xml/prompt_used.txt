You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Heterogeneous alkaline calcium oxide nano-catalyst supported on porous materials for the transesterification reaction: A review In the present review work, the use of calcium oxide as alkaline solid catalyst for the production of biodiesel using transesterification reaction was investigated. Calcium oxide catalyst were developed from various calcium rich biomass resources. The catalytic activity, reusability, stability and performance of calcium oxide as a catalyst were enhanced through the synthesis of calcium oxide at nano-scale and supporting on porous materials. This work critically review CaO heterogeneous catalysts synthesized from various biomass rich wastes with respect to the emerging nanotechnologies. The review work presents the gaps identified in the literature for CaO based heterogeneous catalysts derived from various biomass wastes, different synthesis methods of nanocatalysts and its development towards supported nanocatalysts. The prospects of the emerging nanotechnologies for enhancement of the catalysts alkalinity strength, catalytic activity, stability, selectivity and reduce catalyst leachability while increasing durability were also discussed. This review work, therefore, provides a critical insight on existing scientific data and the development of CaO-based supported nanocatalysts for the biodiesel production.
