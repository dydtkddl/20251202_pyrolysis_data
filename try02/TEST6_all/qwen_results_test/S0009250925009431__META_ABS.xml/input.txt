Microfluidic technology for cleaner production in microchemical engineering: design, fabrication and application panorama With the acceleration of the global industrialization process, the traditional production mode is facing the huge challenge of resource consumption and environmental pollution. As a sustainable strategy, cleaner production aims to achieve green manufacturing through the efficient use of resources and the minimization of pollution emissions. Microfluidic technology, with its excellent mass and heat transfer performance, high safety, environmental protection and accurate reaction control ability, has become a transformative force to promote cleaner production in the field of microchemical engineering. In this paper, the innovative application of microfluidic technology in clean production is comprehensively reviewed, and the collaborative implementation path with the principle of green chemistry is deeply analyzed. The design and manufacturing process of microfluidic devices and their application in key fields such as green chemical process intensification, wastewater treatment and resource recovery, and energy efficient conversion are systematically evaluated. In addition, this paper further discusses the challenges faced by microfluidic technology in industrial scale deployment, and proposes methods to deal with these challenges by using artificial intelligence optimization, modular design and other strategies.
