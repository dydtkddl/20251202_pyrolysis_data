You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical-looping combustion of solid fuels – Operation in a 10kW unit with two fuels, above-bed and in-bed fuel feed and two oxygen carriers, manganese ore and ilmenite Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a combustion concept with inherent separation of CO2. The process uses a solid oxygen carrier, which consists of metal oxide, to transfer the oxygen from air to fuel. The chemical-looping combustor used in the present experiments features two interconnected fluidized beds; a fuel reactor (FR) and an air reactor (AR). In the FR, fuel is gasified with steam whereupon gasification products react with the oxygen carrier to form, ideally, CO2 and H2O. This study concerns CLC of solid fuels in a continuously operating 10kW unit using two natural ores as oxygen carrier: (a) ilmenite, an iron–titanium mineral and (b) a manganese ore containing smaller amounts of Fe, Al and Si. The fuel feed was re-designed in order to increase contact between oxygen carrier and fuel. The new in-bed fuel feed was found to significantly improve gas conversion, mainly caused by increased contact between the oxygen carrier and volatile gases released in the fuel chute. Two fuels were used to evaluate the effect of fuel feed; a bituminous coal and a pet coke. The in-bed fuel feed was used when ilmenite and manganese ore were compared. The use of a manganese ore as oxygen carrier was shown to significantly enhance the rate of char gasification and also improve gas conversion. A concern with the manganese ore is the large production of fines.
