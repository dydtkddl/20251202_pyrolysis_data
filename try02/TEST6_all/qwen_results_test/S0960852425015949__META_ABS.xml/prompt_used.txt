You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of bioplastics into poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) via thermochemical depolymerisation and fermentation: A model for post-consumer waste recycling This study investigates the thermochemical depolymerisation of commercial bioplastics – including pure poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) powder (PHBP), PHB-based compounded pellets (PHBCP) and polylactic acid (PLA) – followed by bioconversion of the resulting monomers into PHB by Paraburkholderia sacchari and Cupriavidus necator. Hydrothermal hydrolysates of PHBP and PHBCP at 200 °C and 5–6 h treatment resulted in 72.9–74.0 % 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3HB) and 21.9–27.1 % crotonic acid (CA) content, whereas PLA fully degraded into lactic acid at 140 °C. Alkaline treatment of PHBP and PHBCP resulted in higher CA:3HB ratio (0.52–0.65) than hydrothermal treatment (0.3–0.37). Shake-flask fermentations using PHBP (2.2 gPHB/L by P. sacchari) or PLA (3.5 gPHB/L by C. necator) hydrothermal hydrolysates showed higher polymer production than PHBCP hydrothermal and PHBP alkaline hydrolysates. Hydrothermal co-hydrolysates of PLA and PHBP reduced polymer production (ca. 1.4 g/L) by both strains. Benchmark shake flask fermentations using succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol – representative monomers of poly(butylene succinate) – showed that P. sacchari efficiently converted succinic acid to PHB (2.1 g/L), whereas 1,4-butanediol led to low bacterial growth and polymer formation. Bioreactor fed-batch fermentations with P. sacchari showed that a pH-stat feeding strategy with a concentrated hydrothermal PHBP hydrolysate led to 8.2 gPHB/L (54.8 % w/w intracellular content), 0.29 g/(L·h) productivity, 0.54 g/g yield and 356 kDa weight average molecular weight. This work highlights the importance of depolymerization strategy on hydrolysate composition and microbial conversion efficiency, identifies 3HB and LA as key recyclable monomers for PHB biosynthesis, and presents a framework for thermochemical recycling of post-consumer bioplastic wastes
