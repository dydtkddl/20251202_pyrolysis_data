Effect of laser powder bed fusion process parameters on the microstructure and properties of pure tungsten Tungsten's exceptional properties are offset by manufacturing challenges for complex components due to its high melting point and brittleness. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) offers a solution, yet process-induced defects remain problematic. This study systematically investigated the effects of hatch spacing, scan speed, and laser power on the density, microstructure, mechanical properties, and thermal conductivity of LPBF-fabricated tungsten. Results demonstrate that Laser power dominantly controls densification, with optimized parameters achieving 98.5% density. Resultant properties include 406.4 HV hardness, 1031 MPa compressive strength, and 164.1 W/m·K thermal conductivity. Despite these strengths, unavoidable microcracks (attributed to high ductile-brittle transition temperature and impurities) limit tensile strength to 293.1 MPa. These findings validate LPBF's capability for refractory metal processing while highlighting the critical need for crack suppression strategies in high-performance applications..
