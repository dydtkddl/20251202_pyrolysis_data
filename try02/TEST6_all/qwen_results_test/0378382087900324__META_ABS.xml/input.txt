Product distribution and sulfur forms in the low temperature pyrolysis of a Spanish subbituminous coal The product distribution from the low temperature pyrolysis of a high sulfur Utrillas coal is studied in the 350–600°C interval. Runs were carried out under helium (0.1 MPa) in a horizontal fixed bed reactor with a heating rate of 7°C min−1. Gases from pyrolysis were analysed by gas chromatography and low temperature chars were characterized in terms of proximate and ultimate analyses, heating value and sulfur forms distribution. At 500°C and with a pyrolysis time of 1 hour the transformation of pyrite into pyrrhotite is almost complete. Organic sulfur tends to accumulate in higher temperature chars. A structural characterization of tars from different temperatures was made by FT-i.r. and 1H n.m.r. spectroscopy.
