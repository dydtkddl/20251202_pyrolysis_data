New perspectives on biomass conversion and circular economy based on Integrated Algal-Oil Palm Biorefinery framework for sustainable energy and bioproducts co-generation The concept of bioenergy co-generation with environmental remediation has gone through tectonic paradigm shift with the perspective that wealth and economic activities can be created through biomass utilization and conversion and waste valorization. In this review, the concept of Integrated Algal-Oil Palm Biorefinery as a cost-effective and innovative solution to address the Climate-Energy-Food-Water-Socio/Economy Nexus for sustainable energy production, and developments of bioproducts are elaborated. Different types of oil palm biomass and mill effluent generated are highlighted, and the technologies for environmental remediation with clean/bio-energy co-generation based on biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, biohydrogen, bio-oil, and jet biofuel with energy storage and supercapacitors are discussed. The conversion of biomass and effluent into biopolymer, graphene, biocomposites and MXene, and into biochemicals and for biomedical applications are highlighted. The importance of utilizing green and eco-friendly processes is detailed out. Finally, economical integrated algal cultivation within oil palm industrial setting for aquaculture application, with inclusive community development programs based on HEESBA philosophy to meet the agenda of global sustainable development goals is promoted.
