You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

New perspectives on biomass conversion and circular economy based on Integrated Algal-Oil Palm Biorefinery framework for sustainable energy and bioproducts co-generation The concept of bioenergy co-generation with environmental remediation has gone through tectonic paradigm shift with the perspective that wealth and economic activities can be created through biomass utilization and conversion and waste valorization. In this review, the concept of Integrated Algal-Oil Palm Biorefinery as a cost-effective and innovative solution to address the Climate-Energy-Food-Water-Socio/Economy Nexus for sustainable energy production, and developments of bioproducts are elaborated. Different types of oil palm biomass and mill effluent generated are highlighted, and the technologies for environmental remediation with clean/bio-energy co-generation based on biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, biohydrogen, bio-oil, and jet biofuel with energy storage and supercapacitors are discussed. The conversion of biomass and effluent into biopolymer, graphene, biocomposites and MXene, and into biochemicals and for biomedical applications are highlighted. The importance of utilizing green and eco-friendly processes is detailed out. Finally, economical integrated algal cultivation within oil palm industrial setting for aquaculture application, with inclusive community development programs based on HEESBA philosophy to meet the agenda of global sustainable development goals is promoted.
