Flash pyrolysis of model compounds adsorbed on catalyst surface: A method for screening catalysts for cracking of fatty molecules The aim of this study is to compare the flash pyrolysis of model fatty compounds, that were either pure or adsorbed on different solid catalysts and to use this information for the selection of catalytic materials for renewable fuel production. Myristic acid adsorbed on ZSM-5-type catalysts, methyl oleate adsorbed on γ-alumina, and oleic acid adsorbed on SAPO5-type solids were processed by flash pyrolysis at 650°C under a helium flow. The main products formed during the decomposition reaction were analyzed on line by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In every case, the presence and the nature of the catalysts induced modifications in the type, amount and distribution of the products. Flash pyrolysis of triglycerides and related compounds adsorbed on catalysts may be used as a screening test reaction for the following purposes: (i) to characterize properties of catalysts, and (ii) to confirm the presence of even minute amounts of products, especially primary reaction intermediates.
