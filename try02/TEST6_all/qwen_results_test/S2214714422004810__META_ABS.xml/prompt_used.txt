You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of the production of hydrochar from spent coffee grounds under different operating conditions An increasing amount of spent coffee grounds (SCG) has resulted in a huge burden on landfills; thus, alternative viable technologies are needed. The hydrothermal carbonization of SCG was studied to determine to produce high-quality hydrochar. The influence of three independent variables (temperature, reaction duration, and solid to liquid ratio) on the yield of hydrochar and conversion was investigated through 15 experimental runs using central composite design (CCD). The most optimized conversion and hydrochar yield results were 89.8 % and 10.1 %, respectively. Higher heating value (HHV) progressed considerably from 19.1 MJ/kg of SCG to 21.2 MJ/kg of hydrochar. The ultimate analysis results for hydrochar revealed that the quantity of carbon (C) upgraded from 50.1 to 55.9 %, whereas; oxygen (O) content decreased from 40.5 to 38.7 %, hence improving the energy and combustion properties. The Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis portrayed the alteration in the structure of SCG and improved porosity after hydrothermal processing, which was further investigated via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. BET surface area improved from 4.4 m2/g (for SCG) to 16.5 m2/g (for hydrochar). The thermal stability of hydrochar was upgraded from 330 °C for SCG to 375 °C for hydrochar.
