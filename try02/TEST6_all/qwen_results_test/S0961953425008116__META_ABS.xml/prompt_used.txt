You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of sugar beet pulp via gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production: Experimental study, optimization, and modeling Hydrogen-rich syngas production through gasification of sugar beet pulp (SBP), a byproduct of sugar processing factories, was investigated in the presence of dolomite-supported Ni and Ni-La catalysts. For this purpose, catalysts with varying metal loadings (10, 20% Ni and 10–1, 10-3% Ni-La by wt%) were synthesized via the impregnation method and characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Gasification experiments with 10% Ni/Dolomite catalyst examined the effects of gasification temperature (600, 700, and 800 °C), and equivalence ratio (ER = 0.03, 0.09, 0.15), where the highest hydrogen concentration of 23.1 mol% (2.2 mol H2/kg SBP) was achieved at 700 °C, 0.03 ER. In the subsequent steam gasification experiments, the effects of catalyst type, steam-to-biomass (S:B) ratio, reaction temperature, and gasification duration were studied. Experimental highest hydrogen concentration (61.6%) and syngas calorific value (7535 kJ/m3) were achieved with the 10-3% Ni-La/Dolomite catalyst. Optimization studies were performed using full factorial design, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Modeling of the gasification process employed Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using Keras model in Python. Optimum gasification conditions were identified as 711.20 °C, 14.58 min, and S:B = 4.99, yielding 57.7 mol% hydrogen for 10% Ni/Dolomite catalyst. This study demonstrates that optimized steam gasification effectively valorizes sugar beet pulp by achieving high hydrogen yields and concentrations.
