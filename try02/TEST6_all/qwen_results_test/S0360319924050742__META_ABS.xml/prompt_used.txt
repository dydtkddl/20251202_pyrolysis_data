You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen and syngas production from gasification of solid fuels in a reciprocating porous media reactor Natural gas supported co-combustion of gaseous and solid fuels (biomass, coal, and polyethylene) was carried out in a reciprocal porous media reactor (RFR) to evaluate the suitability of the concept for hydrogen (H2) and syngas production. The reactor was designed and built to operate in semi-continuous mode, where equivalence ratio (φ), the gasifying agent, and different particle sizes of solid fuels were assessed. Rich (φ > 1) and lean (φ < 1) combustion regime were evaluated, while steam and air/steam were used as gasifying agents. The first configuration (C1) has a solid fuel volume space with a width of 25 mm and a diameter of 40 mm, and the second configuration (C2), has a diameter of 17 mm and a height of 40 mm, both in the center of the reactor. The temperature, the reaction wave propagation rate, and the resulting concentration of the main species (H2 and CO) were measured. The maximum H2 produced was 19.63 vol%, obtained in C2 with biomass, using only air as gasifying agent. The highest efficiency (87%) was also obtained in this case. In the case of C2, the particle matter emission concentration in the case of biomass was 1.4 g/m3, mainly of PM4 and PM2.5. Chemical reactions, such as water-gas-shift, methanation, Boudouard, and others, were recognized in each experimental case. This experimental work shows promising results in the search for solutions to gasify solid fuel in continuous mode.
