You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of corn starch based biodegradable plastic plates and determination of kinetic parameters by isoconversional methods using thermogravimetric analyzer Oil shortage and awareness of environment pollution leads to the extensive use of biodegradable starch-based materials against synthetic plastics. The accumulated wastes of these plastics takes more time for natural recycling and the process is complex. Therefore the best option of recycling would be to convert these polymers into a source of energy by pyrolysis. So to understand the pyrolytic behaviour, kinetics of such waste plastics is studied by using thermogravimetric analysis at different heating rates of 10 °C, 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C in nitrogen atmosphere followed by characterization of the pyrolysis products. The kinetic parameters are obtained for two major stages of decomposition in two different temperature ranges 250–620 °C and 620–855 °C by iso-conversional methods such as Friedman, Coats-Redfern, FWO and Kissinger methods. The regression coefficient data (>0.9) of kinetic plots obtained for different methods best fits to the kinetic equation. Empirical formula of the compound is determined by ultimate analysis is CH2.214S0.0018O0.6910. Proximate analysis gives the idea of volatile component which is74.33%. The range of average value of activation energy is 120.7013 kJ/mol to 140.7707 kJ/mol for the biodegradable plastic plate with different conversion (0.1–0.6) and (0.1–0.3) respectively at two different temperatures. The pyrolysis products obtained using a semi-batch reactor are characterized to know their composition and other properties.
