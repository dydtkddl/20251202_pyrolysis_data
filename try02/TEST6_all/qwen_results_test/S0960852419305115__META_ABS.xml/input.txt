Catalytic co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and waste high-density polyethylene over faujasite-type zeolite This study investigated the catalytic co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over faujasite-type zeolite derived from electric arc furnace slag (FAU-EAFS) in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of reaction temperature, catalyst-to-feedstock ratio, and HDPE-to-SCB ratio on product fractional yields and chemical compositions were discussed. The co-pyrolysis of SCB and HDPE over FAU-EAFS increased the liquid yield and enhanced the quality of bio-oil. The maximum bio-oil (68.56 wt%) and hydrocarbon yield (74.55%) with minimum yield of oxygenated compounds (acid = 0.57% and ester = 0.67%) were achieved under the optimum experimental conditions of catalyst-to-feedstock ratio of 1:6, HDPE-to-SCB ratio of 40:60, and temperature of 500 °C. The oil produced by catalytic co-pyrolysis had higher calorific value than the oil produced by the pyrolysis of SCB alone.
