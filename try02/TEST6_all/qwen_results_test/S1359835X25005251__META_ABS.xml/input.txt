Upcycling of recycled polycarbonate: Effect of different types of biocarbon on performance of sustainable composites This study focuses on the development of sustainable biocomposites by reinforcing recycled polycarbonate (rPC) with 10 wt% biocarbon (BC) derived from the pyrolysis of coconut shell (CS), rice hull (RH), and switchgrass (SG). The novelty of this work lies in the comparative evaluation of biocarbon derived from three distinct biomass sources for the first time in rPC-based biocomposites. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of different biofillers on the mechanical, thermal, and rheological properties, with an emphasis on the flammability performances of the resulted composites. The incorporation of BC enhanced the tensile and flexural moduli by 16–20.4 % and 7.8–10.8 %, respectively, demonstrating improved stiffness. Among the fillers, SG and CS derived BC reported superior thermal stability. Rheological analysis revealed higher storage modulus for all biocomposites compared to neat rPC at lower frequencies, indicating improved viscoelastic behavior. Flammability tests showed that the composites were non-flammable in the horizontal UL 94 test, while SGBC and CSBC composites exhibited vertical after-flame time below 50 s. Notably, SGBC was identified as the most effective flame retardant and performance-enhancing filler among the three. These findings highlight the potential of SGBC to enable high-performance, sustainable composites using recycled polycarbonate, offering a promising route for circular materials engineering.
