You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical conversion of sewage sludge: A critical review The increasing levels of sewage sludge production demands research and development to introduce more commercially feasible options for reducing socio-economic and environmental problems associated with its current treatment. Sewage sludge may be processed to produce useful products or as a feedstock for energy generation. Initially, the characteristics of sewage sludge are discussed in terms of composition and the current options for its treatment with the associated environmental impacts. Processes to valorize sewage sludge are discussed, including heavy metal removal from sewage sludge, production of bio-char, production and use of activated carbon and use of sewage sludge combustion ash in cement and concrete. Thermochemical processes i.e., pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, also gasification and combustion for process intensification, energy and resource recovery from sewage sludge are then critically reviewed in detail. The pyrolysis of sewage sludge to produce a bio-oil is covered in relation to product bio-oil composition, reactor type and the use of catalysts. Gasification of sewage sludge focusses on the characteristics of the different available reactor types and the influence of a range of process parameters and catalysts on gas yield and composition. The selection and design of catalysts are of vital importance to enhance the selectivity of the selected thermochemical pyrolysis or gasification process. The catalysts used for sewage sludge treatment need more research to enable selectivity towards the targeted desired end-products along with optimization of parametric conditions and development of innovative reactor technologies. The combustion of sewage sludge is reviewed in terms of reactor technologies, flue gas cleaning systems and pollutant emissions. In addition, reactor technologies in terms of technological strength and market competitiveness with the particular application to sewage sludge are compared for the first time for thermochemical conversion. A critical comparison is made of the drying techniques, co-feedstocks and catalytic processes, reaction kinetics, reactor technologies, operating conditions to be optimized, removal of impurities, fuel properties, their constraints and required improvements. The emphasis of this review is to promote environmental sustainability for process intensification, energy and resource recovery from pyrolysis, gasification and combustion involving the use of catalysts.
