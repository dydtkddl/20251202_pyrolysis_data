You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of heat and mass transfer characteristics of metal hydride reactor for hydrogen storage using various nanofluids The execution of metal hydride reactor (MHR) for storage of hydrogen is greatly affected by thermal effects occurred throughout the sorption of hydrogen. In this paper, based on different governing equations, a numerical model of MHR filled by MmNi4.6Al0.4 is formed using ANSYS Fluent for hydrogen absorption process. The validation of model is done by relating its simulation outcomes with published experimental results and found a good agreement with a deviation of less than 5%; hence present model accuracy is considered to be more than 95%. For extraction or supply of heat, water or oil is extensively used in MHR during the absorption or the desorption process so as to improve the competency of the system. Since nanofluid (mixture of base fluid and nanoparticles) has a higher heat transfer characteristics, in this paper the nanofluid is used in place of the conventional heat transfer fluid in MHR. Further the numerical model of MHR is modified with nanofluid as heat extraction fluid and results are presented. The Al2O3/H2O, CuO/H2O and MgO/H2O nanofluids are selected and simulations are carried out. The results are obtained for different parameters like nanoparticle material, hydrogen concentration, supply pressure and cooling fluid temperature. It is seen that 5 vol% CuO/H2O nanofluid is thermally superior to Al2O3/H2O and MgO/H2O nanofluid. The heat transfer rate improves by the increment in the supply pressure of hydrogen as well as decrement in temperature of nanofluid. The CuO/H2O nanofluid increases the heat transfer rate of MHR up to 10% and the hydrogen absorption time is improved by 9.5%. Thus it is advantageous to use the nanofluid as a heat transfer cooling fluid for the MHR to store hydrogen.
