Comparison of adsorption potential of methylene blue and 17β-stradiol on biochar, activated biochar and catalytic biochar from lignocellulosic waste This work compares the adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) and 17β-stradiol (17β-S) onto biochar (B), activated biochar (AB) and catalytic biochar (CB), obtained through pyrolysis of residual lignin of the second-generation (2G) ethanol production process from a sugarcane industry. K2CO3 was used as activating agent and catalyst. Biochars were characterized by the techniques of point of zero charge, nitrogen adsorption and desorption, SEM and FTIR. Kinetic, isothermal and thermodynamic adsorption studies were carried out. Biochars behaved according to the pseudo-second order (PSO) kinetic model, with similar removal percentages of MB using AB and CB. In contrast, AB showed significantly higher removal percentages of 17β-S than CB. The Sips model agreed to isothermal adsorption data of 17β-S onto all biochars. For MB adsorption, Freundlich model agreed to data using B and AB, and Langmuir model was more suitable for CB. The process was viable, spontaneous, endothermic and showed increase in entropy, except for 17β-S adsorption onto CB. Consequently, the activated and catalytic pyrolysis processes increased the adsorptive potential of biochar derived from 2G lignocellulosic residue. Finally, CB and AB obtained significant removal percentage values of MB (85.8–99.3 %) and 17β-S (37.6–76.7 %), where CB is favorable due to its simpler preparation steps.
