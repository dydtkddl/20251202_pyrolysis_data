You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of adsorption potential of methylene blue and 17β-stradiol on biochar, activated biochar and catalytic biochar from lignocellulosic waste This work compares the adsorption capacity of methylene blue (MB) and 17β-stradiol (17β-S) onto biochar (B), activated biochar (AB) and catalytic biochar (CB), obtained through pyrolysis of residual lignin of the second-generation (2G) ethanol production process from a sugarcane industry. K2CO3 was used as activating agent and catalyst. Biochars were characterized by the techniques of point of zero charge, nitrogen adsorption and desorption, SEM and FTIR. Kinetic, isothermal and thermodynamic adsorption studies were carried out. Biochars behaved according to the pseudo-second order (PSO) kinetic model, with similar removal percentages of MB using AB and CB. In contrast, AB showed significantly higher removal percentages of 17β-S than CB. The Sips model agreed to isothermal adsorption data of 17β-S onto all biochars. For MB adsorption, Freundlich model agreed to data using B and AB, and Langmuir model was more suitable for CB. The process was viable, spontaneous, endothermic and showed increase in entropy, except for 17β-S adsorption onto CB. Consequently, the activated and catalytic pyrolysis processes increased the adsorptive potential of biochar derived from 2G lignocellulosic residue. Finally, CB and AB obtained significant removal percentage values of MB (85.8–99.3 %) and 17β-S (37.6–76.7 %), where CB is favorable due to its simpler preparation steps.
