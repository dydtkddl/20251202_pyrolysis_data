You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding the interface properties of photocatalytic reactors for rational engineering applications Photocatalytic technology, which utilizes light energy instead of the consuming of chemical reagents, is becoming a promising purification method in various wastewater treatment occasions. Compared to conventional biological methods and advanced oxidation methods, photocatalytic technology represents great inclusion and diversity. However, the practical engineering application of photocatalytic technology is still limited, mainly because of the unsatisfied separation and recovery of catalysts and their compatibility with photocatalytic reactors. The key to conquer this problem lies in the appropriate and in-depth understanding of the interface properties of scale-up photocatalytic films and devices, specifically figuring out the reliable immobilization of photocatalysts and the development of suitable application scenarios. This review focus on the immobilized photocatalysts of photocatalytic reactors for rational engineering applications Simultaneously, different types of photocatalytic reactors are evaluated and analyzed to understand their advantages and applicability. Additionally, the state-of-art and key issues of photocatalytic technology in various water treatment engineering applications are reviewed. Furthermore, the rational operation modes of photocatalytic reactors coupling with specific engineering applications are also clarified to promote the industrial application of photocatalytic technology.
