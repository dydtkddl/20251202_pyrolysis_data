Understanding the interface properties of photocatalytic reactors for rational engineering applications Photocatalytic technology, which utilizes light energy instead of the consuming of chemical reagents, is becoming a promising purification method in various wastewater treatment occasions. Compared to conventional biological methods and advanced oxidation methods, photocatalytic technology represents great inclusion and diversity. However, the practical engineering application of photocatalytic technology is still limited, mainly because of the unsatisfied separation and recovery of catalysts and their compatibility with photocatalytic reactors. The key to conquer this problem lies in the appropriate and in-depth understanding of the interface properties of scale-up photocatalytic films and devices, specifically figuring out the reliable immobilization of photocatalysts and the development of suitable application scenarios. This review focus on the immobilized photocatalysts of photocatalytic reactors for rational engineering applications Simultaneously, different types of photocatalytic reactors are evaluated and analyzed to understand their advantages and applicability. Additionally, the state-of-art and key issues of photocatalytic technology in various water treatment engineering applications are reviewed. Furthermore, the rational operation modes of photocatalytic reactors coupling with specific engineering applications are also clarified to promote the industrial application of photocatalytic technology.
