Emerging cellulose applications in the era of ecological transition The growing awareness of the environmental and economic consequences of fossil resource exploitation has intensified the search for renewable and sustainable alternatives. Among them, cellulose has emerged as a versatile and abundant biopolymer with applications in energy conversion, biofuels, batteries, optical devices, and advanced manufacturing technologies such as 3D and 4D printing. Although extensively studied, research on cellulose is rapidly evolving, focusing on challenges in processing, functionalization, and large-scale deployment. This review highlights recent advances in cellulose-based materials, emphasizing their mechanical, thermal, and optical properties, biodegradability, and contribution to the circular economy. Key challenges, including scalability, cost, and industrial feasibility, are critically assessed, alongside strategies to overcome them. The analysis suggests that cellulose can play a pivotal role in the transition to eco-friendly technologies, supporting sustainable development, climate action, and the replacement of petroleum-based materials. Finally, future research directions are outlined to enhance its integration into next-generation renewable and sustainable applications.
