Catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene in a conical spouted bed reactor The catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene (HDPE) on a HY zeolite catalyst has been carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR) at 500°C, and individual products have been monitored with the aim of obtaining product distribution data. The CSBR does not have defluidization problems in the pyrolysis of plastics. The 69wt% of the product stream corresponds to the gasoline fraction (C5–C10). It is noteworthy that this fraction fulfils European Union requirements for commercial gasoline and its RON index, 96.5, is of the same order as standard automotive fuel. The remaining products are mainly gases, especially propylene and butenes, although there is also a heavy fraction consisting of aromatics with more than one ring and unreacted waxes.
