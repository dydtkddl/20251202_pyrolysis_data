You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-inspired synthesis of Ag-g-C3N4 nanocomposites and their application for photocatalytic degradation of para-nitrophenol Nanocomposites are promising in advanced materials for environmental applications due to their ability to boost functionality through synergistic effects. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is renowned for its exceptional characteristics in photocatalysis. This work examines the preparation of g-C3N4 from different precursors, and how the presence of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and silver ions (Ag+) in g-C3N4 matrices improve their combined effect on photocatalytic activity, specifically in the degradation of para-nitrophenol (PNP), a persistent organic pollutant. From urea and melamine precursors for the preparation of g-C3N4, the latter provided a much higher yield. Using an easy synthesis approach, Ag NPs were evenly distributed in the g-C3N4 framework, whereas Ag+ ions were incorporated by an apparent physical procedure. A bio-inspired, environmentally friendly method was also applied to prepare Ag NPs. The nanocomposites showed improved light absorption and separation of charge carriers due to the synergistic interaction between g-C3N4 and Ag species. Using UV and Vis LED light sources, we investigated both pure g-C3N4 and Ag-g-C3N4 catalysts. For breaking down para-nitrophenol, the silver-modified catalysts performed significantly better than pure g-C3N4 in both UV and Vis. The study clarified the functions of Ag NPs and Ag+ ions in enhancing photocatalytic activity by examining their involvement in generating reactive oxygen species and degrading pollutants. This work highlights the capability of g-C3N4-based nanocomposites as effective photocatalysts for environmental remediation. It also explores the benefits of adding silver species to improve performance in degrading pollutants.
