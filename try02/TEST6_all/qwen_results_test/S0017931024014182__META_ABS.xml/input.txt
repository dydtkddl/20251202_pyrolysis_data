Thermodynamical performance of supercritical fuel in abrasive flow machining additive manufacturing cooling channel To improve the comprehensive heat transfer performance of regenerative cooling channels, this work investigates the effects of post-treatment roughness on the flow and heat transfer performance of supercritical hydrocarbon fuels within additive manufacturing (AM) channels. A special AM building direction is set to ensure the original roughness of the surface inside the channel is consistent, and then the initial AM rough channel is polished using abrasive flow machining (AFM) technique. The effects of post-treatment roughness on the flow resistance and heat transfer performance of supercritical hydrocarbon fuels in the cooling channel are tested at different Reynolds numbers, system pressures and heat flux. The result indicates that AFM polishing less than 10 min (Rz =25.4μm) is not conducive to the improvement of the comprehensive heat transfer capacity of the cooling channel, which manifested as performance evaluation criteria (PEC) less than 1. With the AFM polishing time increases, the internal surface roughness and the reduction of roughness in polishing of 5 min decreases. The pressure loss of AFM channel decreases with the decreasing post-treatment roughness, and the friction factor of AFM channel (Rz =7.3μm) is less than that of one third of initial channel. However, the heat transfer coefficient of AFM channel4, which is polished for 20 min and Rz= 7.3μm, is about half of that of initial channel. The Nusselt number of AFM channels decrease with the decreasing roughness, but the PEC increases. The biggest PEC of 2.5 is obtained in AFM channel4. The PEC increases with the increasing Reynolds number and system pressure, but decreases with increasing heat flux. Ultimately, novel correlations for more accurate prediction of friction factor and Nusselt number in AM channels with diverse AFM roughness are put forth.
