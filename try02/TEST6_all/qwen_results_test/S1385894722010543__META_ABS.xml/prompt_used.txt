You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

FeOx@graphitic carbon core–shell embedded in microporous N-doped biochar activated peroxydisulfate for removal of Bisphenol A: Multiple active sites induced non-radical/radical mechanism The development of novel carbocatalysts with high activity and stability is important for the rapid degradation of emerging pollutants. Fe/N co-doped biochar (FeOx@GC-NBC) was innovatively synthesized with a pyrolytic carbonization method and then used as a functional peroxydisulfate (PDS) activator to degrade Bisphenol A (BPA). FeOx@GC-NBC with an optimized Fe/N ratio modification exhibited 23.16 and 8.65-fold great activity for BPA removal compared to pristine BC and N-doped BC, respectively. Approximately 93% of total organic carbon (TOC) could be removed in the heterogeneous activation system. We attributed theexcellent performance of FeOx@GC-NBC to the following attributes: i) a microporous carbon matrix with larger specific surface area (1691.81 m2·g−1) was favorable for adsorption, exposure of catalyst active sites (e.g., Fe-Nx, Graphitic N) and electron-transfer; ii) the C–O–Fe bond and highly core–shell structure of graphitic nanosheets (FeOx@GC) enhanced the N retention ability and durability of the catalyst; iii) organics adsorption dominated by a “pore-filling and π-π interaction” mechanism effectively promoted BPA oxidation. In acidic and neutral solutions, the radical oxidation (SO4 •–and •OH) processes were responsible for BPA decomposition. In alkaline solution, electron transfer, instead of 1O2 or a high-valent iron species, was the dominant pathway. This study proposes a simple and feasible strategy to synthesize the FeOx@GC-NBC catalyst, which provides insights into catalyst design and the internal active sites involved in the purification mechanism of refractory organics.
