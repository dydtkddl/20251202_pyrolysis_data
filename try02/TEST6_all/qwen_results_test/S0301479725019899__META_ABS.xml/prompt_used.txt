You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel synergy remediation of solubilization adsorption coupled with oxidation by cyclodextrin-magnetic biochar assisted persulfate for benzo(a)pyrene-contaminated soil During biochar (BC) assisting persulfate (PS) in remediating organic contaminated soils, challenges include low electron transfer efficiency and a limited adsorption-oxidation interface, which hinder pollutant degradation under complex environmental conditions. This study prepared a biochar-based composite activator (CDMBC) by introducing iron oxides onto the biochar surface and grafting β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), and examined CDMBC's role in facilitating PS oxidation to remediate benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-contaminated soil under mild conditions. Results showed that CDMBC had a loose surface structure with partially uniform active components, strong oxidative capacity, and enhanced electron transfer ability. Under the optimal conditions of 1.00 wt% of CDMBC addition, 0.75 wt% of PS addition, 35 °C of remediation temperature, 1:2.5 of solid-liquid ratio, and 800 °C of biochar preparation temperature, the BaP removal with a maximum of 98.97 % in contaminated soil was obtained after 120 min. Of this total BaP removed, 2.74 % was via the aqueous phase, 12.41 % through adsorption on the BC surface, and 83.82 % through oxidative degradation in the soil. CDMBC exhibited stable performance during repeated recycling and significantly reduced soil toxicity after remediation. CDMBC's loose structure, conductive magnetic particles, and solubilizing β-CD enhanced electron transfer and BaP adsorption, promoting BaP desorption from soil particles into the aqueous phase. Through the combined actions of solubilizing adsorption, reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation, singlet oxygen (1O2) - electron transfer - surface active groups oxidation, BaP in contaminated soil was decomposed into CO2, H2O, etc., hence facilitating significant remediation. Overall, this synergistic effect of solubilizing adsorption - oxidation provides a novel approach for BC-assisted PS remediation of organic-contaminated soils with substantial potential for practical applications.
