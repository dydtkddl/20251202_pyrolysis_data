Characterization of biocomposite using coconut oil impregnated biochar as latent heat storage insulation Objective of this research was to characterize properties of the latent heat storage biocomposite (LHSBC) as a novel material that can be employed as a latent heat storage insulation by using biochar. Biochars produced from waste material pine cone, pine saw dust, and paper mill sludge were vacuum impregnated with a bio-based phase change material (PCM), coconut oil, to prepare LHSBCs. In particular, this paper analyzed the chemical stability, latent heat storage performance, thermal conductivity, and thermal stability of LHSBCs based on results of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), laser flash method and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As a result, the LHSBCs showed a maximum latent heat storage capacity of 74.6 J/g and a low thermal conductivity of 0.030 W/mK at the maximum, confirming that LHSBCs have a high latent heat storage capacity and thermal insulation performance. With a maximum specific heat of 1.69 J/gK, a high, sensible heat storage was confirmed. In addition, all LHSBCs were found to be thermally and chemically stable. The LHSBC could be employed as a material with good thermal insulation performance and heat storage characteristics.
