You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of biocomposite using coconut oil impregnated biochar as latent heat storage insulation Objective of this research was to characterize properties of the latent heat storage biocomposite (LHSBC) as a novel material that can be employed as a latent heat storage insulation by using biochar. Biochars produced from waste material pine cone, pine saw dust, and paper mill sludge were vacuum impregnated with a bio-based phase change material (PCM), coconut oil, to prepare LHSBCs. In particular, this paper analyzed the chemical stability, latent heat storage performance, thermal conductivity, and thermal stability of LHSBCs based on results of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), laser flash method and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As a result, the LHSBCs showed a maximum latent heat storage capacity of 74.6 J/g and a low thermal conductivity of 0.030 W/mK at the maximum, confirming that LHSBCs have a high latent heat storage capacity and thermal insulation performance. With a maximum specific heat of 1.69 J/gK, a high, sensible heat storage was confirmed. In addition, all LHSBCs were found to be thermally and chemically stable. The LHSBC could be employed as a material with good thermal insulation performance and heat storage characteristics.
