You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design of a hemispherical reactor with radiation regulation for efficient solar thermochemical fuel production Solar thermochemical cycle (STC) for CO2 splitting offer a promising pathway for sustainable fuel production. The key performance indicator is solar-to-fuel efficiency, which is highly dependent on regulating incident solar radiation and minimizing re-radiation loss during the temperature swing of two-step solar thermochemical cycle. In this study, we propose a hemispherical fixed-bed reactor design incorporating a spectrally-selective transmissive window and a variable iris. This configuration shall facilitate rapid redox cycle with reduced energy losses, thereby enhancing solar-to-fuel efficiency, feedstock conversion, and power output. A comprehensive thermodynamic model is developed to evaluate the reactor's performance under practical operating limits, including low concentration ratios and fluctuating direct normal irradiance (DNI). For a typical ceria-based solar thermochemical cycle operating between 900 °C and 1600 °C, results show that the new window design could reduce re-radiation loss by 72.09 %, increasing solar-to-fuel efficiency from 11.09 % to 12.10 % under a 1700 nm cut-off wavelength and a 40 mm aperture radius (concentration ratio of 3500). The application of the spectrally-selective transmissive coating to quartz window would enable solar-to-fuel efficiencies exceeding 11 % at moderate concentration ratios (1000−3000). The selective coating would also reduce solar mirror area by 38.00 % at concentration ratio of ∼1400, lowering the total cost of solar concentrating system by 33.18 %. Furthermore, multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II identifies optimal trade-offs, achieving simultaneous enhancements in solar-to-fuel efficiency, feedstock conversion, and power output to approximately 11 %, 15 %, and 1 kW, respectively. This innovative reactor window design provides a viable strategy for achieving efficient and rapid solar thermochemical cycle under real on-sun scenarios.
