Production and characterization of lignin and cellulose fractions obtained from pretreated vine shoots by microwave assisted alkali treatment This work deals with the optimization of the second stage of a biorefinery scheme to separate simultaneously cellulose and lignin from hydrothermally pre-treated vine shoots. For this, the suitability of the microwave-assisted alkaline delignification was assessed and optimized through a Box-Wilson experimental design. The optimum conditions (150 °C, 6 wt% NaOH, 30 min) allowed maximizing the lignin removal (82 wt%) and minimizing the loss of the cellulose (35 wt%) present in the pre-treated vine shoots. A thorough characterization of the two fractions obtained at optimum conditions was performed: the cellulose rich solid was analyzed by XRD and FTIR and the lignin was subjected to HPSEC, Py/GC–MS, 13C- and 1H NMR. This purposed second stage would allow performing an integral biorefinery with low energy requirements and environmentally friendly conditions. This approach aligns with the circular economy and the zero waste production philosophies, promoting the sustainable development.
