You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocolloid-based coatings applied on biobased/biodegradable food flexible packaging, A review. Part 1 - Biopolymer to coat and available technologies The shift towards sustainable food packaging has intensified research into hydrocolloid-based coatings applied to biobased and biodegradable flexible films. Indeed, most of the biobased and/or biodegradable film available for the food market exhibits too low properties, but that could be compensated by coating applications. This review explores the potential of hydrocolloids as coating materials to improve the functional properties of sustainable flexible packaging such as polylactides, polyhydroxyalkanoates, thermoplastic starch, polycaprolactone. Hydrocolloid-based coatings, including proteins, polysaccharides, and their composites, are particularly promising due to their ability to improve barrier, surface and mechanical performance while maintaining biodegradability and food safety. The choice of technique for coating application depends on the desired coating thickness, adhesion strength, and functional enhancements. Various coating technologies are discussed, ranging from solvent-free (dry) processes, such as extrusion-lamination and hot press techniques, to wet-based (solvent) methods, including solution casting, spray coating, electrospinning, etc. Surface treatments, such as plasma activation, are often required before coating application to enhance adhesion, wettability, and mechanical resistance. This review provides an in-depth analysis of available biodegradable polymer films suitable for coating and food applications and the coating technologies, setting the foundation for the development of next-generation eco-friendly packaging films.
