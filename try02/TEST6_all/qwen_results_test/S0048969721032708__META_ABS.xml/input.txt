Bioenergy from dairy manure: technologies, challenges and opportunities Dairy manure (DM) is a kind of cheap cellulosic biomass resource which includes lignocellulose and mineral nutrients. Random stacks not only leads damage to the environment, but also results in waste of natural resources. The traditional ways to use DM include returning it to the soil or acting as a fertilizer, which could reduce environmental pollution to some extent. However, the resource utilization rate is not high and socio-economic performance is not utilized. To expand the application of DM, more and more attention has been paid to explore its potential as bioenergy or bio-chemicals production. This article presented a comprehensive review of different types of bioenergy production from DM and provided a general overview for bioenergy production. Importantly, this paper discussed potentials of DM as candidate feedstocks not only for biogas, bioethanol, biohydrogen, microbial fuel cell, lactic acid, and fumaric acid production by microbial technology, but also for bio-oil and biochar production through apyrolysis process. Additionally, the use of manure for replacing freshwater or nutrients for algae cultivation and cellulase production were also discussed. Overall, DM could be a novel suitable material for future biorefinery. Importantly, considerable efforts and further extensive research on overcoming technical bottlenecks like pretreatment, the effective release of fermentable sugars, the absence of robust organisms for fermentation, energy balance, and life cycle assessment should be needed to develop a comprehensive biorefinery model.
