Co-pyrolysis of polymers: Recent advances, challenges and perspectives In recent decades, the use of polymers, including plastics and tires, has dramatically increased. Large quantities of plastic and tire waste are generated and enter the environment, causing long-lasting ecological problems for mankind because they are extremely difficult to degrade naturally. It is imperative to find a solution to handle and recycle waste plastics and tires. Co-pyrolysis of polymers with biomass, coal and other materials is a promising method for recovering polymers and producing fuels and other value-added materials. This review focuses on various types of polymer co-pyrolysis, such as plastic-biomass, plastic-coal, tire-biomass, tire-coal, and plastic-tire co-pyrolysis. The study pays attention to the kinetics calculation and synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis. Furthermore, the influence of factors such as temperature, reactants, and catalysts on the co-pyrolysis process is discussed. The study also delves into the solid, liquid, and gaseous products of co-pyrolysis and explores potential applications. Additionally, the application of machine learning in co-pyrolysis research is highlighted. The goal is to provide viable pathways for the efficient recycling of polymers, enhance waste management, and achieve synergistic effects in energy and value-added product recovery.
