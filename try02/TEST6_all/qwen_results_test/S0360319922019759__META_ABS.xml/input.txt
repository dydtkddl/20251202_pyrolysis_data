Co-gasification of coal gangue and pine sawdust on a self-made two-stage fixed bed: Effect of mixing ratio In this paper, the synergistic effect of co-gasification for coal gangue and pine sawdust was studied on a self-made two-stage gasification fixed bed experimental device. The results indicated that there was synergistic effect between coal gangue and pine sawdust. With the gasification temperature was 850 °C, the catalytic reforming temperature was 900 °C, the steam flow was 2 ml/min and the mixing ratio of coal gangue and pine sawdust was 1:1. The co-gasification synergistic effect yields the best results, the H2 volume fraction reached its highest value of 37.2%, with a synergistic coefficient of 0.22. Under this condition, the number of mesopores in co-gasification char was the largest and the absorbance of the hydroxyl (-OH) functional group was the smallest. The alkali metal (K, Ca) content reached a maximum of 22.18%, which was conducive to the formation of hydrogen.
