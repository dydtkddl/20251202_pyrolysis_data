You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of plastic waste types on pyrolysis liquid oil This paper aims to examine the effect of different plastic waste types such as polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on the yield and quality of produced liquid oil from the pyrolysis process. A small pilot scale pyrolysis reactor was commissioned for this purpose, and operated at optimum temperature and retention time of 450 °C and 75 min respectively. PS plastic waste showed maximum production of liquid oil (80.8%) along with least production of gases (13%) and char (6.2%) in comparison to other plastic types. Liquid oils from all plastic types contained mostly aromatic compounds with some alkanes and alkenes. Liquid oil from PS pyrolysis contained styrene (48.3%), ethylbenzene (21.2%) and toluene (25.6%). Pyrolysis liquid oils found to have ranges of dynamic viscosity (1.77–1.90 mPa s), kinematic viscosity (1.92–2.09 cSt), density (0.91–0.92 g/cm3), pour point (−11(-60 °C)), freezing point (−15-(-65 °C)), flash point (28.1–30.2 °C) and high heating value (HHV) (41.4–41.8 MJ/kg) similar to conventional diesel, thus have potential as an alternative energy source for electricity generation. Upgrading of liquid oil using different post-treatment methods such as distillation, refining and blending with conventional diesel is required to make it suitable as a transport fuel due to presence of high aromatic compounds. The recovery of aromatic compounds especially styrene from pyrolysis oil can be a potential source of precursor chemical in industries for polymerization of styrene monomers.
