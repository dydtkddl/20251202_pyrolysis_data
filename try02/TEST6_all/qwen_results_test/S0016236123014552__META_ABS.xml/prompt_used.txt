You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biohydrogen production through dark fermentation from waste biomass: Current status and future perspectives on biorefinery development Green and clean hydrogen production has become a significant focus in recent years to achieve sustainable renewable energy fuel needs. Biohydrogen production through the dark fermentation (DF) process from organic wastes is advantageous with its environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and cost-effective characteristics. This article elucidates the viability of transforming the DF process into a biorefinery system. Operational pH, temperature, feeding rate, inoculum-to-substrate ratio, and hydrogen partial pressure and its liquid-to-gas mass transfer rate are the factors that govern the performance of the DF process. Sufficient research has been made that can lead to upscaling the DF process into an industrial-scale technology. However, the DF process cannot be upscaled at the current technology readiness level as a stand-alone technology. Hence, it requires a downstream process (preferably anaerobic digestion) to improve energy recovery efficiency and economic viability. The article also discusses the possible hydrogen purification and storage techniques for achieving fuel quality and easy accessibility. The article further tries to unfold the opportunities, challenges, and current scenario/future research directions to enhance hydrogen yield and microbial metabolism, depicting the commercialization status for biorefinery development. Finally, the current progress gaps and policy-level loopholes from the Indian perspective are highlighted by analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
