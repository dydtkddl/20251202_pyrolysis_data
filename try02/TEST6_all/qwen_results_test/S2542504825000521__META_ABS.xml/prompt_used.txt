You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microencapsulation of clean gaseous fire-extinguishing agents for fire-retardant coatings Most initial fires that originate in confined spaces cannot be effectively controlled by automatic fire suppression systems. Microcapsule fire-extinguishing agents, which exhibit stimulus-responsive behavior, are not constrained by storage and transportation conditions, thus enabling efficient suppression of initial fires. However, microencapsulation of low-boiling-point gaseous fire-extinguishing agents remains a significant challenge. In this study, fire-extinguishing microcapsules with both automatic response and fire suppression functions were successfully fabricated via suspension polymerization. These microcapsules have a stable core-shell structure with a robust, airtight shell, and effectively encapsulating the fire-extinguishing agent in a high-pressure liquefied state. By optimizing the formulation and preparation parameters, their morphologies and thermal responses were analyzed. The resulting microcapsules exhibited uniform particle size, optimal shape, targeted temperature-triggered release, and high encapsulation ratio and efficiency. They also demonstrated good storage stability and outstanding performance in laboratory fire suppression tests. When incorporated into flammable resins, they significantly enhanced their flame retardancy. This study shows promise for fire safety in confined areas and applications for fire-retardant coatings.
