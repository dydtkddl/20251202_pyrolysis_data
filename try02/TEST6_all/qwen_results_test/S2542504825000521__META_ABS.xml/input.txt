Microencapsulation of clean gaseous fire-extinguishing agents for fire-retardant coatings Most initial fires that originate in confined spaces cannot be effectively controlled by automatic fire suppression systems. Microcapsule fire-extinguishing agents, which exhibit stimulus-responsive behavior, are not constrained by storage and transportation conditions, thus enabling efficient suppression of initial fires. However, microencapsulation of low-boiling-point gaseous fire-extinguishing agents remains a significant challenge. In this study, fire-extinguishing microcapsules with both automatic response and fire suppression functions were successfully fabricated via suspension polymerization. These microcapsules have a stable core-shell structure with a robust, airtight shell, and effectively encapsulating the fire-extinguishing agent in a high-pressure liquefied state. By optimizing the formulation and preparation parameters, their morphologies and thermal responses were analyzed. The resulting microcapsules exhibited uniform particle size, optimal shape, targeted temperature-triggered release, and high encapsulation ratio and efficiency. They also demonstrated good storage stability and outstanding performance in laboratory fire suppression tests. When incorporated into flammable resins, they significantly enhanced their flame retardancy. This study shows promise for fire safety in confined areas and applications for fire-retardant coatings.
