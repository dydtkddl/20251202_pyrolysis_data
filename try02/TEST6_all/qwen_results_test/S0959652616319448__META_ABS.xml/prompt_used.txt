You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of Napier grass via intermediate pyrolysis: Optimization using response surface methodology and pyrolysis products characterization This study presents first optimization report on pyrolysis oil derived from Napier grass. Effects of temperature, heating rate and nitrogen flow rate on the intermediate pyrolysis of Napier grass biomass in a vertical fixed-bed tubular reactor were investigated collectively. Response surface methodology with central composite design was used for modelling the process and optimization of the process variables. Individual second order polynomial model was found to be adequate in predicting bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas yield. The optimum bio-oil yield of 50.57 wt% was recorded at 600 °C, 50 °C/min and 5 L/min nitrogen flow. The bio-oil obtained throughout this study was two-phase liquid, organic and aqueous phase. The bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas were characterized using standard analytical techniques. The results revealed that the organic phase consists of hydrocarbons and various benzene derivatives, which can be further processed into fuels and valuable chemicals. The aqueous phase was predominantly water, acids, ketones, aldehydes and some phenolics and other water-soluble organics. The non-condensable gas was made up high hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio suitable for liquid fuel synthesis via Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis. The bio-char was a porous carbonaceous material with high energy content, which can be applied as a solid fuel, adsorbent or source of biofertilizer. This study demonstrated that Napier grass biomass is a viable feedstock for production of high-value bioenergy precursors.
