Nanoparticulate pollutants in the environment: Analytical methods, formation, and transformation The wide application of nanomaterials and plastic products generates a substantial number of nanoparticulate pollutants in the environment. Nanoparticulate pollutants are quite different from their bulk counterparts because of their unique physicochemical properties, which may pose a threat to environmental organisms and human beings. To accurately predict the environmental risks of nanoparticulate pollutants, great efforts have been devoted to developing reliable methods to define their occurrence and track their fate and transformation in the environment. Herein, we summarized representative studies on the preconcentration, separation, formation, and transformation of nanoparticulate pollutants in environmental samples. Finally, some perspectives on future research directions are proposed.
