Effect of ramial chipped wood and poultry manure amendments on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in Benin This study investigated effects of soil amendments with ramial chipped wood (RCW) derived from Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius, together with poultry manure, on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in northern and southern Benin. The trial was a split-plot experiment, where treatments included volume of irrigation water (V1 and V2 = 0.5 *V1) as the whole-plot factor, with organic amendment (45 t/ha RCW; 15 t/ha poultry manure, PM; 45 t/ha RCW + 15 t/ha of PM, RCW_PM; and control) as the sub-plot factor. Topsoil was sampled before and after 24 months of in situ organic amendment application. Humic acid (HA) was extracted from soil and purified prior to FTIR spectroscopy, NMR, and Py-GC-MS analyses. RCW treatments (RCW and RCW_PM) contributed substantially to organic carbon storage and soil nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) increases (the latter by up to 1.5 times) compared to the control. Accordingly, soils that were amended with the RCW produced significant amounts of HA. High concentrations of lignin-related compounds were determined in pyrolysis products from humic acids in the RCW-amended soils. Using ITS2 region sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform, RCW amendments markedly altered fungal compositions, with increased relative abundance of Ascomycota (up to 92% of total fungal community), Mucoromycota (2.7%), Basidiomycota (2.5%) and Rozellomycota (0.3%). These fungal phyla contain species that participate in organic matter decomposition and compound transformations but did not selectively degrade lignin in RCW. Our results suggest that RCW amendments significantly increased fungal activity and improved soil nutrient availability. Thus, this agrotechnology is recommended for regenerative agriculture.
