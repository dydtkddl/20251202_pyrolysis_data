Vacuum pyrolysis of lignin derived from steam-exploded wood Vacuum pyrolysis of 100 g of lignin derived from steam explosion of wood yielded 42.7% oil, 38.0% charcoal, 10.0% gas and 9.3% pyrolytic water (wt. %, moisture and ash-free basis) at 465°C and below 2 kPa absolute pressure. The pyrolysis oil was fractionated into eight fractions, F1–F8. F1 and F2 were mainly hydrocarbons and accounted for 3.4% of the anhydrous oil. F3 to F7 were mainly mono and diphenols and represented 41.6% of the anhydrous oil. F8 had very low GC/MS response due to its low volatility and/or high polarity. It may be possible to use directly fractions F3 to F7 in phenolic resin formulation.
