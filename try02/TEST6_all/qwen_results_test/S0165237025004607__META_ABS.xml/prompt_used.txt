You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic upcycling of plastic waste into graphene and carbon nanostructures The escalating accumulation of plastic waste poses a significant environmental challenge, while the high cost of graphene production limits its widespread application. Addressing both issues, this study presents a sustainable and efficient approach to upcycle plastic waste into graphene-like carbon nanostructures with tailored morphology. A two-stage catalytic pyrolysis process was employed to convert common plastic wastes— high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate—into graphitic nanomaterials and hydrogen-rich gases. To enhance efficiency, bimetallic catalysts (Fe–Ni, Co–Fe, Co–Ni) supported on MgO were synthesized using impregnation and coprecipitation methods. Among these, Fe–Ni–Mg prepared via coprecipitation exhibited the highest catalytic activity, yielding carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen. Polystyrene waste produced the highest yield of graphene-like multiwalled carbon nanotubes, while polyethylene terephthalate was less effective due to its oxygen-rich composition. Structural and morphological analyses confirmed the formation of layered and tubular graphene-like carbon with high surface area. The resulting materials demonstrated excellent adsorption capacities for heavy metal ions, highlighting their potential in wastewater treatment. This study offers a scalable, low-cost solution for plastic waste valorization and graphene synthesis, contributing to environmental remediation and the development of affordable graphene alternatives for industrial applications.
