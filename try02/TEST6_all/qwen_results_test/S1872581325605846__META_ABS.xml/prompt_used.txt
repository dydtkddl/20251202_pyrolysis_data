You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of Mg, Ce and Cu modified Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for dry reforming reaction of pyrolysis gas from waste polyethylene plastic and CO2 Pyrolysis gas of polyethylene exhibits a complex composition, predominantly comprising ethylene, methane, and propylene. Nickel-based catalysts are often used for dry reforming of methane, but suffer from metal sintering and carbon deposition. On the basis of Ni/γ-Al2O3, Mg, Ce and Cu were added to improve the stability in this work. Through experiments on cracking and dry reforming of pyrolysis gas, activation effects of Ni on pyrolysis gas and CO2 were investigated, along with effect of promoters on carbon deposition. The stability and mechanism of carbon deposition were further studied for the optimal catalyst. The results indicate that CH4 predominantly undergoes C−H bond dissociation at Ni active sites, with Ni demonstrating 10.2-fold maximum H2 yield higher than γ-Al2O3. C2H4 achieves moderate activation on γ-Al2O3 surfaces, Ni incorporation enhances dehydrogenation kinetics. C3H6 exhibits strong intrinsic activation on γ-Al2O3, with Ni providing limited synergistic effects. Activation of CO2 predominantly relies on Ni active sites, exhibiting 7.0-, 1.9-, and 2.1-fold enhancements in maximum CO production rates compared to γ-Al2O3 during the dry reforming of methane, ethylene and propylene respectively. Ce emerges as the optimal promoter, achieving a marked 93% reduction in total carbon deposition on 10NiAl. The oxygen vacancy in CeO2 can activate CO2 to realize lattice oxygen regeneration. The lattice oxygen can migrate to Ni-Ce interface, effectively compensating for oxygen vacancies surrounding Ni. This study provides a new way for resource recovery from waste polyethylene plastics.
