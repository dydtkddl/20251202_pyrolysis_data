You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Additive manufacturing of Invar 36 alloy Invar 36 alloy, renowned for its ultra-low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), is a functional Fe–Ni alloy that finds wide applications in aerospace and precision instruments. Additive manufacturing (AM), as a rapid digital manufacturing process, can efficiently and flexibly fabricate Invar 36 alloy parts with complex geometric and exceptional properties. Considering the advantages of AM and the increasing interest and demand for Invar 36 alloy parts fabrication by AM in recent years, it is imperative to provide a comprehensive summary of the current research status and technological advancements pertaining to AM Invar 36 alloy. Firstly, an overview of the AM processes currently employed for fabricating Invar 36 alloy is provided, including laser powder bed fusion, selective laser sintering, directed energy deposition, cold spray additive manufacturing, wire arc additive manufacturing, and binder jetting. Additionally, the microstructure, mechanical properties, and CTE of Invar 36 alloy manufactured by AM are summarized. Even eliminating the post heat treatment, the as-printed Invar 36 alloy can achieve excellent low CTE and mechanical properties, comparable to or exceeding traditional manufacturing processes. Moreover, the advantages and research progress of AM Invar 36 alloy composites are introduced. Enhancing mechanical properties while reducing CTE is a common challenge for both AM Invar 36 alloy and Invar composites. Finally, the technical gaps, research trends, and potential applications of AM Invar 36 alloy are summarized and prospected.
