You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of rubber seed oil and industrial hemp stem: Asym2sig deconvolution, thermal behavior, synergistic reaction and kinetic Evaluation of Kinetic triplets and thermodynamics of the co-pyrolysis of industrial hemp stem (IHS) and rubber seed oil (RSO) contributes to the efficient utilization of agricultural waste. The thermodynamics and kinetics of four pseudo components from mixture (RSO: IHS=1: 1) are investigated using Asym2sig deconvolution. The results show that the Eα of pseudo hemicellulose, pseudo cellulose, pseudo triglyceride and pseudo lignin are 76.019, 193.587, 231.764 and 408.552 kJ/mol. The average differences in Eα and ΔH for the four pseudo-fractions also are 4.439, 4.929, 5.576 and 6.018 kJ/mol. Lower energy barrier favors the reaction. The frequency factor values for four pseudo-components pyrolysis are 1.07 × 108 s−1 for pseudo hemicellulose, 1.78 × 1019 s−1 for pseudo cellulose, 6.04 × 1018 s−1 for pseudo triglyceride, and 6.96 × 1031 s−1 for pseudo lignin. The four pseudo-components have different pyrolysis reaction mechanisms. The synergistic effect calculations show a significant interaction between RSO and IHS. According to thermodynamic analysis, the pyrolysis of the four pseudo components requires the provision of external energy. FT-IR results indicate that RSO can significantly increase the release of C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4 during the co-pyrolysis of RSO and IHS. The co-pyrolysis of IHS and RSO can increase the content of alkene, alkane and MAHs, which improve the quality of bio-oil significantly. Besides, it can reduce the content of PAHs, which reduces the viscosity of the bio-oil. The results can provide new insights into the synergistic and efficient disposal of triglycerides and lignocellulosic biomass.
