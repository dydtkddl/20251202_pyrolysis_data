Interfacial effect on photo-oxidation of PP via model blends The interface in multiphase material plays an important role not only in mechanical properties, but also in aging behavior. This article uses polypropylene/polymethyl methacrylate (PP/PMMA) and polypropylene/polystyrene (PP/PS) blends (PMMA and PS as dispersion phase) as models to investigate the interfacial effect on the photo-oxidative aging of PP. The chemical property and stability of dispersed phase could make big difference on aging behavior of PP. PMMA, with polar functional group at the interface, accelerated the photo-oxidation of PP, while PS, with inert functional group at the interface, had little influence. Both the dispersion phases have little effects on crystallization of PP and the oxygen diffusion. The photo degradation product of PMMA could help to initiate or accelerate aging of PP mainly via free radicals transfer. Grafting reaction happened in the interface and the interfacial cohesion of PP and PMMA enhanced thereby.
