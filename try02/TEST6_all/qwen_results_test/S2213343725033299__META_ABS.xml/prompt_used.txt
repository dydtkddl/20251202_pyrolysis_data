You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plasma-pretreatment of catalysts effect on hydrogen and carbon nanotubes production from polyethylene syngas reforming: Understanding the variation of metal-support interaction In this study, the effects of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma pretreatment on catalysts with different metal-support interactions (MSI) in the process of converting polyethylene-derived syngas into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated. Three catalysts with distinct MSI—Ni/ZSM-5, NiMn/ZSM-5, and LaNiO3—were synthesized to evaluate the impact of plasma pretreatment on their structural properties and catalytic performance. Plasma pretreatment triggers partial pore collapse and active metal fragmentation via the synergistic action of energetic electrons, reactive species, and high-frequency electric fields, leading to reduction of particle size and improvement of dispersion. The amplified vibrations of nickel particles increase the exposed surface area and concurrently result in the degradation of MSI, especially. catalysts with initially weak MSI (Ni-ZSM-5 and NiMn-ZSM-5), causing facilitating amorphous carbon deposition and catalyst deactivation. In contrast, for LaNiO3 with strong intrinsic MSI, plasma pretreatment enhances the exposure of active Ni particle, improving catalytic activity and boosting both hydrogen and CNT yields (52.3 % and 5.92 g/gcatalyst, respectively). These findings suggest that plasma pretreatment is an effective strategy to modulate MSI and optimize performance, particularly for catalysts with strong MSI.
