Plasma-pretreatment of catalysts effect on hydrogen and carbon nanotubes production from polyethylene syngas reforming: Understanding the variation of metal-support interaction In this study, the effects of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma pretreatment on catalysts with different metal-support interactions (MSI) in the process of converting polyethylene-derived syngas into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated. Three catalysts with distinct MSI—Ni/ZSM-5, NiMn/ZSM-5, and LaNiO3—were synthesized to evaluate the impact of plasma pretreatment on their structural properties and catalytic performance. Plasma pretreatment triggers partial pore collapse and active metal fragmentation via the synergistic action of energetic electrons, reactive species, and high-frequency electric fields, leading to reduction of particle size and improvement of dispersion. The amplified vibrations of nickel particles increase the exposed surface area and concurrently result in the degradation of MSI, especially. catalysts with initially weak MSI (Ni-ZSM-5 and NiMn-ZSM-5), causing facilitating amorphous carbon deposition and catalyst deactivation. In contrast, for LaNiO3 with strong intrinsic MSI, plasma pretreatment enhances the exposure of active Ni particle, improving catalytic activity and boosting both hydrogen and CNT yields (52.3 % and 5.92 g/gcatalyst, respectively). These findings suggest that plasma pretreatment is an effective strategy to modulate MSI and optimize performance, particularly for catalysts with strong MSI.
