You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Studies on individual pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of corn cob and polyethylene: Thermal degradation behavior, possible synergism, kinetics, and thermodynamic analysis The knowledge on thermo-kinetics, synergistic effect, and reaction mechanism of pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastics is crucial for designing efficient reactor system and subsequently the pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis process. The present work explores thermal response, kinetics, reaction mechanism and thermodynamic analysis of pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of individual corn cob (CC) and polyethylene (PE), and their blend in the ratio of 3:1 (w/w). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data was obtained under inert atmosphere at various heating rates of 10, 20, and 30 °C/min and synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis of CC and PE is discussed. The obtained TGA data was processed using various model-free isoconversional methods like KAS, FWO, Friedman, Starink, and Vyazovkin for determination of kinetics of pyrolysis/co-pyrolysis process of CC and PE. Average activation energy for CC pyrolysis was estimated to be 240 ± 51.25 kJ/mol, 240 ± 51.51 kJ/mol, 237 ± 49.67 kJ/mol, and 245 ± 52.10 kJ/mol according to KAS, Starink, FWO, and Vyazovkin models, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the variation in reported values of activation energy was not significantly different (p = 0.994). Similar statistically insignificant difference was also observed for pyrolysis of PE and co-pyrolysis of CC and PE. Results showed that co-pyrolysis (CC + PE) requires 10% less activation energy than pyrolysis of CC alone. For the co-pyrolysis process, the extent of synergistic effect was discussed by difference in mass loss (ΔW). Investigation also revealed that residue left for co-pyrolysis of CC and PE is 50% less than pyrolysis of CC alone showing synergistic effect during co-pyrolysis. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated to illustrate complex mechanism of the process. Third order reaction, 3D diffusion Jander, and Ginstling–Brounshtein (D4) models were found to be best fitted for CC pyrolysis, PE pyrolysis, and co-pyrolysis, respectively. Results obtained are expected to be useful in the design of corn cob and waste polyethylene co-pyrolysis systems.
