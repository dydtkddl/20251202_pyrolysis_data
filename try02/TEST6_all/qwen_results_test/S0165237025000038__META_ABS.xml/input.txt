Waste plastic pyrolysis oils are promising feedstock for sustainable monomers production via steam cracking process Waste plastics pyrolysis oil (WPPO) is currently reprocessed to fuel components and ultimately combusted. Since some of these oils contain fragments of hydrocarbon chains, they are a promising candidate feedstock for a steam-cracking process for the production of sustainable monomers and chemicals. However, little is known about their cracking behavior. We performed micro-pyrolysis experiments with various WPPO samples and compared the yields of essential products to those of a traditional naphtha feedstock. We found that some WPPOs provided deeply reduced yields of the desired products, while others provided yields comparable or superior to typical naphtha (the highest yields were 32 % ethylene and 16 % propylene). Therefore, some WPPOs could replace a part of crude oil-based feedstock. We found that the product yields obtained from individual WPPOs differed substantially and were not easily predictable from basic feedstock characterization data. These findings reinforce the importance of the experimental research. The micro-pyrolysis technique showed a spectacular property as a selection method reflecting product yields.
