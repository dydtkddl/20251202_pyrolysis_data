You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Deep eutectic solvents for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass: Towards circular bioeconomy This review critically evaluates the potential of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) for sustainable biofuels and biochemicals production, with a focus on pretreatment of LCB using deep eutectic solvents (DESs). DESs emerged as a green pretreatment for LCB’s complex structure since they exhibit high selectivity in lignin removal while, preserving cellulose and hemicellulose. This is achieved by breaking ether bonds within lignin-carbohydrate complex and ether/ester bonds between hemicellulose and lignin. From existing studies, choline chloride-lactic acid was the most effective DESs for biomass pretreatment able to achieve lignin content as low as 18.8 % as compared to untreated biomass of 31.6 %. However, limited research focuses on comprehensive evaluation to understand the impacts of DESs and LCB structure under varying conditions such as temperature, pressure, pH, solvent concentration, reaction time, mixing and agitation, substrate compatibility and environmental factors which are crucial for scaling up and downstream application. Further research is needed to optimize and assess performance of DESs under diverse conditions with a focus on economic and scalability by evaluating non-degradative DESs recycling methods, varying water content in DESs reactions, enhancing reusability through encapsulation of DESs and synthesizing low-cost DESs from naturally available components. By addressing these challenges, use of DESs can shift towards sustainable biofuel production through efficient biomass delignification and conversion, advancing circular bioeconomy goals. This review discusses pretreatments of LCB emphasizing on DESs for green conversion of LCB into biofuels and biochemicals and is particularly unique in its integrated discussion towards circular bioeconomy concepts, employing green chemistry principles and techno-economic assessment.
