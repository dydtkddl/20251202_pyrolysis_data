You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study and kinetic modeling of kerosene thermal cracking Thermal cracking of kerosene for producing ethylene and propylene has been studied in an experimental setup. A set of experiments were designed using Response Surface Design (Box Behnken) method. In these experiments, the coil outlet temperature (COT), residence time and steam ratio varied from 795°C, 0.13s and 0.6 to 838°C, 0.27s and 1.0, respectively. Obtained maximum ethylene and propylene yield in these experiments were 32 and 16.9wt.%, respectively. In next step of studies, we tried to develop an applicable kinetic model to predict yield distribution of products of the kerosene thermal cracking. Therefore, a reaction mechanism is generated on the basis of major reactions classes in the pyrolysis and feed compounds using some simplification assumptions in the model. This semi-mechanistic kinetic model contains 172 reactions, 22 molecular and 29 radical species. A sensitivity analysis was done on kinetic model and controlling reactions identified. An objective function was defined and used to tune the model with experimental data. Finally, the calculated model results were compared with the experimental data. Scatter diagrams showed good agreement between model and experimental data.
