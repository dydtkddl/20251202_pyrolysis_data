Experimental study and kinetic modeling of kerosene thermal cracking Thermal cracking of kerosene for producing ethylene and propylene has been studied in an experimental setup. A set of experiments were designed using Response Surface Design (Box Behnken) method. In these experiments, the coil outlet temperature (COT), residence time and steam ratio varied from 795°C, 0.13s and 0.6 to 838°C, 0.27s and 1.0, respectively. Obtained maximum ethylene and propylene yield in these experiments were 32 and 16.9wt.%, respectively. In next step of studies, we tried to develop an applicable kinetic model to predict yield distribution of products of the kerosene thermal cracking. Therefore, a reaction mechanism is generated on the basis of major reactions classes in the pyrolysis and feed compounds using some simplification assumptions in the model. This semi-mechanistic kinetic model contains 172 reactions, 22 molecular and 29 radical species. A sensitivity analysis was done on kinetic model and controlling reactions identified. An objective function was defined and used to tune the model with experimental data. Finally, the calculated model results were compared with the experimental data. Scatter diagrams showed good agreement between model and experimental data.
