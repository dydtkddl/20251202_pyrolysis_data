Microwave assisted steam - CO2 char gasification of oil palm shell CO2 gasification of biomass is a promising candidate for the reduction of carbon footprint with the added benefit of improving syngas quality by eliminating N2 dilution. Further enhancement of syngas quality is proposed in this study by incorporating the water shift reaction to increase H2 concentration. Oil palm shell (OPS) as one of the major agriculture waste sources in Malaysia was investigated. Microwave assisted steam-CO2 gasification was characterized in the temperature range of 700–850 °C and steam/CO2 ratio in the range of 0.014–0.043. Surface composition and morphology of char were examined at different temperatures using scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS). Optimum operation was achieved at steam/CO2 ratio of 0.028 and 850 °C with 92% and 85% CO2 and char conversions, respectively. Increasing steam flow at maximum temperature increased the H2/CO ratio by 22% and syngas heating value by 6%. Statement of novelty The effect of steam addition on Boudouard reaction and active sites on oil palm shell char micro-pore-structure, absorption of microwave irradiation and CO2-syngas conversion were characterized.
