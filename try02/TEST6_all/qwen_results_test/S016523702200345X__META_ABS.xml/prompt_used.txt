You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of one-pot H3PO4-activated hydrochar synthesis by Doehlert design: Characterization and application In this work, the hydrochar process optimization was carried out from Brewer’s spent grains (BSG) using wet pyrolysis (WP) with one-pot acid activation. The Doehlert Matrix was used as an experimental design to evaluate the influence of temperature (100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 °C) and residence time (4, 14, and 24 h), totaling nine experiments. The responses to evaluate the synthesis performance were mass yield and methylene blue (MB) dye removal capacity in an aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of each material were determined. The optimized hydrochar (150 °C, 14 h) presented a specific surface area of 9 m² g−1. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model best fit the experimental data of MB removal by hydrochar. In the isotherm study, the amount of MB adsorbed at equilibrium varied from 39.39 to 107.66 mg g−1 for initial concentrations of 50–250 mg L−1, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 134.78 mg g−1, estimated by the Langmuir model. These results were obtained using 1.00 g L−1 of biochar at 30 °C and pH = 6. Finally, it can be concluded that WP with activation in a single step proved to be a suitable way to treat BSG, whose obtained material has a high potential to be used as a low-cost adsorbent for remediating organic pollutants in water.
