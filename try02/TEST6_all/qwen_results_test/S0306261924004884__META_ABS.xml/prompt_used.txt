You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dynamic evolution of terahertz permittivity of lignite during oxidation: Microstructural insights Terahertz technology holds promise for monitoring coal fires and assessing associated risks, relying on the dielectric response of coal during the oxidation process. Besides, unraveling the response mechanism is crucial for enhancing the application's reliability. In light of these, this study focused on investigating the terahertz complex permittivity of lignite with different oxidation temperatures through microstructure analysis. Results indicated that oxidation temperature dependencies in the real and imaginary parts of lignite's permittivity, exhibiting a pattern of initial decrease followed by an increase. The decrease in permittivity during the dehydration and weight loss stage is primarily attributed to moisture content. In the oxygen absorption and weight gain stage, pore development and scattering effects contribute to the continuous decrease in real permittivity and rise in imaginary permittivity. During the oxidative decomposition stage, the hydroxyl group initiates an increased real permittivity. Upon reaching the combustion temperature, there is a sudden surge in permittivity, driven by the dominance of minerals in coal dielectric properties. The conclusions offer theoretical support for terahertz technology in monitoring coal fires, which can contribute to the sustainable development of the coal industry, mineral processing, and safety production.
