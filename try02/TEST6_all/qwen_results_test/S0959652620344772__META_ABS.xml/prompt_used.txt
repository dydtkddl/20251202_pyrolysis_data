You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Eco-friendly strategy to a dual-2D graphene-derived complex for poly (lactic acid) with exceptional smoke suppression and low CO2 production Poly (Lactic acid) (PLA) as a biodegradable biopolymer is remarkably limited for the engineering applications due to its inherent flammability and brittleness. The conventional polymer toughener and flame retardants severely damaged the environment-friendliness and sustainability of PLA. Particularly, the carbon dioxide (CO2) production from the combustion of PLA composites can easily induce the global warming. In this work, a viable strategy was developed to engineer a dual two-dimension (2D) graphene-derived complex as an effective environment-benign flame retardant and interface modifier for PLA materials. Graphene oxide was first functionalized with sustainable long-chain polyester as a multitasking modifier of flame retardant and interfacial compatibilizer. The 2D layered double hydroxide (LDH) was successfully anchored with polyester-functionalized graphene (PG) as a predefined carbonization-catalyzed promoter. The favorable distribution of the dual 2D LDH-anchored PG negated the poor dispersion of high loading LDH, providing PLA matrices with desirable toughness and engineered functional features. The experimental results revealed that the dual 2D graphene-derived complex could enhance flame retardancy with the heat release rate decreased 50% and 29% for poly(propylidene carbonate)-modified and polybutylene succinate-modified composites. The smoke production rate, total smoke production and CO2 production rate of PLA binary composites were also reduced significantly, which could benefit the environment protection. The developed strategy of eco-friendly dual 2D graphene-derived flame retardant not only provided a new insight into modifying the brittle polymer matrices for the functional exploration but also a cleaner process for biodegradable composites with exceptional smoke suppression and reduced carbon dioxide emission.
