Functionalization of carbon nanotubes for enhanced dispersion and improved properties of geopolymer concrete: A review Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have significant potential as reinforcing material in geopolymer concrete (GPC) due to their exceptional chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties. However, the integration of the CNT into GPC is still in its early stages, with uncertainties surrounding mechanisms, diffusion behavior, and overall effectiveness of the CNT in GPC. Achieving superior mechanical properties relies on the proper dispersion of raw aggregated CNTs. This review article explores various dispersion techniques of the CNT in geopolymer concrete, including mechanical methods such as ultrasonication, ball milling, stirring, and milling, as well as physical and chemical functionalization methods. The impact of these techniques on the performance of geopolymer concrete is also discussed, along with the phase and microstructural changes observed in GPC, incorporating both pristine and functionalized CNTs. The findings indicate that effective dispersion techniques can significantly enhance the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete.
