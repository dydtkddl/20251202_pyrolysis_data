Effect of fluidization/gasification parameters on hydrogen generation in syngas during fluidized-bed gasification process This study discusses the influence of fluidization and gasification parameters on the hydrogen composition in syngas. For gasification conditions, when Stage 1 and Stage 2 gasifier temperature is 900 °C, the hydrogen content in syngas is 35.59 mol.% when the activated carbon is used as bed material. For using zeolite as bed material, the hydrogen content is 38.25 mol.%. The hydrogen content is higher than that under other conditions, but if the Steam/Biomass ratio is increased to 0.6, the hydrogen content resulted from zeolite as bed material is the highest 39.38 mol.%. For fluidization parameters, when Stage 2 bed material size is changed to 0.46 mm, no matter the bed material is activated carbon or zeolite, the hydrogen content in syngas is the best among three particle sizes. In terms of operating gas velocity, when gas velocity is 1.5 Umf, the hydrogen content is higher. For fluidization parameters, the two bed materials can increase hydrogen content in syngas effectively in Stage 2 fluidized bed, and their effects are similar to each other. However, considering the fluidization parameters, the hydrogen content in syngas when activated carbon is used as bed material is better than that when the zeolite is used.
