You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of fluidization/gasification parameters on hydrogen generation in syngas during fluidized-bed gasification process This study discusses the influence of fluidization and gasification parameters on the hydrogen composition in syngas. For gasification conditions, when Stage 1 and Stage 2 gasifier temperature is 900 °C, the hydrogen content in syngas is 35.59 mol.% when the activated carbon is used as bed material. For using zeolite as bed material, the hydrogen content is 38.25 mol.%. The hydrogen content is higher than that under other conditions, but if the Steam/Biomass ratio is increased to 0.6, the hydrogen content resulted from zeolite as bed material is the highest 39.38 mol.%. For fluidization parameters, when Stage 2 bed material size is changed to 0.46 mm, no matter the bed material is activated carbon or zeolite, the hydrogen content in syngas is the best among three particle sizes. In terms of operating gas velocity, when gas velocity is 1.5 Umf, the hydrogen content is higher. For fluidization parameters, the two bed materials can increase hydrogen content in syngas effectively in Stage 2 fluidized bed, and their effects are similar to each other. However, considering the fluidization parameters, the hydrogen content in syngas when activated carbon is used as bed material is better than that when the zeolite is used.
