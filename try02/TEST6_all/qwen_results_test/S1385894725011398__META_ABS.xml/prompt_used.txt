You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient removal of perfluorooctanoic acid using synergy of cold Plasma, Sulfate Radicals, and Boron-Doped Graphene-Like Carbon: Insights into synergistic effects and degradation mechanism Advanced oxidation process warrants sustainable processes that can efficiently eliminate organic contaminants from water reservoirs. This study is the first to explore the synergistic effects of cold plasma, persulfate (PS), and boron-doped graphene-like carbon (BDGLC). Plasma activates PS to SO4 •- along with the production of O3 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). For the first time, BDGLC was introduced to plasma + PS system to effectively degrade O3 from the plasma and convert it into more reactive •OH and also to activate PS to SO4 •-. A novel customized plasma reactor was set up to generate high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This novel approach is utilized for the efficient degradation of highly stable and persistent organic pollutants viz. perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The synergy of plasma + PS + BDGLC facilitated 100 % degradation of PFOA within 15 min. The synergy factor of the plasma + PS + BDGLC system was determined to be 1.136, and the value of energy yield ( η deg ) was 1440.3 mgkW−1h−1. Density function theory calculations, scavenger analyses, and LC-MS analyses revealed the degradation mechanism and ROS involved in the degradation of PFOA. The applicability of the proposed method for the efficient degradation of PFOA in wastewater treatment was validated via actual wastewater studies. This study shows an improved degradation efficiency of PFOA within a shorter period of time and in a higher volume of pollutant solution, with an improved energy utilization efficiency. This research reveals a promising approach for the efficient degradation of highly stable and persistent micropollutants in wastewater in an economic and sustainable manner.
