You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of polymer waste into high-value products for advancing circular economy and eco-sustainability Global demands for more effective plastic waste management have driven significant advancements in recycling technologies, yet many of these approaches continue to face considerable economic and technical limitations. As a game-changing concept, upcycling builds on the inherent value of plastic waste by transforming it into specialized, high-value commodities with clear environmental and economic benefits. A key priority lies in addressing the degradation of non-recoverable plastic waste to mitigate persistent pollution concerns. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of emerging plastic conversion technologies, accentuating the transition from conventional recycling to innovative upcycling methods designed to produce premium fuels, chemicals, and materials. In particular, recent breakthroughs in catalytic degradation are examined, detailing the transformation of plastics into biodegradable or environmentally non-toxic products and, in some cases, the complete combustion of polymers into carbon dioxide and water. Emphasizing advanced technologies that go beyond established recycling paradigms, the review underscores upcycling’s potential to address the escalating plastic waste crisis. Further, this discussion investigates how circular economy principles–specifically the reduction, reuse and redesign of plastic productscan reshape the plastic lifecycle and yield superior environmental outcomes. Collaborative initiatives among industry, academia, and policymakers, aimed at driving the field of plastic conversion in new directions, are evaluated. Multiple case studies and pilot projects demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of these cutting-edge approaches in real-world contexts. Finally, the review identifies critical barriers to widespread implementation of advanced plastic conversion technologies and proposes strategic measures to refine upcycling methods. Taken together, these insights call for the global integration of next-generation plastic conversion practices, thereby strengthening environmental sustainability and driving the transition toward a more circular plastic economy.
