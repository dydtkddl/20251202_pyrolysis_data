Catalytic conversion of polymer waste into high-value products for advancing circular economy and eco-sustainability Global demands for more effective plastic waste management have driven significant advancements in recycling technologies, yet many of these approaches continue to face considerable economic and technical limitations. As a game-changing concept, upcycling builds on the inherent value of plastic waste by transforming it into specialized, high-value commodities with clear environmental and economic benefits. A key priority lies in addressing the degradation of non-recoverable plastic waste to mitigate persistent pollution concerns. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of emerging plastic conversion technologies, accentuating the transition from conventional recycling to innovative upcycling methods designed to produce premium fuels, chemicals, and materials. In particular, recent breakthroughs in catalytic degradation are examined, detailing the transformation of plastics into biodegradable or environmentally non-toxic products and, in some cases, the complete combustion of polymers into carbon dioxide and water. Emphasizing advanced technologies that go beyond established recycling paradigms, the review underscores upcycling’s potential to address the escalating plastic waste crisis. Further, this discussion investigates how circular economy principles–specifically the reduction, reuse and redesign of plastic productscan reshape the plastic lifecycle and yield superior environmental outcomes. Collaborative initiatives among industry, academia, and policymakers, aimed at driving the field of plastic conversion in new directions, are evaluated. Multiple case studies and pilot projects demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of these cutting-edge approaches in real-world contexts. Finally, the review identifies critical barriers to widespread implementation of advanced plastic conversion technologies and proposes strategic measures to refine upcycling methods. Taken together, these insights call for the global integration of next-generation plastic conversion practices, thereby strengthening environmental sustainability and driving the transition toward a more circular plastic economy.
