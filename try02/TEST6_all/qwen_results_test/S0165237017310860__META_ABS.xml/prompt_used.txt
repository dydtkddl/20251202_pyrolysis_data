You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of the thermal behavior, kinetics, and product characterization of biomass and low-density polyethylene co-pyrolysis by thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis-GC/MS The present study aims to improve the yields and selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass by the addition of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which has a higher hydrogen-carbon ratio than biomass. We have investigated the thermal decomposition behavior and kinetics, as well as the product distribution, of the co-pyrolysis of biomass (cellulose and pine sawdust) and plastic (LDPE) both with and without a catalyst (HZSM-5) using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Our results, based on the weight loss difference (△W), show that there is a positive and synergistic interaction between the biomass and LDPE. After the addition of LDPE, the synergistic reactions inhibited catalyst coking effectively and decreased the formation of solid residues. In addition, the ZSM-5 catalyst improved the reaction activity and reduced the activation energy, although the reaction mechanism is not changed. At the same time, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method was used to fit the kinetic data for both non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE, and the activation energies (E a) of the cellulose + LDPE + catalyst and pine + LDPE + catalyst systems were found to be 168.81 and 185.87 kJ/mol, respectively. The co-pyrolysis of biomass and LDPE effectively improved the yield and selectivity of aromatics and increased the selectivity for benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene (BTXE). The addition of LDPE can effectively improve the selectivity for naphthalene family products (methylnaphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) in the catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and decrease the content of aromatic hydrocarbons larger than C10.
