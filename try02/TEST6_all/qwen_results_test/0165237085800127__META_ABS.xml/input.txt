Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-photoionization-mass spectrometry, a new approach in the analysis of macromolecular materials A Curie-point evaporation/pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) instrument is described in which a fused-silica capillary column is coupled directly both to the pyrolysis unit and to the ion source of a photoionization mass spectrometer. Photoionization by means of a rare gas resonance lamp was used as the low-energy ionization technique. The performance of the instrument was tested with a Grob test mixture at photoionization energies of 11.8 eV (Ar I) and 10.6 eV (Kr I). Photoionization mass spectra of 1-octanol, methyl octanoate, dimethylaniline and n-dodecane obtained at these energies are discussed. Py-GC-photoionization-mass spectrometry (PIMS) and PIMS data for the (1 → 4)-α-glucan amylose are presented and compared with electron impact (EI) Py-GC-MS and Py-MS results. The cumulative Ar I photoionization mass spectrum of the GC-MS data on amylose closely resembles the 14-eV EI spectrum of amylose. The method is a promising alternative to the existing low-voltage EI ionization mass spectrometry for the pyrolysis analysis of macromolecular materials.
