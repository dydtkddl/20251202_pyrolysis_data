CFD-DDPM modeling of chlorine-rich medical plastic waste in 2D downdraft gasification Medical plastic waste (MPW) from hospitals largely consists of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP), which makes it both a hazardous chlorine source and a potential energy feedstock. While PVC and PP have been studied separately, the coupled transport and reaction dynamics governing chlorine release during gasification are not well understood. Here we developed a two–dimensional CFD-Dense Discrete Phase Model (DDPM) model to simulate downdraft gasification of a 50:50 MPW blend in a lab–scale reactor of 0.2 m diameter, 0.55 m height. The model combines Lagrangian tracking of plastic particles and sand with Eulerian gas–phase hydrodynamics, RNG k–ε turbulence closure and detailed kinetics for devolatilisation, char–gas reactions, steam/dry reforming, water–gas shift and complete conversion of chlorine to HCl. Under steam gasification, quasi–steady operation was achieved within 10 s at 1000 K (±50 K) a temperature range consistent with real downdraft gasifiers producing a dry syngas of about 59 % H2, 18 % CO, 21 % CO2 and 1200 K) temperatures.
