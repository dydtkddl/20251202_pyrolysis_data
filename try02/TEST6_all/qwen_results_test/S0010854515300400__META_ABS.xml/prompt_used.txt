You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal nanoparticles supported on two-dimensional graphenes as heterogeneous catalysts The catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) is highly dependent on the nature of the support. In addition to the role of particle size stabilization in decreasing the spontaneous growth of small MNPs, the main role of the support is to cooperate by providing efficient pathways that lead to the target product. Thus, the necessary requirements for supports include a large surface area, strong metal–support interaction, and the presence of active sites that participate in the reaction mechanism. Active carbons as well as organic polymers and large surface area inorganic metal oxides are typical insoluble solids that are used frequently as supports. Furthermore, the recent availability of suspensions of graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO, and other graphene-based materials (Gs) has provided new opportunities for the development of supported MNPs as catalysts. As supports, Gs combine several useful properties that are not encountered in classical solid supports. Gs comprise sheets that are a single carbon atom in thickness, which approaches the physical limit for a two-dimensional (2D) surface in which MNPs can be deposited. Therefore, Gs are among the solids with the highest possible surface area and due to their single layer morphology, they are readily dispersed in a liquid phase with the appearance of homogeneous catalyst, but they are easily recovered by filtration or centrifugation. In addition, Gs may cooperate with the catalytic cycle involving MNPs in at least four distinctive ways: (i) by strong adsorption of the substrates and reagents near the MNP; (ii) via d–π metal support interaction, which influences the electron density of the MNP; (iii) promoting substrate reactivity by giving or withdrawing the electron density from the substrate; and (iv) by making specific catalytic sites available on the G nanosheet due to defects, oxygenated functional groups, or the presence of dopants. This review highlights the specific features derived from the morphology and characteristics of Gs, as well as the different catalytic behaviors of G-supported MNPs compared with related catalysts. One of the aims of this review is to provide a reference to indicate best practices as well as suggesting benchmark reactions to evaluate the catalytic activity of different materials. Considering the growth in the use of G as supports and the unique features obtained by employing 2D Gs as supports for MNPs, the present review has implications in the fields of catalysis, biocatalysis, and material science.
