You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling sludge-derived hydrochar to facilitate advanced denitrification of secondary effluent: Role of extracellular electron transfer Sludge-derived hydrochar (SDHC) was recycled to enhance the denitrification of secondary effluent. Under different carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios, the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) and carbon source efficiency (CSE) of denitrification coupled with SDHC (DN-SDHC) were distinctly higher than that of denitrification alone (DN). Moreover, at the C/N ratios of 3.0–3.2 and 5.8–5.9, the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of DN-SDHC was 3.6- and 1.5-fold that of DN, respectively. The characterization of SDHC before and after used in denitrification indicated that the metal ions and functional groups did not participate in denitrification. Although SDHC has no redox capacity to donate electron for denitrification, its higher conductivity enabled the acceleration of extracellular electron transfer from carbon source to denitrifiers. The abundance of denitrifying community and functional genes was synchronously promoted by SDHC. Especially, the significant increase of nosZ gene encoding nitrous oxide reductase was conducive to mitigating the emission of N2O greenhouse gas.
