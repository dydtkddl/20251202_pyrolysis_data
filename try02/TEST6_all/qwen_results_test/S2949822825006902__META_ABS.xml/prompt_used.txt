You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the formation, recovery, and properties of coal fly ash (CFA)-derived microspheres for sustainable technologies and biomedical applications Coal fly ash (CFA), a by-product of coal combustion in thermal power plant (TPP), is an environmental concern due to its massive production and improper disposal. Among its components, microspheres like cenospheres (CS), plerospheres (PS), and ferrospheres (FS) hold significant industrial value. CS are lightweight, hollow particles with unique properties such as low density, high mechanical strength, and thermal stability, making them suitable for composites, ceramics, and insulation. PS, with their porous structures, are useful in construction and ceramics, while FS, rich in iron, are applied in catalysis and magnetic materials. Additionally, CFA-derived microspheres, such as CS and FS, exhibit promising potential in biomedical applications due to their unique structural and chemical features. Their suitability for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostic tools highlights their emerging role in sustainable healthcare solutions. This review focuses on the formation, recovery, and properties of these microspheres, highlighting their sustainable applications in lightweight composites, environmental clean-up, and advanced materials. Various recovery methods, including wet and dry techniques, are discussed to optimize extraction processes. The study emphasizes the potential of these microspheres in reducing CFA waste while supporting innovative and eco-friendly technologies. This work contributes to developing sustainable solutions for managing CFA, with the goal of reducing environmental impacts and enhancing industrial utility, particularly in sustainable and biomedical applications.
