You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advancements in synthesis and applications of covalent organic frameworks Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) represent a groundbreaking class of porous, crystalline materials composed of light elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and boron. These materials exhibit low density, high stability, a large specific surface area, and tunable pore structures, making them highly versatile for various applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the synthesis, properties, and applications of COFs. Innovative synthesis methods, including solvothermal, microwave-assisted, mechanochemical, and ionothermal techniques, enable precise control over the structural and functional properties of COFs. The influence of different linkage types, such as imine, boronate ester, triazine, and carbonyl, on the properties and functionalities of COFs is explored. Additionally, modification strategies, including functional group introduction and metal incorporation, enhance the versatility and range of applications for COFs. The diverse applications of COFs in gas storage, energy storage, water pollutant removal, drug delivery, food safety analysis, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronics are discussed. Challenges in COF synthesis, characterization, and application and future perspectives on developing COF-based materials for advanced technological and environmental applications are addressed. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers working in the field of porous materials and their applications.
