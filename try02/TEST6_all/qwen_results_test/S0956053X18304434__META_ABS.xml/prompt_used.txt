You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of a wood-plastic composite with metal oxides as catalysts The catalytic fast pyrolysis of a poplar wood-polypropylene composite (WPP) was investigated using Py-GC/MS in the presence of ZnO, CaO, Fe2O3 and MgO. The synergistic effects between wood and plastic components in both non-catalytic and ZnO-catalyzed pyrolysis of WPP were studied. CaO facilitated the removal of oxygen due to its strong basicity, eliminating carboxylic acids and phenols from the products, while slightly increasing cyclopentanones and alkenes. MgO has weaker deoxygenation but stronger chain scission activities versus CaO, and significantly enhanced the alkene yields. Alkene yields were highest using ZnO among the four catalysts. ZnO increased ketone and phenol yields while reducing carboxylic acids. Aromatics were identified in the presence of Fe2O3. A synergistic effect between poplar wood and PP in the uncatalyzed pyrolysis of WPP increased the yields of carboxylic acids, phenols and light alkenes, while it reduced carbonyl-containing oxygenates such as aldehydes, ketones and furans. The synergy in the ZnO-catalyzed pyrolysis of WPP further enhanced the formation of monomeric phenols and alkenes.
