You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gasification feasibility of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene waste and their mixture: Experimental studies and modeling Plastic waste is on the rise and continues to enter in every consumer product. Their recycling, however poses challenges due to their compositions and inhomogeneity. Gasification is an energy conversion route of hydrocarbon and is a well-developed technology for coal, but not for municipal-solid-waste (MSW) derivatives (plastic/tires/wood). Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) holds about 12% of our daily MSW fraction and are characterized with high calorific value (~40 MJ/kg). In this work, TGA/DSC analysis was firstly done for sample plastic waste to capture their degradation kinetics needed for successful gasification. These parameters were evaluated using Arrhenius and Coat-Redfern methods. The best-fitted-values were implemented in a high-fidelity entrained-flow-gasification model for comparative analysis. Gasification was conducted based on the drop-tube-reactor (0.066 m diameter & 1.54 m length) with an equivalence ratio of 1.8. Wall temperature was fixed at 1000 °C under atmospheric pressure. Activation energy results for PE, PP, PS and their mixture are 340, 220, 320 and 85 kJ/mol, respectively and rate constants vary between E10 to E22 min−1. Air gasification results in efficiencies of 59.03%, 62.73%, and 73.13% for PE, PP, and PS, respectively. Their co-gasification reached 89% due to lower activation-energy which emphasized their usage as mixture and saves their segregation.
