Saccharide mapping as an extraordinary method on characterization and identification of plant and fungi polysaccharides: A review Saccharide mapping was a promising scheme to unveil the mystery of polysaccharide structure by analysis of the fragments generated from polysaccharide decomposition process. However, saccharide mapping was not widely applied in the polysaccharide analysis for lacking of systematic introduction. In this review, a detailed description of the establishment process of saccharide mapping, the pros and cons of downstream technologies, an overview of the application of saccharide mapping, and practical strategies were summarized. With the updating of the available downstream technologies, saccharide mapping had been expanding its scope of application to various kinds of polysaccharides. The process of saccharide mapping analysis included polysaccharides degradation and hydrolysates analysis, and the degradation process was no longer limited to acid hydrolysis. Some downstream technologies were convenient for rapid qualitative analysis, while others could achieve quantitative analysis. For the more detailed structure information could be provided by saccharide mapping, it was possible to improve the quality control of polysaccharides during preparation and application. This review filled the blank of basic information about saccharide mapping and was helpful for the establishment of a professional workflow for the saccharide mapping application to promote the deep study of polysaccharide structure.
