You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Saccharide mapping as an extraordinary method on characterization and identification of plant and fungi polysaccharides: A review Saccharide mapping was a promising scheme to unveil the mystery of polysaccharide structure by analysis of the fragments generated from polysaccharide decomposition process. However, saccharide mapping was not widely applied in the polysaccharide analysis for lacking of systematic introduction. In this review, a detailed description of the establishment process of saccharide mapping, the pros and cons of downstream technologies, an overview of the application of saccharide mapping, and practical strategies were summarized. With the updating of the available downstream technologies, saccharide mapping had been expanding its scope of application to various kinds of polysaccharides. The process of saccharide mapping analysis included polysaccharides degradation and hydrolysates analysis, and the degradation process was no longer limited to acid hydrolysis. Some downstream technologies were convenient for rapid qualitative analysis, while others could achieve quantitative analysis. For the more detailed structure information could be provided by saccharide mapping, it was possible to improve the quality control of polysaccharides during preparation and application. This review filled the blank of basic information about saccharide mapping and was helpful for the establishment of a professional workflow for the saccharide mapping application to promote the deep study of polysaccharide structure.
