You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Diesel steam reforming: Comparison of two nickel aluminate catalysts prepared by wet-impregnation and co-precipitation γ-Al2O3 supported Ni–Al spinel catalysts, prepared by co-precipitation and wet impregnation, were produced, analysed and tested on commercial diesel steam reforming. The study of the preparation method's effect on the catalytic activity, builds on a previously patented Ni–Al spinel (NiAl2O4) catalyst supported on alumina (Al2O3) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). This non-noble metal-based NiAl2O4/Al2O3–YSZ catalyst demonstrated high activity for commercial diesel and biodiesel steam reforming. Diesel steam reforming experiments were performed in a fixed-bed reactor setup, with a proprietary diesel–water emulsion mixture at 760°C. The two tested catalytic formulations yielded the same overall conversion while the products obtained were significantly different. Thus, the catalyst produced via the co-precipitation method (Copr) (a) suffered rapid deactivation from carbon deposition; (b) produced 5 times more methane than the catalyst produced via the wet impregnation method (Impr) and (c) showed a decreasing hydrogen production. The Impr catalyst exhibited a higher stability for diesel steam reforming with no signs of carbon formation or activity loss. The difference between Impr and Copr catalyst activities is related to the Ni-aluminates dispersion: located on the surface for the Impr catalyst, whereas located in the bulk of the Copr catalyst. In order to correlate their activities to their physicochemical properties, both new catalytic formulations presented in this work were characterized before and after steam reforming tests, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as temperature programmed reduction (TPR).
