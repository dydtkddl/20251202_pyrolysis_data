You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalyst metal-ligand design for rapid, selective, and solventless depolymerization of Nylon-6 plastics Developing effective catalysis to address end-of-life Nylon pollution is urgent yet remains underdeveloped. Nylon-6 is a resilient synthetic plastic and a major contributor to ocean pollution. Here, we report a metallocene catalytic system based on earth-abundant early transition and lanthanide metals that mediates Nylon-6 depolymerization at unprecedented rates up to 810 (ε-caprolactam)·mol(Cat.)−1·h−1 at 240°C in ≥99% yield. This solventless process operates with catalyst loadings as low as 0.04 mol % at temperatures as low as 220°C—the mildest Nylon-6 depolymerization conditions reported to date. This metallocene catalysis can be carried out in a simulated continuous process, and the resulting ε-caprolactam can be re-polymerized to higher-quality Nylon-6. Experimental and DFT analyses identify effective depolymerization pathways involving catalytic intra-Nylon-chain “unzipping” assisted by π-ligand effects and inter-chain “hopping.” A robust chelating ansa-yttrocene is particularly effective in depolymerizing diverse commodity end-of-life articles, such as fishing nets, carpets, clothing, and plastic mixtures.
