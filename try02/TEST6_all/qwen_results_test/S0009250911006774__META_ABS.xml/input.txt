Three-dimensional numerical modelling of interactions between a gas–liquid jet and a fluidized bed This paper presents the development of a novel mathematical model that describes spray injection and spreading into a fluidized bed of solid particles. The model also includes the gas–liquid flow through the nozzle followed by the gas-assisted atomization. An Eulerian approach that is independent of the nature of the continuous phase is adopted for all phases, which are gas (or bubbles), liquid (or droplets), and solid particles that may be covered with a liquid layer. Variation in sizes of bubbles and droplets is represented by the particle number density approach that takes into account both break-up and coalescence. The atomization is considered as a catastrophic phase inversion triggered by a critical local volume fraction. New relationships were obtained for liquid spreading due to wet particle collisions and for heat conduction between a solid particle and a surrounding liquid layer. The model is applied to simulate liquid injection into the fluidized bed for conditions that were previously experimentally studied and published. The comparison reveals a reasonable agreement in prediction of the cumulative liquid distribution for two experimental cases. In addition, we evaluated a jet penetration distance with the model to compare it with the one measured in another set of experiments. This comparison also yields a good qualitative agreement. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the fluidization velocity on liquid distribution in the bed.
