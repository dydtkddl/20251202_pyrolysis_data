You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Using recycled tetrapak and Ag/BaMoO4 nanoparticles to make efficient and flexible solid state supercapacitors Recycling materials containing plastics is of environmental interests because they are finally released in the oceans and rivers, producing contamination by microplastics suspended in the water. To palliate this problem, we fabricated supercapacitors (SCs) using recycled tetrapak/graphene as flexible electrode and the Ag/BaMoO4 (BAMO) NPs as the redox material. Those NPs had a rhombohedral morphology, average size of 655 nm and tetragonal structure according to the analysis by SEM and XRD. Solid state SCs were constructed using these electrodes and obtained a maximum capacitance and energy density values of 233 F g−1 and 88 Wh kg−1, respectively. When these SCs are made with BAMO NPs on their electrodes, the capacitance and energy density are increased up to 443 F g−1 and 173 Wh kg−1, respectively. The capacitance retention was calculated for the SC made with and without BAMO NPs after 500 cycles of charge/discharge, and obtained values of 92% and 83%, respectively. The higher capacitance retention obtained in the SCs made with BAMO NPs indicates that such nanomaterial improves their electrochemical stability. Surprisingly, the SCs made with BAMO NPs presented a stable output voltage of 0.93 V after 8 h of continuous discharge, which has not been previously observed in SCs made with recycled materials. Moreover, the absorbance, Raman and XPS measurements confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancies and species such as Ba2+/Ba+, Mo6+/Mo5+ and Ag2+/Ag+/Ag0 in the tetrapak/graphene electrodes containing BAMO, which acted as redox centers for the charge storage. Hence, this research demonstrated that efficient SCs can be fabricated utilizing recycled tetrapack. Using this “waste” material could be useful to decrease the cost of the current supercapacitors and would reduce the contamination by plastics in the environment (the tretapak contains 24% of plastic).
