You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance analysis of crude terephthalic acid hydropurification in an industrial trickle-bed reactor experiencing catalyst deactivation In this work, a dynamic model of an industrial trickle-bed reactor for hydrogenation reactions of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde has been developed. In this case, a heterogeneous plug-flow model has been considered to predict the dynamic behavior of the catalytic hydropurification reactor of Purified Terephthalic Acid production plant. Furthermore, deactivation model of carbon coated palladium catalyst of the reactor (0.5wt.% Pd/C, type D3065, supplied by Chimet SpA) has been devised based on the actual plant data. The catalyst of the proposed industrial reactor is deactivated after 360days. The simulation results indicate that the concentration of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde is very influential. In addition, concentration of para-toluic is not as destructive as that of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde so that it lessens the lifetime of catalyst about 40days if its concentration in normal operation builds up more than 1.6 times. Besides, the concentration of reactor feed should not be increased to boost the rate of production since this makes the lifetime of the catalyst shorter. If the production rate enhances about 18%, the lifetime of the catalyst drops more than 6months. The hydropurification reactor control is the most crucial part of the purification unit operation. Thus, in addition to the reactor operation assessment, this dynamic model can be used to evaluate the purification section performance at any time to continue producing on-spec product. Also, it might be used in future in the formulation of model based control strategies for the reactor control.
