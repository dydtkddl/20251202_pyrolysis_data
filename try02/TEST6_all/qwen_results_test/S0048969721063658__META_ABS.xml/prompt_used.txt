You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behavior of low-density polyethylene over HZSM-5 via rapid infrared heating Catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over HZSM-5 were carried out by using infrared heating technology. The effects of heating rate (1–30 °C/s), pyrolysis temperature (450–650 °C), and mass ratio of catalyst to LDPE (0:100 to 50:100) on product distribution and oil composition in LDPE pyrolysis were investigated, and the fast pyrolysis mechanism was explored. The results indicated that a higher heating rate, namely 20 °C/s, can remarkably enhance the liquid oil yield (93.42%), but the oil is heavy due to about 90% high‑carbon n-aliphatics. The addition of HZSM-5 performed an excellent effect on obtaining high-quality liquid oils, among which the total content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and iso-aliphatics obviously increase from 0.68% to 70.26%. The optimal HZSM-5/LDPE ratio of 10:100 was identified by considering the cost-effective factor. Furthermore, the lower catalytic temperature is favorable to the generation of light oil components, especially MAHs. The feasible generation paths were proposed, which mainly derived from the secondary reaction of the intermediate formed by initial chain cleavage including cyclization, aromatization, Diels-Alder reaction, as well as isomerization.
