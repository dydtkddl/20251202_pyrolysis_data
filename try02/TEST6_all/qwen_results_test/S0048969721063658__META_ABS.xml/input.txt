Pyrolysis behavior of low-density polyethylene over HZSM-5 via rapid infrared heating Catalytic fast pyrolysis experiments of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over HZSM-5 were carried out by using infrared heating technology. The effects of heating rate (1–30 °C/s), pyrolysis temperature (450–650 °C), and mass ratio of catalyst to LDPE (0:100 to 50:100) on product distribution and oil composition in LDPE pyrolysis were investigated, and the fast pyrolysis mechanism was explored. The results indicated that a higher heating rate, namely 20 °C/s, can remarkably enhance the liquid oil yield (93.42%), but the oil is heavy due to about 90% high‑carbon n-aliphatics. The addition of HZSM-5 performed an excellent effect on obtaining high-quality liquid oils, among which the total content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and iso-aliphatics obviously increase from 0.68% to 70.26%. The optimal HZSM-5/LDPE ratio of 10:100 was identified by considering the cost-effective factor. Furthermore, the lower catalytic temperature is favorable to the generation of light oil components, especially MAHs. The feasible generation paths were proposed, which mainly derived from the secondary reaction of the intermediate formed by initial chain cleavage including cyclization, aromatization, Diels-Alder reaction, as well as isomerization.
