You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of graphene crystals from solid waste plastic by chemical vapor deposition Here, we report the synthesis of high quality single crystal graphene on polycrystalline Cu foil using solid waste plastic as carbon source in an ambient pressure (AP) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Gas chromatography analysis shows that the waste plastic is rich in polyethylene and polystyrene based polymer components. The growth of individual crystal strongly influenced by the injection rate of decomposed polymeric components generated during pyrolysis of waste plastic. Synthesis of large hexagonal and round shape single crystal graphene are achieved with a controlled rate of pyrolysis for the waste plastic. Raman studies confirm high quality of the graphene crystals independent of hexagonal and round shapes. Again, nucleation of bilayer or few-layer graphene crystals are observed with a higher injection rate of decomposed polymeric components. The evolution of hexagonal graphene crystals synthesized by AP-CVD process from waste plastic can be significant to obtain large single crystal graphene and stacked bi-layer structure. Our findings shows that solid waste plastic can be directly use as a feedstock for high quality graphene growth and thereby converting to a significantly value added product.
