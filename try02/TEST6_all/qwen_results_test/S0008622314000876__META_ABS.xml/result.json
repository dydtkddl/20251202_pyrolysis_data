  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study involves pyrolysis of waste plastic as a carbon source for graphene synthesis, but lacks measurable experimental data on pyrolysis product yields, reactor conditions, or analytical characterization of pyrolysis products, and focuses primarily on graphene growth rather than plastic pyrolysis itself."
