H2 production from lightweight inorganic hydrides catalyzed by 3d transition metals This review is a collective survey of the most recent research on hydrogen production from lightweight inorganic hydrides mediated by 3d metal-containing heterogeneous catalysts, within the broader context of chemical hydrogen storage. The manuscript is divided in paragraphs with respect to the hydride type. Literature examples are limited to 3d metal nanoparticles (NPs; heterogeneously catalyzed thermal dehydrogenation or hydrolysis) deposited on either inorganic or organic supports. The catalysts efficiency (in terms of H2 release temperature, equivalents of H2 produced and relative reaction rates) is provided throughout the discussion.
