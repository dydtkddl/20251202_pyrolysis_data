You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Systematic investigation on combustion characteristics and emission-reduction mechanism of potentially toxic elements in biomass- and biochar-coal co-combustion systems Thermochemically converted biochar is considered as one of the promising alternative solid-fuel due to its high carbon contents of up to 80%, and has great potential to produce environmentally-friendly green-energy by improved fuel properties and emission-reduction of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). In this study, the biochar fuels, produced from peanut shell (PS) and wheat straw (WS) at 300, 500 and 700°C, alone and blended with coal at mass ratio of 20% and 50% were systematically investigated for combustion characteristics and their potential to reduce the emission of PTEs including As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, V and Zn in relation to partitioning, retention and volatilization in the co-combustion systems, using a variety of experimental techniques. Results indicated that the biochar-coal blended fuels in equal proportion showed steady state combustion over broad temperature range resulting increased the combustion efficiency and improved the thermal characteristics in comparison to coal and/or biomass-coal fuels. In addition, soot yield, CO emission and un-burned carbon in fly ash reduced significantly in biochar-blended fuels. However, CO2 emission from biochar-coal co-combustion was comparable to coal and/or biomass-coal fuels. Moreover, the present study illustrated that the volatilization potential of PTEs during combustion of biochar and their blends with coal decreased considerably up to 21% compared to that of coal, and enrichment of these contaminants occurred in the bottom and fly ashes ranged from 15.38–65% and 24.54–74.29%, respectively. Slagging and fouling problems were still found with biochar-coal co-combustion due to the higher inorganic fraction of biochar, which were overcome with the hydrothermal washing of fuels. Thus, it can be concluded that biochar-coal co-combustion is a suitable option for its use in existing coal-fired energy generation system to achieve the sustainable clean-green energy and reduction of gaseous PTEs emission.
