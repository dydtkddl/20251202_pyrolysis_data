A review of the carbon coating of the silicon anode in high-performance lithium-ion batteries In the development of rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs), silicon anodes have attracted much attention because of their extremely high theoretical capacity, relatively low Li-insertion voltage and the availability of silicon resources. However, their large volume expansion and fragile solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film hinder their commercial application. To solve these problems, Si has been combined with various carbon materials to increase their structural stability and improve their interface properties. The use of different carbon materials, such as amorphous carbon and graphite, as three-dimensional (3D) protective anode coatings that help buffer mechanical strain and isolate the electrolyte is detailed, and novel methods for applying the coatings are outlined. However, carbon materials used as a protective layer still have some disadvantages, necessitating their modification. Recent developments have focused on modifying the protective carbon shells, and substitutes for the carbon have been suggested.
