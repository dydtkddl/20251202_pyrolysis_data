You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the regulation of ABS molecular structure for enhancing the interlayer bonding strength and properties of FDM products Interlayer bonding strength (IBS) is the decisive factor governing the performance of fused deposition modeling (FDM) parts. However, limited research has been conducted on regulating the material molecular structure within FDM processes to enhance IBS. In this study, different acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) specimens for FDM were fabricated by strategically modifying the molecular structure of ABS through emulsion grafting polymerization (to control grafted layer thickness) and seed amplification methodology (to achieve a bimodal particle size distribution). The grafted layer thickness of ABS polybutadiene (PB) phase particles, the compatibility between the two phases, the IBS, and the resulting properties of the FDM parts were investigated. The results demonstrate that increasing the grafted layer thickness of the ABS PB phase particles enhances the compatibility between the phases and increases the fluidity of the ABS melt. Consequently, this improves both the diffusion ability and time for molecular chains during the FDM process, thereby further enhancing IBS. Regulating a bimodal distribution of PB phase particle size further increased ABS melt fluidity, leading to additional IBS improvement. The IBS was directly quantified by T-peel tests, revealing an 110.8 % increase from ABS-1 to ABS-3, with ABS-3 exhibiting a 32.2 % higher peel strength (3.12 N/mm) than a commercial ABS. Following IBS enhancement, the impact strength increased by 60.7 % at 25 °C and by 161.5 % at −30 °C, while the tensile strength increased by 55.6 %. The retention rate of low-temperature impact strength increased by 62.6 %. Furthermore, the dimensional stability of the FDM parts demonstrated significant improvement.
