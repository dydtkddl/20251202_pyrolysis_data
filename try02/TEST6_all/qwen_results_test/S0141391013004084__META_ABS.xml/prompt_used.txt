You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of thermal and photochemical degradation strategies on the deterioration of cellulose diacetate In this study, the effect of thermal and photochemical accelerated degradation on the deterioration pathways of cellulose diacetate was evaluated. The degradation induced under controlled experimental conditions was carefully monitored in order to investigate the correlation between specific degradation mechanisms and the visible signs of deterioration that are often encountered on cellulose acetate museum objects. In the time interval studied, thermally degraded samples did not show visible discoloration or noticeable vinegar smell, but appeared severely distorted. Samples degraded under UVA radiation did not show any significant sign of deterioration, while samples degraded under UVB and UVC radiations appeared discolored and released the typical vinegar odor. Samples degraded under UVB radiation were also brittle and prone to crazing. By monitoring the samples as they deteriorated over time, new insights into the degradation mechanisms were obtained. During thermal degradation, the experimental results showed that plasticizer diffusion through the polymer matrix is affected by the progressive loss of plasticizer that occurred during the degradation experiment. During photo-degradation experiments, yellowness induced by UVC and UVB radiations was found to be reversible by subsequent exposure to UVA radiation, while the depth of the degradation appeared to be one of the key factors that led to brittleness and the appearance of crazing.
