You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Construction of continuous flow catalytic reactor-HPLC system with ultrahigh catalytic activity using 2D nanoflower MOF-derived Cu2O/Cu/PDA/CF catalyst Currently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived materials have been widely concerned for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). However, complex recovery of powder catalysts and low utilization ratio of active sites make their application challenging. Herein, a novel Cu2O/Cu/PDA/CF catalyst has been developed for the rapid reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The catalyst was constructed by compositing a two-dimensional nanoflower MOF-derived nanoporous Cu2O/Cu network on a polydopamine (PDA)-modified porous copper foam by a mild and controllable in-situ reduction synthesis. Notably, an enhanced catalytic performance of Cu2O/Cu/PDA/CF was obtained for 4-NP reduction with a rate constant (k) of 0.8001 min−1, outperforming Cu/PDA/CF-X (X = 400, 500 and 600 ℃ pyrolysis temperature) catalysts (2.3–6.4 folds), and even many reported catalysts (2.3–46.5 folds). The ultrafast degradation of 4-NP was completed in 70 s. Moreover, an ingenious online continuous flow catalytic reactor (CFCR)-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system was constructed for automatic and real-time monitoring of the reduction reaction. System stability experiments over 300 min revealed a surprisingly high reaction k value of 76.68 min−1 at low NaBH4 usage, significant increasing by 2–3 orders of magnitude compared with Cu2O/Cu/PDA/CF batch catalysis, due to the high aspect ratio of 2D nanoflower MOF and convection-accelerated mass transfer. This work offers new insights for the rational design of catalytic reactor and its potential application in wastewater treatment.
