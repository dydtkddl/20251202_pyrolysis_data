You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive evaluation of the physicochemical properties and pyrolysis mechanism of products from the slow pyrolysis of waste coffee shells Slow pyrolysis is an efficient method for converting agricultural and forestry wastes into valuable resources, thereby addressing energy shortage and environmental pollution. In this study, a slow-pyrolysis experiment of coffee shells (CS) at 450–850 °C was conducted in a tube furnace. The resulting pyrolysis products were comprehensively characterized via FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption analysis via BET theory, SEM, XPS, and PY-GC-MS. Moreover, the pyrolysis reaction mechanism and N transformation pathway of CS were proposed. The results showed that with the increase in pyrolysis temperature, the yield of biochar gradually decreased, and the yield of biogas gradually increased. At 850 °C, the yields of biochar, bio-oil and biogas of CS were 27.13, 35.16 and 37.71 %, respectively (on a dry, ash-free basis). The bio-oil yield was highest at 550 °C, reaching 35.7 %. Notably, biochar exhibited favorable characteristics such as high specific surface area and porosity, demonstrating its potential as both a biomass fuel and an adsorption material. Acetone (78.30 %) and caffeine (8.29 %) was the predominant substance in bio-oil. Biogas was predominantly composed of CO2, CO, CH4 and H2. The pyrolysis process of CS mainly involved the degradation of macromolecules into small molecules, the repyrolysis of small molecules, dehydrogenation, deoxygenation, alkylation, isomerization, and self-condensation. These results provide a theoretical basis for the recycling of waste biomass CS, which has environmental protection significance and economic value.
