You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Temperature-dependent highly active LaCaMgAl2O4 catalyst effect on carbon nanomaterial and hydrogen generation from polymethyl methacrylate plastic The increasing accumulation of waste polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plastics presents a significant environmental challenge, while the demand for renewable energy sources continues to rise. Thermochemical recycling is a prospective technique for converting waste plastics into high-value chemicals, both economically and environmentally. In this work, the catalytic pyrolysis of waste PMMA plastics over LaCaMgAl2O4 nanosheets (NSs) catalyst is being investigated for its potential to produce hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The yield and purity of the gaseous products, as well as carbon deposition, concerning the effects of temperature during the catalysis process. Additionally, a small portion of LaCa was incorporated into the MgAl2O4 composite in the pre-catalysts under investigation. Analyzing the physicochemical properties of the carbon nanomaterials that form provides valuable insights into the workings of different catalysts. It's noteworthy that LaCaMgAl2O4 NSs showed such large yields of H2 (82.71 vol% H2) and CNTs (388 mg g−1) at 750 °C. The LaCaMgAl2O4 NSs catalyst's impressive ability to produce CNTs and H2 gas at high yields underscores its efficacy and potential for real-world catalytic pyrolysis applications. This study emphasizes the Nanocatalyst's potential for large-scale catalytic pyrolysis operations, providing a workable and efficient way of converting waste plastics into high-value products and renewable energy.
