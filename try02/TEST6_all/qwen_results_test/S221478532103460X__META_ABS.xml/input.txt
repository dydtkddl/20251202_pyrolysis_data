A critical review on the utilization of waste PET and marble dust in the development of composite material Nowadays, industrial wastes are producing lots of environmental pollutions such as soil pollution and air pollution. These wastes also generate various types of diseases after entering into the human body along with air. However, various attempts are made to recycle these wastes. In this study, the utilization of waste PET and marble dust is proposed in the development of composite material. Waste PET also produced soil pollution. Further, marble dust generates air as well as soil pollution. This review article describes a simple and cheap method of manufacturing the composite material with the help of waste PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and marble dust.
