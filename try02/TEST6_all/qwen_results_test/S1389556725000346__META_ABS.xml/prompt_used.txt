You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineering ZnS quantum dots for photocatalysis: Synthesis, modifications, and multifunctional applications Photocatalysis is an advanced technology that efficiently converts solar energy into chemical energy, attracting widespread attention in environmental remediation, energy development, and biomedical applications. ZnS quantum dots (ZnS QDs), as a representative wide-bandgap semiconductor, exhibit unique quantum confinement effects, tunable optoelectronic properties, and a high specific surface area, making them a promising metal sulfide photocatalyst. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in ZnS QD-based photocatalytic systems, with a focus on material design strategies and multifunctional applications. First, the fundamental mechanisms of ZnS QDs in photocatalysis are introduced, followed by a discussion on their synthesis methods. Several strategies for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of ZnS QDs, including surface modification, elemental doping, heterojunction formation, and coupling with carbon or organic materials, are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we comprehensively review the applications of ZnS QDs in the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, water splitting for H2 production, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, antimicrobial activity, and organic synthesis, highlighting their breakthroughs in biomedical field, such as near-infrared-activated antimicrobial systems and tumor-specific photodynamic/photothermal therapy. Finally, by analyzing the current challenges of ZnS QDs in photocatalysis, we propose three future research directions to promote their practical applications in sustainable energy, environmental restoration, and precision medicine.
