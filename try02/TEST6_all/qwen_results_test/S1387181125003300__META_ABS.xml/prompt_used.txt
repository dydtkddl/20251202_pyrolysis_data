You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A thermally stable Cr-doped UiO-66 supported Zn-Cr catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 at low temperature: Catalytic activity and kinetic modeling This research focused on the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (ODHP-CO2) using zinc-promoted chromium nanoparticles supported on Cr-doped UiO-66. A Cr-doped UiO-66 metal-organic framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction, and Cr/UiO-66(Cr) composites with different mass percentages of Cr were developed by the co-precipitation method. In addition, zinc was applied as a promoter by the impregnation method. The characteristics of the synthesized catalysts were determined by XRD, BET, FE-SEM, EDS-dot mapping, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, and TGA. Catalytic performance tests for ODHP-CO2 were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures of 350, 400 and 450 °C, under atmospheric pressure, a C3H8/CO2 molar ratio of 1, and a WHSV ranging from 0.27 to 1.62 h−1. As a result, the 2 %Zn–5 %Cr/UiO-66(Cr) catalyst achieved a propylene selectivity of 75.5 % and a propane conversion of 18.7 % at a temperature of 450 °C, C3H8/CO2 molar ratio of 1, and WHSV of 0.27 h−1 after 8 h of reaction time. Furthermore, kinetic modeling of ODHP-CO2 was also performed, using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism to calculate the kinetic parameters. According to this mechanism, the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 12.34 kJ mol−1.
