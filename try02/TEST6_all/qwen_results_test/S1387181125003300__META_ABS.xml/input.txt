A thermally stable Cr-doped UiO-66 supported Zn-Cr catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 at low temperature: Catalytic activity and kinetic modeling This research focused on the low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (ODHP-CO2) using zinc-promoted chromium nanoparticles supported on Cr-doped UiO-66. A Cr-doped UiO-66 metal-organic framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal reaction, and Cr/UiO-66(Cr) composites with different mass percentages of Cr were developed by the co-precipitation method. In addition, zinc was applied as a promoter by the impregnation method. The characteristics of the synthesized catalysts were determined by XRD, BET, FE-SEM, EDS-dot mapping, FT-IR, NH3-TPD, and TGA. Catalytic performance tests for ODHP-CO2 were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures of 350, 400 and 450 °C, under atmospheric pressure, a C3H8/CO2 molar ratio of 1, and a WHSV ranging from 0.27 to 1.62 h−1. As a result, the 2 %Zn–5 %Cr/UiO-66(Cr) catalyst achieved a propylene selectivity of 75.5 % and a propane conversion of 18.7 % at a temperature of 450 °C, C3H8/CO2 molar ratio of 1, and WHSV of 0.27 h−1 after 8 h of reaction time. Furthermore, kinetic modeling of ODHP-CO2 was also performed, using the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism to calculate the kinetic parameters. According to this mechanism, the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 12.34 kJ mol−1.
