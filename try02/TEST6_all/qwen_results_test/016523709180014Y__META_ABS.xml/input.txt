Thermal cracking of substituted aromatic hydrocarbons. I. Kinetic study of the thermal cracking of i-propylbenzene Experiments on the thermal cracking of i-propylbenzene (cumene) were carried out in a bench scale tubular reactor under conditions as close as possible to those in industrial operations. The experimental unit is described and the results are presented. The free radical reaction network was established. The activation energy and frequency factor for each reaction step in the network were estimated, first by trial and error and then more systematically by a minimization technique. The thermodynamic analysis was conducted for the reversible reactions. This imposed constraints on the Arrhenius parameters. The yields of the products calculated by the kinetic model are in good agreement with the experimental observations.
