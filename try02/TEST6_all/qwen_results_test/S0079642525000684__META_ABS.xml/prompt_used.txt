You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advancements in metal-free nitrides based single-atom catalysts: Nanoarchitectonics and applications Metal-free nitrides (MFNs) including carbon nitride (CN), boron nitride (BN), and borocarbonitride (BCN), have shown immense potential as single metal atom catalysts (SACs). They can act as excellent host support for anchoring and stabilizing single metal atoms. However, critical challenges related to the precise loading of single metal atoms and their accurate characterization are still being pursued. The current review explores the various aspects of MFNs-SACs. Synthesis methods including carbonization, self-assembly, microwave, ball milling and atomic layer deposition are discussed. Characterisation using X-ray absorption, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), Wavelet transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (WT-EXAFS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) which are useful to explore atomic-level structure and coordination of the MFNs-SACs are discussed in depth. The theoretical understanding of the structural framework of the MFNs-SACs using the packages including Vienna ab initio simulation (VASP), projector-augmented wave (PAW), Perdew-Burke Ernzerhof (PBE) and spin-polarized DFT is discussed in detail. A comprehensive discussion of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of MFNs-SACs is evaluated. In the end, conclusions and future outlooks are provided with a focus on what is already achieved and what further can be achieved in the field by utilizing advanced scientific research and knowledge.
