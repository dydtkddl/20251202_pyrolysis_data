You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel carbon-based materials for sustainable water treatment: Perfluorooctanoic acid adsorption and adsorbent regeneration via thermally activated persulfate oxidation Rapid increases in municipal and industrial waste pose significant environmental challenges, prompting the need for sustainable technologies. This study reports a framework that combines the production of adsorbents with value-added processes to be used in the remediation of water streams polluted by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as a target compound. This framework is based on adsorption and regeneration cycles using thermally persulfate-activated advanced oxidation process. Carbon-rich waste, including olive pomace and urban plastic residues, was used to synthesize five carbonaceous materials—activated carbon, hydrochar, pyrochar, activated carbon from hydrochar, and carbon nanotubes—via hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis. The adsorbents demonstrated PFOA adsorption capacities ranging from 55 to 303 mg·g⁻¹ , with activated carbon achieving the highest (303 mg·g⁻¹) due to its microporous structure. Adsorption equilibrium followed the Langmuir model, while adsorption kinetics were best described by a pseudo-second-order model. Regeneration was performed using thermally activated persulfate at 60°C. Activated carbon recovered over 70 % of its adsorption capacity with lower oxidant consumption, whereas hydrochar and carbon nanotubes exhibited higher oxidant use and greater structural changes. These results underscore the potential of waste-derived carbon materials for sustainable water treatment and circular economy applications, providing effective removal of persistent pollutants like PFOA with great promise.
