You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A state-of-the-art review focusing on the fabrication technique of activated chitosan-bitumin coal based multifunctional bionanocomposites for industrial wastewater treatment: Production, characterization, and fixed bed column adsorption study In this review, the fabrication route of activated chitosan-bitumin coal (AC-BC) multifunctional bionanocomposite for industrial wastewater treatment by using a down-flow fixed-bed column adsorption technique. This is crucial to purify the industrial effluents by developing ecofriendly and cost effective technology before discharging which is usually loaded with several toxicants. Otherwise, they can easily contaminate our food chain resulting in a punitive destruction to the ecology as well as public safety and/or health security. To mitigate this serious environmental issue scientists are trying to develop a much more efficient, economical, and ecofriendly realistic technique for the purification of real-time bulky industrial effluents. While continuous column adsorption technique can be very innovative and beneficial one due to its outstanding features. However, AC-BC based bionanocomposite would be a suitable candidate for its much availability, biodegradability, lower cost, higher efficiency, and outstanding physicochemical, thermomechanical, and morphological properties with sensational adsorption performances. Still there is some difficulties regarding the actual processing of the precursor, the fabrication technique and their application mode for the purification of crude wastewater. Hence, this study will be dedicated by focusing on the significant fabrication techniques and application modes along with the possible synergistic mechanism indicating the chemical adsorption, physical adsorption (multi/monolayer), interparticular diffusion/deep penetration and mathematical modellings for better clarity. By ascertaining gaps that belong to the existing study and providing forthcoming research directions, this critical overview aims to improve the overall fabrication, characterization, application of the AC-BC bionanosorbents in the real-time bulky industrial wastewater for sustainable environmental protection.
