You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A sustainable approach on thermal and catalytic conversion of waste plastics into fuels Plastics have one of the highest rates of development due to its numerous uses, adaptability, and comparatively low cost. Due to the short average lifespan of plastic items, there is a significant annual flow of plastic garbage (34.7 lakh tonnes per annum (TPA)) to the ultimate consumers, which poses a substantial environmental threat. Recycled plastic makes up 50% of all generated plastic garbage and remaining retained as plastic waste (17 lakh tonnes per annum (TPA))). Again, there is a critical need for substitutes to dumping or land filling since regulations and growing costs are making it increasingly difficult to dispose of post-consumer plastics. Also, the conventional methods of burning and landfilling may result in environmental pollution and the waste of valuable land. This review highlighted the sources, kinds, and occurrence of plastic garbage in the atmosphere as well as its consequences on the environment and people. The study’s first focus is on the origins and technique of thermochemical conversion of plastic waste. There has been discussion on the circular economy of plastic trash as well as the manufacturing of sustainable products from plastic garbage, such as oil, char, sorbent materials, fuels, and chemicals. An inventive additional method for producing such value-added goods from plastic trash is catalytic degradation. The potential for emissions, future technological advancement, and sustainability concerns were considered as potential downsides for thermochemical processes. To increase the production of value-added goods (fuel) with little investment and little impact on the environment, further research is needed. The report examines the body of literature that is currently accessible in this area of ongoing research and points out any gaps that require more investigation.
