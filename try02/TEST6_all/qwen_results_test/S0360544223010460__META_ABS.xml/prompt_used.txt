You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic recovery of renewable hydrocarbon resources via microwave co-pyrolysis of biomass residue and plastic waste over spent toner catalyst towards sustainable solid waste management The present study unveiled the effect of operating temperature, blending ratio and catalyst addition on the product distribution during microwave co-pyrolysis of Hydnocarpus de-oiled seed cake (HDSC) and Waste electrical and electronic plastic (WEEP). In this work, a new approach of “treatment of wastes with waste” was proposed by converting spent toner powder into a low-cost catalyst. Initially, co-pyrolysis process was conducted in which the operating temperature were changed to 450, 500, and 550 °C corresponding to HDSC:WEEP mixture ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100. The result shows that oil phase yield was significantly higher for 50:50 mixture ratio and this condition further selected for addition of catalyst. The catalytic co-pyrolysis result shows that produced oil have a density of 0.862 g/mL, high calorific value of 39.51 MJ/kg and viscosity 2.71 cSt which is comparable to commercial diesel fuel. The GC-MS study discovered that addition of catalyst could significantly suppress the oxygen and nitrogen compounds while promote the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons through Diels-Alder reaction mechanism. Finally, techno economic analysis revealed that 1000 kg/h plant demonstrated to be economically viable, with minimal production cost (USD 0.53/L compared to USD 1.15/L of commercial diesel fuel price in India).
