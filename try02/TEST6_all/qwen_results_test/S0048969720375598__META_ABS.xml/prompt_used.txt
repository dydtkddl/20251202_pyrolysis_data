You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of high-temperature and microwave expanding modification on reactivity of coal char for char-NO interaction Coal-fired industrial boiler has become a large source of atmospheric pollutants in China, urging to achieve low NOx emissions. This paper adjusts the coal char structure with high-temperature/microwave expanding modification to investigate the char-NO interaction. The results show that after high-temperature or microwave expansion, the pore structure of char is further expanded with more new pore structure of 2–12 nm. The proper expansion temperature/power/treatment-time increases the ablation collapse of char pores and the order of carbon structure. With microwave, COC and CO bands break, forming a large amount of aromatic CC unsaturated carbon atoms, incrseasing the surface active sites of char-NO interaction. The optimum modifications of char-NO reactivity are 800 °C-90 s and 960 W-90 s. The reduction rate of NO by microwave modified char decreases with increase of inlet NO (<1200 ppm), and increases with increase of inlet CO (<8000 ppm). Burnout time of microwave modified char is shortened, with more rapid release of NO and larger conversion rate of char-N to NO. With microwave field, the conversion rate of char-N to NO at 900 °C is more significant than that at 600 °C. The too large microwave power cannot further shorten the char burnout time and the release time of NO.
