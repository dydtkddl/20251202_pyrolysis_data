Extension of a coarse grained particle method to simulate heat transfer in fluidized beds The heat transfer in a gas-solids fluidized bed is simulated with computational fluid dynamic-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) and coarse grained particle method (CGPM). In CGPM fewer numerical particles and their collisions are tracked by lumping several real particles into a computational parcel. The assumption is that the real particles inside a coarse grained particle (CGP) are made from same species and share identical physical properties including density, diameter and temperature. The parcel-fluid convection term in CGPM is calculated using the same method as in DEM. For all other heat transfer mechanisms, we derive in this study mathematical expressions that relate the new heat transfer terms for CGPM to those traditionally derived in DEM. This newly derived CGPM model is verified and validated by comparing the results with CFD-DEM simulation results and experiment data. The numerical results compare well with experimental data for both hydrodynamics and temperature profiles. The proposed CGPM model can be used for fast and accurate simulations of heat transfer in large scale gas-solids fluidized beds.
