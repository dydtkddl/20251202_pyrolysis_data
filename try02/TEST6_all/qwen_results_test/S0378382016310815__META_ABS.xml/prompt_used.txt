You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive CFD modelling of solar fast pyrolysis of beech wood pellets The present work focuses on the study of the solar pyrolysis of beech wood pellets. The biomass degradation process was modelled in the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) platform ANSYS FLUENT 14.0. The results of simulations were compared to experimental tests conducted in a lab-scale solar reactor in order to validate the CFD model. The biomass pyrolysis was carried out at temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000°C, at two heating rates: 10 and 50°C/s. This new 2D single particle model represents a significant improvement of previous simpler version, not only because it allows monitoring the evolution of gas speciation but also because its formulation enables to deal with different types of biomass feedstock. The model structure comprises a multi-step complex kinetic framework that involves competitive reactions –including secondary tar reaction- along with rigorous heat and mass (species) transport inside the particle. On this basis, char, tar and gas predicted yields are compared with experimental data. In addition, the gas composition (CH4, CO, CO2, H2 and CxHy) is also compared. CFD results are in good agreement with the experimental values, validating this approach as a useful tool to predict the products yields and their composition when pyrolyzing biomass particles. Furthermore, the model can be used when modelling any process where pyrolysis occurs and it can even be easily coupled to any reactor scale model.
