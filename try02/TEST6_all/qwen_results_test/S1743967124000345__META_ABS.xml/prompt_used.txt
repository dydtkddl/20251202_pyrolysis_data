You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing light fuel production through catalytic pyrolysis of municipal mixed plastic waste over activated spent FCC catalyst To address the issue of environmental pollution caused by waste plastics and increase their recycling utilization, a cost-effective chemical recycling method was employed in this study. It involved the use of spent fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts to convert waste plastics into valuable products. Sequential nitric acid treatment and pore expansion by ammonium hexafluorosilicate methods were employed to activate the spent FCC catalyst, with the aim of improving its physicochemical properties and enhancing the production of light fuel. The results demonstrated that activation treatment of the spent FCC catalyst improved the external surface area and meso-macroporous volumes of the activated catalysts. This process facilitated the initial cracking reaction of polyolefin macromolecules and alleviated the diffusion limitations of reactants and products within the pores of the catalyst, resulting in an increase in the yield of light fuels. Compared to the spent FCC catalyst, the activated catalysts exhibited 5.79–19.49% higher selectivities for light olefins and 21.67–29.76% higher yields for light fuels. These findings provide potential opportunities for the valuable utilization of waste plastics.
