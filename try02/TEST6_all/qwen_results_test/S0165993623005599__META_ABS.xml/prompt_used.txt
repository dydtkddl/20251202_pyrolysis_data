You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mass spectrometry detection of environmental microplastics: Advances and challenges Mass spectrometry has emerged as a vital tool for microplastics (MPs) analysis, offering sensitivity and specificity to identify diverse polymer types. This review explores mass spectrometry's applications, including time-of-flight, orbitrap, quadrupole, and magnetic sector. Time-of-flight provides direct detection with modest sensitivity, while orbitrap excels in low molecular weight MPs analysis (<50000 Da). Quadrupole assesses thermal or depolymerized products, and magnetic sector scrutinizes isotopic ratios for MPs source identification. Sample pretreatment methods for mass spectrometry were summarized; traditional techniques risk MPs loss, while solvent-based methods like accelerated solvent extraction offer effectiveness, influenced by MPs chain structure. A positive correlation between mass spectrometry and spectroscopy results is observed, hindered by MPs' variable shapes and sizes. Mass spectrometry also aids nanoplastics analysis and oligomer detection. In conclusion, this review underscores mass spectrometry's role in microplastics analysis, discussing strengths, limitations, and prospects.
