You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In situ hydrodeoxygenation of heavy bio-oil using a Ce/Fe-based oxygen carrier in methanol-zero valent aluminum media Resource recovery from solid organic wastes, such as degradable plastics, and upgrading raw bio-oil are important ways for reducing carbon and pollution emissions. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a common thermochemical treatment to upgrade crude bio-oil. In this study, in order to realize in situ HDO during the hydropyrolysis of heavy bio-oil and degradable plastics, a reduced Fe/Ce oxygen carrier (OC) was used to catalytically remove oxygen from organics under the methanol-zero valent aluminum (ZV Al) media, where the hydrogen was produced during pyrolysis instead of a direct hydrogen supply. The results showed that the reduced OC captured the oxygen from the pyrolysis products of heavy bio-oil and degradable plastic, representing the multi-selectivity of reduced OC to phenols, ketones, etc. The ZV Al system promoted the production and utilization of hydrogen, as evidenced by the increased hydrogen content in gas phase and hydrocarbon content in liquid phase. The hydrocarbon component distribution in the liquid phase increased clearly when hydropyrolysis with degradable plastics addtion, but the excess degradable plastics addition caused increasing of the liquid product viscosity, and decreasing of the liquid products yield for the higher ash content in degradable plastic, and a higher ZV Al amount was required to maintain the hydropyrolysis. Molecular dynamics simulations verified the synergistic effect of degradable plastics and bio-oil by the pyrolysis behavior in different systems and temperatures, and the pyrolysis pathways were proposed. This non-autocatalytic system realized the resource recovery and heavy bio-oil upgrading using an Fe/Ce OC.
