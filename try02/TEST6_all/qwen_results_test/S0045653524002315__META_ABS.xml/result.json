  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on hydropyrolysis of heavy bio-oil and degradable plastics, but the primary feedstock is bio-oil, not waste plastics or commercial polymers, and the core methodology involves molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical pathways, lacking lab-scale experimental data on plastic pyrolysis."
