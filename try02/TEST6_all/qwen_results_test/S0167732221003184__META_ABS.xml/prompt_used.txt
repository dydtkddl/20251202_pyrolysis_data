You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorptive removal of different pollutants using metal-organic framework adsorbents Soil, air, and water pollutions remain the major worldwide challenges for both human and eco-environment society. Decontamination of pollutants such as organic and inorganic compounds from an ecosystem remains a bottleneck over the years. Among several methods for removing pollutants, adsorption stands unique and usually simple and efficient. However, the versatility of the adsorption technique largely determines by the materials' sorption capacities which depend on the porous structures and surface property of the adsorbent. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a novel class of carbonaceous nanomaterials” having larger specific surface areas and their oxides have unique functional groups required for good adsorption processes. The applications of MOFs remain the focus of many kinds of researches in the last few years for effective removal of different contaminations from the soil, air, and water. This review presents some advancements in the usages of these novel MOFs for the adsorptive removal of different contaminants from the ecosystems. The study also highlighted some promising MOF adsorbents used for the effective removal of different pollutants including heavy metals, CO2, chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), dyes, pesticides, food additives, veterinary, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCP), antibiotics, biological and chemical weapons, other industrial chemicals, etc. Still, the discovery of the actual feasibility and applicability of the MOFs usages as adsorbents on the commercial scales are highly needed. The reusability of these adsorbents is continuously desirable to reduce the cost and associated wastes produced from the pollutant removal processes. For more effective and practical applicability of MOFs, some frequent and unnoticed factors were also proposed as the challenges and prospects to foster the remarkable improvements in combating different pollutants. We further established that despite the existence of hitches and challenges associated with the use of MOFs, these materials are undeniably advantageous for decontaminating pollutants from wastewater, and upon sustaining efforts, their practical applications for water purification, separation, and other adsorption purposes will shortly be evident.
