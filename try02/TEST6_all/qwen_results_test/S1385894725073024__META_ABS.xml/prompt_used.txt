You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Melanoidins induced transformation of protein and polysaccharide during thermal hydrolysis-pyrolysis of sludge via non-covalent forces The migration behavior of melanoidins in thermal hydrolysis pretreatment-pyrolysis (THP-PY) of sludge, exhibiting irreversible negative impact for the utilization of organic resources. However, the transformation of proteins and polysaccharides regulated by melanoidins remains unclear. The non-covalent effects of melanoidins in THP-PY were explored. High temperature-THP increased the extracellular hydrophilic groups release and mass transfer efficiency, forming melanoidins mainly contributed by soluble organic matter, followed by LB-EPS and TB-EPS. The non-covalent force of melanoidins preferentially binds to the protein secondary structure, enhancing the structural stability of the solid phase, leading to the retention of CH3, C=O, and C–OH & C–O–C groups. This facilitates the degradation of polysaccharides and fragmentation of protein secondary structure in the aqueous phase, which improving the reactivity of soluble organic matters. THP increased the release of proteins and polysaccharides in solid-phase product during PY by 1.92–22.03%, forming aromatic stable structure and mesopore structure in biochar, ultimately restraining the reactivity of melanoidins. Critically, THP-PY impeded the formation of melanoidins, resulting in a reduction of pyridine-N and nitrile-N in bio-oil by 80.58 % and 38.96 %, respectively. This is mainly attributed to the steady-state structure in biochar mediated by non-covalent forces, which limits the transformation of amine-N into melanoidins and converts into aliphatic hydrocarbons in the organic phase. THP-PY also weakened the non-polarity of ketones and aldehydes in the aqueous phase, thereby inhibiting the conversion of protein into melanoidins. These findings reveal the non-covalent behavior of melanoidins in the TH-PY process of sludge and offer guidance for the recovery of high-value products.
