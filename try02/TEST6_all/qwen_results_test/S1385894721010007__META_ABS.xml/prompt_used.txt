You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic wastes in a continuous microwave assisted pyrolysis system for fuel production The soaring use of plastics has resulted in alarming issues such as environmental pollution and unsustainable production of plastics. Pyrolysis of plastic wastes has emerged as a promising chemical recycling method, to recover energy and materials from this resource. In this study, the pyrolysis of plastic wastes was conducted in a novel, continuous, microwave-assisted pyrolysis (CMAP) system for fuel production; the effects of temperature, plastic composition, and catalysis on the product yields and composition were investigated. Higher pyrolysis temperatures promoted the cracking of wax and production of lighter and more stable hydrocarbons. Talc as a plastic filler in polypropylene showed a high cracking activity. Incorporating ZSM-5 catalysts at a weight hourly space velocity of 10 h−1 and a pyrolysis temperature of 620 °C resulted in a liquid yield of 48.9%, and this product consisted of 73.5% gasoline-range hydrocarbons rich in aromatic (45.0%) and isomerized aliphatic (24.6%) contents. The catalyst rapidly lost its activity at a feedstock/catalyst ratio of 5. Energy balance analysis showed that 5 MJ of electrical energy was required to process 1 kg of HDPE with the CMAP system, giving an energy efficiency as high as 89.6% 6.1 MJ electrical energy could be generated from the gas products alone, making the process energy self-sufficient. Overall, the CMAP system, featuring a combination of microwave heating with a SiC mixing-ball-bed, is a promising design for industrial application of energy recovery from plastic wastes due to its advantages, including: 1) higher energy efficiency, and 2) lower processing temperature than conventional fluidized-bed reactors.
