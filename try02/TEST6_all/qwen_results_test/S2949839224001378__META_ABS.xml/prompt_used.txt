You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unravelling the impact of lignin particle size and content on enhanced value in plastic composites The shift towards a sustainable plastics economy is driving interest in agricultural waste and byproducts for plastic composites, offering benefits like enhanced sustainability, reduced costs, and improved mechanical properties. Lignin, one of the three main components of lignocellulosic biomass, is a promising filler for polymer composites due to its abundance, reactivity, and functional properties, despite challenges in extraction and processing. This review examines the impact of lignin particle size reduction, from microparticles (LMPs) to nanoparticles (LNPs), on the properties of polymer composites, focusing on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and other polyesters. Reducing lignin particle size can enhance stress transfer and particle wetting in the matrix, although optimal size thresholds and filler contents for desired properties remain uncertain. The paper discusses lignin's characteristics based on source and size reduction method, its functionalization for better dispersion, and various preparation methods of lignin-containing composites. Applications in packaging and are agriculture are highlighted, with an emphasis on achieving a balance between improved properties, cost efficiency, and environmental impact. Finally, it highlights the need for standardized reporting on lignin’s origin, isolation method, molecular weight, Tg, and particle size to enable effective comparisons and advancements in lignin-based polymer composites.
