You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrospun functional micro/nanochannels embedded in porous carbon electrodes for microfluidic biosensing We present a straightforward method for fabricating functional micro-, submicro-, and nano-channels embedded in a porous carbon film and the application of this microfluidic platform for electrochemical sensing. A skin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) fibers was first electrospun on a thoroughly cleaned Si wafer substrate, followed by spin coating of a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) film on top of the skin. High-temperature carbonization of the composite film decomposed the PMMA fibers and produced embedded microchannels in the PAN-derived amorphous monolithic carbon electrode. The channels were decorated with Pt nanoparticles by in situ thermal decomposition of a precursor metal salt to enhance functionality of the carbon electrode. Carbon electrodes decorated with Pt nanoparticles (carbon-Pt), with and without embedded microchannels, were used to detect the food toxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by surface biofunctionalization with the antibodies of AFB1 (anti-AFB1) via an electrochemical impedance technique. The aligned nanochannels in the porous carbon film act as a reaction chamber for antigen–antibody interactions and provide channels for fast electron transport toward the electrode from the electrolyte, resulting in improved electrochemical performance of the biosensor. The fabricated immunosensor is highly sensitive to 1pg/mL of AFB1 with a concentration range of 10−12–10−7 g/mL.
