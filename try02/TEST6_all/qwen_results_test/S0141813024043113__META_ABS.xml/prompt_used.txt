You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unlocking the potential: Evolving role of technical lignin in diverse applications and overcoming challenges Recent advancements have transformed lignin from a byproduct into a valuable raw material for polymers, dyes, adhesives, and fertilizers. However, its structural heterogeneity, variable reactive group content, impurities, and high extraction costs pose challenges to industrial-scale adoption. Efficient separation technologies and selective bond cleavage are crucial. Advanced pretreatment methods have enhanced lignin purity and reduced contamination, while novel catalytic techniques have improved depolymerization efficiency and selectivity. This review compares catalytic depolymerization methodologies, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages, and noting challenges in comparing yield values due to variations in isolation methods and lignin sources. Recognizing “technical lignin” from pulping processes, the review emphasizes its diverse applications and the necessity of understanding its structural characteristics. Emerging trends focus on bio-based functional additives and nanostructured lignin materials, promising enhanced properties and functionalities. Innovations open possibilities in sustainable agriculture, high-performance foams and composites, and advanced medical applications like drug delivery and wound healing. Leveraging lignin's biocompatibility, abundance, and potential for high-value applications, it can significantly contribute to sustainable material development across various industries. Continuous research in bio-based additives and nanostructured materials underscores lignin's potential to revolutionize material science and promote environmentally friendly industrial applications.
