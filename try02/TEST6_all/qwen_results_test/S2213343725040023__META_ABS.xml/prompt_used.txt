You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-based and biodegradable polymers for composites: Sustainability, challenges, and future perspectives The growing attention towards sustainability in the composites industry has accelerated the transition to bio-based polymer matrices. Among them, polyamide 11 (PA-11), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) show great potential as alternatives to fossil-based thermoplastics, and an increase in their industrial production is expected in the coming years. These polymers display various properties, ranging from high mechanical performance to biodegradability, making them well-suited for composites, particularly those reinforced with natural fibers. This review explores PA-11, PLA, and PHAs, focusing mainly on their synthesis, properties, and performances on composite materials. A detailed analysis of their environmental impact is provided through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using global warming potential (GWP) and non-renewable energy use (NREU) as parameters. Several End-of-Life (EoL) scenarios, including biodegradability, recyclability, and industrial composting, are assessed to explore their roles in the circular economy strategies. Perspectives on future research and industrial applications are discussed at the end, including calls for improved processing techniques, property optimization, and EoL management strategies.
