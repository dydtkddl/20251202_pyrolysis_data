Bio-based and biodegradable polymers for composites: Sustainability, challenges, and future perspectives The growing attention towards sustainability in the composites industry has accelerated the transition to bio-based polymer matrices. Among them, polyamide 11 (PA-11), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) show great potential as alternatives to fossil-based thermoplastics, and an increase in their industrial production is expected in the coming years. These polymers display various properties, ranging from high mechanical performance to biodegradability, making them well-suited for composites, particularly those reinforced with natural fibers. This review explores PA-11, PLA, and PHAs, focusing mainly on their synthesis, properties, and performances on composite materials. A detailed analysis of their environmental impact is provided through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using global warming potential (GWP) and non-renewable energy use (NREU) as parameters. Several End-of-Life (EoL) scenarios, including biodegradability, recyclability, and industrial composting, are assessed to explore their roles in the circular economy strategies. Perspectives on future research and industrial applications are discussed at the end, including calls for improved processing techniques, property optimization, and EoL management strategies.
