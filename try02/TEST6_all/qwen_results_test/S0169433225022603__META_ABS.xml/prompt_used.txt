You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous N/W co-doping of alkali niobate/g-C3N4 composites by ultrasonic-spray pyrolysis: Synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activity This study reports for the first time the simultaneous W6+ and N3– co-doping as graphitic g-C3N4 into the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 phase via ultrasonic-spray pyrolysis using glycine as a N source. The synthesis mechanism of the nanostructured N/W co-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 material is discussed. Glycine facilitates the control of morphology and growth of primary particles formation into spherical dense particles and promoted a self-assembled of N and W co-doping within K0.5Na0.5NbO3 material, including the in-situ formation of structured g-C3N4. The monoclinic symmetry of the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 perovskite phase was confirmed and glycine It is demonstrated that part of glycine undergoes decomposition during rapid pyrolysis forming carbon layers similar to graphene oxide. A decrease in the energy band gap from 3.2 eV for the non-doped perovskite to 1.5 eV for N-doped perovskite suggests the present materials can be scaling-up for both solar-driven photocatalytic reactions and photovoltaic devices confirmed by the estimation of the Urbach energy. Compared with direct photolysis, the present material showed and enhanced photocatalytic activity up to 12 times higher in the degradation of the azo-dye basic blue 41. The present methodology represents a significant advancement in the synthesis of photocatalysts for the efficient removal and degradation of azo dye molecules.
