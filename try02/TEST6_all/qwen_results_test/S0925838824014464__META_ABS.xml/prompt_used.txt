You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements and future prospects of additive manufacturing in high-entropy alloy applications A comprehensive review of Additive Manufacturing (AM) of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) is presented, exploring the opportunities for producing advanced components with tailored properties through design-based alloys. HEAs have emerged as promising metallic materials with unique properties that cater to the needs of modern industries. The utilization of AM, a 3D printing technology, allows for the creation of intricately designed products with minimized defects by tailoring microstructural features. The combination of HEAs and AM offers exceptional mechanical properties, improved wear resistance, and enhanced corrosion behavior by optimizing process parameters. This article thoroughly reviews recent advancements in fabricating AM-built parts using HEAs, focusing on powder feedstock, microstructural aspects, phase formation, strengthening mechanisms, and resulting mechanical properties. Furthermore, it explores various applications of AM-processed HEAs in industries such as medical, hydrogen storage, aerospace, nuclear, coating, and automotive, providing detailed insights into their usage. The challenges encountered during the AM process are discussed, and future directions for enhancing the quality of customized products are outlined. This review article offers valuable insights into the realm of additive manufacturing AM of HEAs, incorporating recent developments. It catalyzes future research endeavors in this field.
