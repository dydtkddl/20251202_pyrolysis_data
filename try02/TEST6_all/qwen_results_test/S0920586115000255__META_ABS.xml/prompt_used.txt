You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Natural aluminosilicates for catalytic depolymerization of polyethylene to produce liquid fuel-grade hydrocarbons and low olefins Different chemical modifications were performed to the natural aluminosilicate Montanit300® in order to improve its catalytic activity in PE depolymerization. Performance of such prepared catalysts was compared to established solid acid catalysts, such as HZSM-5, sulfonated and fluorinated γ-Al2O3 and amorphous silica–alumina. Pyridine TG and DRIFTS characterization revealed mild acid treatment and aluminum grafting as successful in increasing acid site density through impurity removal and specific surface area increase. Mesoporous catalyst structure that allows facile diffusion through its pore network, together with high-density Brønsted acid sites, was found to be crucial to obtain high catalytic activity. The T 50 value for PE depolymerization was lowered by 162°C with sulfonated γ-Al2O3 solid, compared to non-catalyzed reaction, whereas with aluminum-grafted Montanit300® catalyst this value was lowered by 65°C. PE depolymerization products present in the condensed liquid phase using aluminum-grafted Montanit300® catalyst were exclusively alkanes with chain length up to 21 carbon atoms. Liquid, coke and gas yields were found to be 53, 0.4 and 46.6%, respectively, the latter consisting of linear and branched C2–C4 alkenes and alkanes.
