Study on the carbonation properties of BOFS with γ-C2S blending β-C2S is the main active mineral component in Basic Oxygen Furnace slag (BOFS), while the content of β-C2S in BOFS is usually limited and fluctuated, which hindered the improvement of CO2 capture during carbonation. To enhance the carbonation reactivity of BOFS products, different ratio of γ-C2S was blended with BOFS powder and carbonated, followed by hydration curing. XRD and TGA analysis were used to determine the mineral composition of each blending group after carbonation. SEM analysis was applied to observe the microstructure, and the MIP method was used to analyze the pore size structure. The results show that the carbonation degree and compressive strength of BOFS cubes were increased by the addition of γ-C2S. With 20 wt% blending of γ-C2S, the carbonated BOFS obtained the optimum increasement of carbonation degree and compressive strength, reaching 39.3% and 42.4 MPa, respectively. However, the subsequent hydration reactivity of BOFS was inhibited when blended with 20 wt% of γ-C2S. Despite this, the increased poorly crystalline CaCO3 filled the system and densified the matrix, contributing to a 17.9% increase in compressive strength of SH20 after 56 days of hydration curing.
