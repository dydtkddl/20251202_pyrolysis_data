You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the carbonation properties of BOFS with γ-C2S blending β-C2S is the main active mineral component in Basic Oxygen Furnace slag (BOFS), while the content of β-C2S in BOFS is usually limited and fluctuated, which hindered the improvement of CO2 capture during carbonation. To enhance the carbonation reactivity of BOFS products, different ratio of γ-C2S was blended with BOFS powder and carbonated, followed by hydration curing. XRD and TGA analysis were used to determine the mineral composition of each blending group after carbonation. SEM analysis was applied to observe the microstructure, and the MIP method was used to analyze the pore size structure. The results show that the carbonation degree and compressive strength of BOFS cubes were increased by the addition of γ-C2S. With 20 wt% blending of γ-C2S, the carbonated BOFS obtained the optimum increasement of carbonation degree and compressive strength, reaching 39.3% and 42.4 MPa, respectively. However, the subsequent hydration reactivity of BOFS was inhibited when blended with 20 wt% of γ-C2S. Despite this, the increased poorly crystalline CaCO3 filled the system and densified the matrix, contributing to a 17.9% increase in compressive strength of SH20 after 56 days of hydration curing.
