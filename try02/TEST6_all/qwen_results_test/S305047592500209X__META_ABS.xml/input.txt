Fate of waste plastics: A review Waste plastic is a critical issue, impacting all forms of life, including human health, the economy, and natural ecosystems worldwide. In 2023, global plastic waste generation was approximately 389.33 million tons, with 49.22 % accumulated in landfills, 21.63 % mismanaged, 18.85 % incinerated, and only 10.30 % recycled. If the current trend continues, by 2050, global plastic waste generation will reach approximately 798.58 million tons, with landfills receiving 397.82 million tons. This critical review summarizes various advanced initiatives for upcycling plastic waste, including waste-to-fuel, waste-to-value-added products, and waste-to-hydrogen. Metal-doped mesoporous bi-metallic catalysts play a vital role in enhancing the quality of fuel products at lower temperatures and with shorter retention times. Engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) can upcycle waste polymers into value-added products such as vanillin and adipic acid. Waste plastics have also been successfully converted into hydrogen or carbonaceous nanomaterials. A technology that produces hydrogen and carbonaceous nanomaterials simultaneously could provide a sustainable solution for managing non-biodegradable waste plastics, thereby helping to protect our environment.
