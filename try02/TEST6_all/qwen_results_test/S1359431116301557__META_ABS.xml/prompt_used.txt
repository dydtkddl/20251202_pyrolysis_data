You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improvement of renewable transportation fuel properties by deoxygenation process using thermal and catalytic cracking of triglycerides and their methyl esters Growth of the world energy consumption, depletion of energy sources and global warming related to fossil fuel consumption have increased the attention toward the production of renewable fuels. Conversion of vegetable oil and fats (natural triglycerides) to biofuel is one of the options to produce renewable fuels for the transportation sector, but the yield and quality of products are among the important factors in the process. This paper presents some of the results obtained from the study of deoxygenation and ketonization processes using thermal/catalytic cracking of sunflower oil and its methyl esters for the production of transportation biofuels. Sunflower oil was converted to methyl ester in the presence of KOH through transesterification reaction and was used as a feed for the cracking process. Fuel properties after thermal cracking of sunflower oil and its methyl esters have been compared to determine the benefits of transesterification process as a pretreatment step for the triglycerides. To reduce the oxygen content of the liquid products and improve properties of the fuel after catalytic cracking using HZSM-5, deoxygenation over γ-Al2O3 and ketonization over MnO2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were examined. Results show that depending on the thermal cracking severity, while the yields of the liquid organic products from thermal cracking of sunflower oil and its methyl esters were almost the same, their acidity vary between 3.78 and 5.41 mg KOH/g for methyl esters and between 66.16 and 123.41 mg KOH/g for triglycerides. The extracted heavier cuts similar to gas oil vary between 5.26% and 22.35% for methyl esters and between 18.39% and 51.03% for triglycerides, which proves the benefits of methyl ester cracking to the original oil cracking. Decarboxylation and ketonization of the liquid products with catalysts reduce the acidity and improve other properties of the fuel to the standard level.
