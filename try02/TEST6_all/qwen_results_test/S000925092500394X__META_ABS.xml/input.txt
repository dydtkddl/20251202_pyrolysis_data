Continuous fixed bed adsorption of ammonium ion on carbon black modified with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate beads This study demonstrates the high efficiency of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate-modified carbon black (CBp-SDBS) beads for ammonium (NH4 +) removal in a continuous fixed-bed column system. The beads achieved a maximum adsorption capacity of 87.15 mg/g, surpassing conventional adsorbents. Increasing bed length (9 cm) and decreasing influent concentration (0.2 mmol/L) significantly enhanced adsorption efficiency, while higher flow rates (5 mL/s) reduced contact time, lowering removal efficiency. The Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models accurately predicted adsorption behavior, confirming their suitability for column design. Regeneration studies showed CBp-SDBS beads retained adsorption efficiency over five cycles, with NaCl demonstrating superior desorption performance compared to distilled water. These findings highlight CBp-SDBS beads as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative for ammonium removal, contributing to wastewater treatment and circular economy applications.
