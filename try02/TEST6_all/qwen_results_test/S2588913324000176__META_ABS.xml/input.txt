A comprehensive review on activated carbon from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass: An application for energy and the environment Activated carbon (AC) possesses several versatile properties that make it a valuable material, including a higher surface area, high adsorption capacity, microporous structure, and increased surface reactivity. AC generation from pyrolysis of biomass can be economical and environmentally responsible using varied conversion technologies (thermochemical and biological processes). This review paper studied the effects of pre-treatment technology, activation process, and heating rates during the AC production stage. Also, the properties and abilities of AC generated from biomass were revealed. It also examined the catalytic performance of commercial compounds obtained from biomass and their combinations with other materials to improve bio-oil. Additionally, this paper deals with catalytic pyrolysis of biomass (phenol and hydrocarbon generation), adsorption of organic and pharmaceutical pollutants, and absorption of gases using AC. This comprehensive review offers a new perspective on creating biomass-derived activated carbon with superior characteristics for enhancing the absorption capacity of gases and organic and pharmaceutical pollutants.
