You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insecticidal properties of pyrolysis bio-oil from greenhouse tomato residue biomass Fast pyrolysis is a recognized technology for the thermochemical conversion of biomasses into bio-oils that may contain valuable chemicals, including solvents, pharmaceuticals and biopesticides. The composition of the bio-oils is partly determined by the biomass feedstock. Bio-oil produced from the residues of greenhouse tomato plants has been investigated as a potential source of bioactive and pesticidal compounds. Fast pyrolysis of dried tomato residue biomass was performed in a bubbling bed reactor at 300 and 500°C. The condensable vapors were collected using a condenser followed by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Bio-oil collected from the ESP exhibited a much greater insecticidal activity based on tests carried out using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) Leptinotarsa decemlineata leaf disc bioassay. After an extraction with 1:1 water/dichloromethane, most of the activity remained in the organic phase. To further fractionate the components, amino solid phase extractions (SPE) followed by reversed phase LC separation were performed. Six LC fractions were collected and analyzed by GC–MS. Neophytadiene, phytol and a number of fatty acids were identified in the most active fraction, but only with combinations of these compounds was the greatest insecticidal activity obtained. Pyrolysis of tomato plant biomass affords a cost-effective source of bioactive compounds that can be further developed for biopesticide application.
