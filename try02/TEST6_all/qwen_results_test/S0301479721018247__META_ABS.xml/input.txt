Sustainable remediation of hazardous environmental pollutants using biochar-based nanohybrid materials Biochar is a well-known carbon material with diversified functionalities and excellent physicochemical characteristics with high wastewater treatment potential. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in the development of biochar and biochar-based nanohybrid materials as a potential tool for the removal of harmful organic compounds such as synthetic dyes/effluents. The formation of biochar using pyrolysis of renewable feedstocks and their applications in various industries are explained hereafter. The characteristics and construction of biochar-based hybrid materials are explained in detail. Diversity of feedstocks, including municipal wastes, industrial byproducts, agricultural, and forestry residues, endows different biochar types with a wide structural variety. The production of cost-effective biochar drives the interest in manipulating biochars and induces desire functionality using nanoscale reinforcements. Various types of biochars, such as magnetic biochar, layered nanomaterial coated biochar, nanometallic oxide composites, chemically and physically functionalized biochar, have been produced. With the aid of nanomaterial, hybrid biochar exhibits a high potential to remove toxic contaminants. Depending upon biochar type, dyes/effluents can be removed via different mechanisms, including the Fenton process, photocatalytic degradation, π–π interaction, electrostatic interaction, and physical adsorption. In conclusion, desired physicochemical features, and tunable surface properties of biochar present high potential material in removing organic dyes and other effluents. The blended biochar with different materials/nanomaterials endows broader development and multi-functional opportunities for treating dyes/effluents.
