You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable remediation of hazardous environmental pollutants using biochar-based nanohybrid materials Biochar is a well-known carbon material with diversified functionalities and excellent physicochemical characteristics with high wastewater treatment potential. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in the development of biochar and biochar-based nanohybrid materials as a potential tool for the removal of harmful organic compounds such as synthetic dyes/effluents. The formation of biochar using pyrolysis of renewable feedstocks and their applications in various industries are explained hereafter. The characteristics and construction of biochar-based hybrid materials are explained in detail. Diversity of feedstocks, including municipal wastes, industrial byproducts, agricultural, and forestry residues, endows different biochar types with a wide structural variety. The production of cost-effective biochar drives the interest in manipulating biochars and induces desire functionality using nanoscale reinforcements. Various types of biochars, such as magnetic biochar, layered nanomaterial coated biochar, nanometallic oxide composites, chemically and physically functionalized biochar, have been produced. With the aid of nanomaterial, hybrid biochar exhibits a high potential to remove toxic contaminants. Depending upon biochar type, dyes/effluents can be removed via different mechanisms, including the Fenton process, photocatalytic degradation, π–π interaction, electrostatic interaction, and physical adsorption. In conclusion, desired physicochemical features, and tunable surface properties of biochar present high potential material in removing organic dyes and other effluents. The blended biochar with different materials/nanomaterials endows broader development and multi-functional opportunities for treating dyes/effluents.
