You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behavior and synergistic effect on co-pyrolysis of rice straw and polystyrene The co-pyrolysis of rice straw (RS) and polystyrene (PS) enhances the quality of bio-oil. In this study, the thermal decomposition behavior, kinetic behavior, and product distribution during RS–PS co-pyrolysis were systematically investigated. Kinetic parameters (A, E, n) were evaluated using OFW, KAS, STK, CR, and MP methods, while product distributions were analyzed via Py-GC/MS at 600 °C. Synergistic effects were quantified using deviations between experimental and theoretical values (ΔW, ΔWE, ΔWP). Results showed that RS decomposes in three stages and PS in a single step, whereas co-pyrolysis proceeds through four distinct stages. The presence of PS delayed RS pyrolysis, attributed to reduced heat transfer caused by molten PS (ΔW < 0 at 330–460 °C). The addition of PS significantly lowered the apparent activation energy, with the RS5PS5 blend exhibiting a strong synergistic effect (ΔWE = –19.5 kJ/mol, KAS). Kinetic modeling revealed that RS follows a multi-step D3 mechanism, while PS conforms to a single-step F1 model. Product analysis demonstrated that increasing PS content enhances the yields of mono- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, while reducing aliphatic and oxygenated compounds. In the RS7PS3 blend, MAHs and PAHs reached 62.55 % and 29.76 %, respectively, highlighting a substantial shift in product composition due to synergistic interactions. These findings highlight co-pyrolysis as an effective method for improving bio-oil quality and addressing plastic waste.
