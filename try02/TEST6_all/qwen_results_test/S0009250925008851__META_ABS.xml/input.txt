Pyrolysis behavior and synergistic effect on co-pyrolysis of rice straw and polystyrene The co-pyrolysis of rice straw (RS) and polystyrene (PS) enhances the quality of bio-oil. In this study, the thermal decomposition behavior, kinetic behavior, and product distribution during RS–PS co-pyrolysis were systematically investigated. Kinetic parameters (A, E, n) were evaluated using OFW, KAS, STK, CR, and MP methods, while product distributions were analyzed via Py-GC/MS at 600 °C. Synergistic effects were quantified using deviations between experimental and theoretical values (ΔW, ΔWE, ΔWP). Results showed that RS decomposes in three stages and PS in a single step, whereas co-pyrolysis proceeds through four distinct stages. The presence of PS delayed RS pyrolysis, attributed to reduced heat transfer caused by molten PS (ΔW < 0 at 330–460 °C). The addition of PS significantly lowered the apparent activation energy, with the RS5PS5 blend exhibiting a strong synergistic effect (ΔWE = –19.5 kJ/mol, KAS). Kinetic modeling revealed that RS follows a multi-step D3 mechanism, while PS conforms to a single-step F1 model. Product analysis demonstrated that increasing PS content enhances the yields of mono- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, while reducing aliphatic and oxygenated compounds. In the RS7PS3 blend, MAHs and PAHs reached 62.55 % and 29.76 %, respectively, highlighting a substantial shift in product composition due to synergistic interactions. These findings highlight co-pyrolysis as an effective method for improving bio-oil quality and addressing plastic waste.
