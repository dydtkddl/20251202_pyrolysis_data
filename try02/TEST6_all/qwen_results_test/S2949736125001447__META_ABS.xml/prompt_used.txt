You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing torrefied rubberwood pellets for sustainable bioenergy: Industrial application, eco-efficiency, and carbon mitigation The global shift towards sustainable bioenergy demands not only improved biomass upgrading methods but also credible validation of their techno-economic and environmental feasibility at an industrial scale. Torrefaction has long been recognized for enhancing biomass fuel properties, yet a persistent challenge lies in translating laboratory results into viable, large-scale applications. This study addresses that challenge by introducing an integrated “optimization-to-application” framework for torrefied rubberwood sawdust pellets (TSP). The framework combines four complementary approaches: (1) laboratory-scale process optimization using a Central Composite Design (CCD) in Design Expert software (DE), systematically varying temperature, time, and initial moisture content due to their critical impact on torrefaction performance; (2) industrial-scale mass and energy balance simulations to evaluate process efficiency and heat recovery; (3) a GIS-based logistical assessment for optimal plant siting; and (4) a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) to quantify environmental outcomes. Laboratory trials identified optimal torrefaction conditions (274.6 °C, 20min, 6% initial moisture), producing TSP with a higher heating value of 21.51MJ/kg, an energy densification ratio of 1.16, and a projected mass yield of 89.5%. Scaling these parameters to an industrial model with a heat recovery efficiency of 71.4% reduced production costs from $223.78 to $203.49 per ton, while lowering process-related CO2 emissions by 43.5% (229.39kg CO2/ton). The resulting Economic Environmental Index (EEI) improved by 162%. A sensitivity analysis using actual operational data from the facility revealed that the LCIA further confirmed notable reductions in global warming potential of 21.29% for plywood/RSP processing, and 38.43% for TSP production. GIS analysis pinpointed a plant location that cut transport costs by 29% compared with a non-integrated site. Collectively, these results demonstrate a practical pathway for deploying TSP as a sustainable industrial fuel. Replacing coal with TSP at a single large-scale cement facility could yield an estimated $86.4million annually in carbon credit value, underscoring both the economic and environmental significance of this transition.
