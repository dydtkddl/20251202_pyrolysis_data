Microplastics pollution in the marine environment: A review of sources, impacts and mitigation Over the past few years, microplastics (MPs) pollution in the marine environment has emerged as a significant environmental concern. Poor management practices lead to millions of tons of plastic waste entering oceans annually, primarily from land-based sources like mismanaged waste, urban runoff, and industrial activities. MPs pollution in marine environments poses a significant threat to ecosystems and human health, as it adsorbs pollutants, heavy metals, and leaches additives such as plasticizers and flame retardants, thus contributing to chemical pollution. The review article provides a comprehensive overview of MPs pollution, its sources, and impacts on marine environments, including human health, detection techniques, and strategies for mitigating microplastic contamination in marine environments. The paper provides current information on microplastic pollution in marine environments, offering insights for researchers, policymakers, and the public, as well as promoting sustainable practices to protect the environment.
