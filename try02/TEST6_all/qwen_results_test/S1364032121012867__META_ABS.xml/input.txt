Principle, development, application design and prospect of fluidized bed heat exchange technology: Comprehensive review Heat exchange is a common operation unit in industrial production, and fluidized bed heat exchange technology (FBHET) has attracted attention because of its unique advantages over other techniques. To date, many experimental studies have been conducted on the application of FBHET in industrial production; however, only a few have successfully achieved upscaled and practical application, and most are still in the laboratory stage. In this paper, the relevant principle and practical application of FBHET are briefly introduced. Research on heat transfer, anti-fouling, and flow characteristics of fluidized bed is highlighted, and innovative suggestions on the development direction and application field of FBHET are proposed. This review aims to update the research progress of FBHET and provide reference for its scale-up application to promote effective energy use and achieve carbon peak and carbon neutralization as soon as possible.
