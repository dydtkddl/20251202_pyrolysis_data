You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modifying carbon nanotubes supported palladium nanoparticles via regulating the electronic metal–carbon interaction for phenol hydrogenation Heteroatom doped carbon materials have been synthesized and served as catalyst supports for Pd nanoparticles (NPs). Numerous Pd-carbon catalysts can be produced via single-, dual-, and multi-doping heteroatoms into carbon supports. Therefore, it is highly desired to seek a universal descriptor, regardless of the doping types, in guiding to the design of efficient catalysts. The electronic state of Pd affected by carbon supports is crucial in catalysis, which can be described by the binding energy (BE) accurately and conveniently using X-ray photon spectroscopy. In this work, the single (dual)-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with tunable doping degrees were synthesized via thermal pyrolysis of heteroatom-containing precursors, accompanied by the defluorination of fluorinated CNTs. Density functional theory results show that the charge distributions of the doped-CNTs are determined by the doping configurations. After loading Pd NPs, the charge of the support redistributes. Meanwhile, the BEs of Pd0 3d5/2 change correspondingly due to the electronic metal–carbon interaction (EMCI). Eventually, Pd NPs with different electronic states show the difference in the turnover frequency of phenol hydrogenation. Therefore, the electronic state of Pd NPs can be considered as a proper descriptor for estimating the catalytic performance and indicator for developing highly efficient catalysts.
