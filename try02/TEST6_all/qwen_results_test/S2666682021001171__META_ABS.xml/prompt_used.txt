You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on transforming lignocellulosic materials into biocarbon and its utilization for composites applications. Growing consumption trends put a strain on natural resource availability as the needs of near-term production targets are prioritized over that of long-term sustainability. In our current linear economic system, raw materials are transformed into useful products for consumption and subsequently disposed of. To achieve environmental sustainability, a circular economic system should be evaluated with the goal to examine and implement potential recovery pathways for waste products. There has been a growing interest in synthesizing biofuels via pyrolysis to move away from unsustainable and disruptive petroleum supply-chains. This aids in achieving sustainability as the products of pyrolysis can be recovered for a wide range of applications. This pyrolysis byproduct is commonly used for agricultural applications and has been receiving recognition due to emerging research on its implementation for composite materials to provide an alternative to carbon black (petroleum-based). As researchers are recognizing the advantages and uncovering more recovery channels for biocarbon, a comprehensive understanding of the recent developments and challenges is required to critically assess the viability of this product to be used in various industries. Given a lack of reviews drawing attention to the emerging application, this work aims to provide a comprehensive view of the processes involved to transform agricultural products into biocarbon. This review includes discussion of the lignocellulosic feedstock degradation, analysis of the pyrolysis process effects on biocarbon properties, and the emerging novel applications for biocarbon based composite materials.
