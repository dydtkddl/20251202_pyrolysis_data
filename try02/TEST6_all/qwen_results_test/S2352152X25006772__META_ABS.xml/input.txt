Biowaste-derived hierarchical activated porous carbon with heteroatom-doping (N/S) for efficient symmetrical supercapacitors: A cow urine approach The continuous accumulation of biowaste in the environment over extended periods can pose considerable ecological challenges. Hence, the conversion of natural biowaste into value-added products is essential. In this study, for the first time, carbon materials derived from cow urine, an animal waste, were explored as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). Hierarchical, highly porous carbonaceous materials containing heteroatoms such as N and S were synthesized using a simple, template-free pyrolysis method, involving the direct carbonization of cow urine as a single precursor at 700 °C (CCUR-700) and pre-KOH activation of the resulting cow urine deposit pyrolyzed at 700 °C (A-CCUR-700) with a removal of inherent mineral salts. The resulting porous carbon materials were then employed as electrode materials for SC applications. The A-CCUR-700 electrode, with its abundant surface functionalities, high specific surface area (2651.7 m2/g), high porosity, good conductivity, and self-doped heteroatoms (N and S), demonstrated better charge storage performance compared to the CCUR-700 electrode. Notably, a two-electrode symmetric SC assembled using the A-CCUR-700 electrode demonstrated an excellent specific capacitance of 165 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the A-CCUR-700 symmetric SC device achieved a high energy and power density of 22.9 Wh/kg and 5100 W/kg, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 95.3 % over 5000 cycles. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the synthesis of functionalized carbonaceous materials from cow urine may open up new possibilities for producing inexpensive electrode materials for electrochemical value-added applications.
