You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biowaste-derived hierarchical activated porous carbon with heteroatom-doping (N/S) for efficient symmetrical supercapacitors: A cow urine approach The continuous accumulation of biowaste in the environment over extended periods can pose considerable ecological challenges. Hence, the conversion of natural biowaste into value-added products is essential. In this study, for the first time, carbon materials derived from cow urine, an animal waste, were explored as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). Hierarchical, highly porous carbonaceous materials containing heteroatoms such as N and S were synthesized using a simple, template-free pyrolysis method, involving the direct carbonization of cow urine as a single precursor at 700 °C (CCUR-700) and pre-KOH activation of the resulting cow urine deposit pyrolyzed at 700 °C (A-CCUR-700) with a removal of inherent mineral salts. The resulting porous carbon materials were then employed as electrode materials for SC applications. The A-CCUR-700 electrode, with its abundant surface functionalities, high specific surface area (2651.7 m2/g), high porosity, good conductivity, and self-doped heteroatoms (N and S), demonstrated better charge storage performance compared to the CCUR-700 electrode. Notably, a two-electrode symmetric SC assembled using the A-CCUR-700 electrode demonstrated an excellent specific capacitance of 165 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the A-CCUR-700 symmetric SC device achieved a high energy and power density of 22.9 Wh/kg and 5100 W/kg, respectively, with a capacitance retention of 95.3 % over 5000 cycles. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the synthesis of functionalized carbonaceous materials from cow urine may open up new possibilities for producing inexpensive electrode materials for electrochemical value-added applications.
