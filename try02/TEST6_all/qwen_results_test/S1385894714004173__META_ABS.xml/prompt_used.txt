You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of high quality single-walled carbon nanotubes with purity enhancement and diameter control by liquid precursor Ar–H2 plasma spraying As usage of carbon nanotubes continues to increase in both scientific research and practical applications, there has been a growing interest in the large-scale synthesis of those materials with high quality and high purity. Here we report a new plasma process developed for the large-scale synthesis of high quality single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). An induction thermal plasma with a liquid precursor spraying technique was employed for an effective synthesis of SWCNTs from a mixture of toluene and ferrocene. It has been successfully demonstrated in this new process that high quality SWCNTs can be synthesized continuously with a reasonably high-purity, the structural quality of the materials produced being comparable to those of SWCNTs produced from the laser vaporization process. The high temperature of the plasma, over 4000K, seems to be responsible for the production of high quality SWCNTs and the rapid treatment of a large amount of feedstock, whereas the hydrogen plasma contributes to the purity enhancement by selective etching of amorphous carbon. It is also found that the diameter distribution of SWCNTs can be controlled effectively by varying the sulfur content in the feedstock mixture, which is very promising for many advanced applications of SWCNTs such as SWCNT-based electronics.
