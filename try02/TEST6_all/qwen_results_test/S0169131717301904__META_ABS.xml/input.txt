Water-based synthesis of TiO2/CeO2 composites supported on plasma-treated montmorillonite for parathion methyl degradation The undemanding water-based synthesis was employed for the preparation of TiO2/CeO2 composites supported on Montmorillonite (MT). The prior plasma treatment of Montmorillonite led to significantly faster dispergation in water during the synthesis. The composites were used as reactive adsorbents against toxic organophosphorus pesticide parathion methyl. Efficient pillaring of the Montmorillonite layers by surface deposition of TiO2/CeO2 composites reflected in a substantially improved degradation activity towards parathion methyl in non-polar (heptane) and polar solvents (acetonitrile) investigated by HPLC/DAD. Moreover, the use of plasma treated Montmorillonite in the composites resulted in a higher degradation rate than with use of pristine MT. The formation of composites and their physicochemical properties were studied by XRD, XPS, FTIR, nitrogen physisorption, SEM and HRTEM/EDS mapping. Prior plasma treatment of the MT in a simple arrangement led to an easier formation of the composites and caused further improvement of the samples activity.
