You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Water-based synthesis of TiO2/CeO2 composites supported on plasma-treated montmorillonite for parathion methyl degradation The undemanding water-based synthesis was employed for the preparation of TiO2/CeO2 composites supported on Montmorillonite (MT). The prior plasma treatment of Montmorillonite led to significantly faster dispergation in water during the synthesis. The composites were used as reactive adsorbents against toxic organophosphorus pesticide parathion methyl. Efficient pillaring of the Montmorillonite layers by surface deposition of TiO2/CeO2 composites reflected in a substantially improved degradation activity towards parathion methyl in non-polar (heptane) and polar solvents (acetonitrile) investigated by HPLC/DAD. Moreover, the use of plasma treated Montmorillonite in the composites resulted in a higher degradation rate than with use of pristine MT. The formation of composites and their physicochemical properties were studied by XRD, XPS, FTIR, nitrogen physisorption, SEM and HRTEM/EDS mapping. Prior plasma treatment of the MT in a simple arrangement led to an easier formation of the composites and caused further improvement of the samples activity.
