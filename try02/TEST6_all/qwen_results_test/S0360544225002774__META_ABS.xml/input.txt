Microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood and polypropylene for hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil based on multilayer MFI nanosheets catalysis This research examined the microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood (EW) and polypropylene (PP) to obtain hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil utilizing hydrogen-type multilayer MFI nanosheets (HMMN) catalysts. Firstly, the catalytic properties of HMMN and HZSM-5 in microwave field were compared. Compared with HZSM-5, the proportion of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in products catalyzed by HMMN increased by 5.5 times, and the proportion of oxygenates reduced by 67 %. Secondly, the influence of catalytic temperature and catalyst dosage on the yields and composition of bio-oil was investigated under the catalysis of HMMN. At a catalytic temperature of 550 °C, the greatest yields of bio-oil (25.82 wt%) and MAHs in bio-oil products (24.17 %) were obtained. Furthermore, when HMMN was added at a dosage of 150 wt%, the relative yield of MAHs reached its peak (26.16 %). Finally, the mechanism of microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of EW and PP based on HMMN catalysis was analyzed. Due to its elevated B/L value and abundant mesoporous volume, HMMN exhibited exceptional aromatization and deoxidation properties in the microwave field. Microwave field activation of free radicals generated by pyrolysis of EW and PP promotes the generation of benzene ring derivatives. HMMN catalysis in microwave field further enhances the selectivity of MAHs.
