Synergistic effect between metal and acid sites in Pd-based catalysts for hydrogenolysis of lignin-derived compounds Catalytic hydrogenolysis process efficiently leverages lignin and its derivatives for renewable fine chemical and fuel production; however, attaining high selectivity and activity for a sole product persists as a formidable hurdle. In the present study, high-efficacy catalysts incorporating a Pd-WO x active center were engineered for the hydrogenolysis of lignin and its derivative compounds. This was achieved by embedding different Pd ensembles onto the surface of WO x species. The optimum catalyst 0.5Pd-WO x demonstrated remarkable performance with regard to both activity (815.3 molDPE molPd −1 h−1) and selectivity (>99 % for either monomer or cyclohexane) under mild reaction conditions (130 °C, 2 MPa of H2). Additionally, this catalyst also exhibited a notable capacity for the conversion of other lignin-derived compounds as well as real lignin. Comprehensive studies, utilizing AC-HAADF-STEM, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, H2-TPD, in situ FT-IR and DFT calculation, reveal that Brønsted acid sites (W5+−O–H), which play a pivotal role in breaking C–O bonds, are formed in situ via hydrogen spillover from Pd to WO x . Furthermore, the superior performance of the 0.5Pd-WO x active center is attributed to the moderate interaction between the metal Pd and WO x species. This research offers an efficacious strategy for designing metal–acid catalysts applicable to the hydrogenolysis of C–O bonds in lignin and has potential implications for advancement in the catalytic conversion of biomass resources.
