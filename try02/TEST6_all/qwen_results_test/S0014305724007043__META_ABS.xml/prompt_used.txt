You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances and significances of carbon nanotube applications: A comprehensive review This review study examines the diverse applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), emphasizing their remarkable characteristics, including their cylindrical nanostructure, exceptional mechanical strength, distinctive electrical properties, and efficient thermal conductivity. These attributes contribute to the versatility of CNTs, enabling their utilization across various fields. Within the domain of electronics, (CNTs) assume a crucial function in the advancement of high-performance field effect transistors (FETs) characterized by diminished dimensions and enhanced operational velocities. Concurrently, the incorporation of these components into composite materials enhances their mechanical strength and improves their ability to control thermal energy. (CNTs) have shown significant promise in transforming energy conversion and storage technologies, such as batteries and supercapacitors, as well as enhancing the performance of photovoltaic cells in solar energy systems. Within the field of biomedicine, (CNTs) exhibit considerable potential for precise administration of drugs and genes, regenerative medicine applications, biosensing capabilities, and bioimaging techniques. However, the utilization of CNTs in these areas is not without its obstacles, including the need for effective control over their chirality, ensuring compatibility with biological systems, and achieving scalability in their production. Due to continuous progress in precise manufacturing and functionalization methodologies, (CNTs) present viable solutions to the aforementioned issues and possess the capacity to foster improvements in several technical and medicinal domains. Consequently, CNTs have emerged as a captivating field of research and inquiry.
