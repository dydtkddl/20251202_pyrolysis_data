Protein hydrogel formation from chicken processing By-Products: Exploring applications in food Chicken processing by-products, such as meat left over on bones, skin, frames and connective tissues, are great sources of functional proteins that offer significant potential for value-added applications, contributing to both waste reduction and environmental sustainability. By transforming the recovered proteins from by-products into hydrogels, new materials can be developed for use in various industries, including food. However, understanding the chemical composition of these by-products and optimizing hydrogel production techniques are critical to producing hydrogels with desirable properties. This review examines the latest techniques for isolating proteins from chicken by-products and transforming them into functional hydrogels. It highlights methods of hydrogel preparation, crosslinking, and characterization, with a focus on their conformational properties and applications in food systems. The review also addresses the current scope of health benefits and future potential of these hydrogels in enhancing food product quality. Advances in protein extraction and hydrogel formation show that these hydrogels can retain water, improve gelation, and maintain stability, making them ideal for food products. Specifically, they can be used as edible coatings in fried foods to reduce fat uptake and limit the formation of harmful compounds. Chicken protein-based hydrogels hold great potential for future food processing applications, promoting sustainability and consumer well-being.
