You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Protein hydrogel formation from chicken processing By-Products: Exploring applications in food Chicken processing by-products, such as meat left over on bones, skin, frames and connective tissues, are great sources of functional proteins that offer significant potential for value-added applications, contributing to both waste reduction and environmental sustainability. By transforming the recovered proteins from by-products into hydrogels, new materials can be developed for use in various industries, including food. However, understanding the chemical composition of these by-products and optimizing hydrogel production techniques are critical to producing hydrogels with desirable properties. This review examines the latest techniques for isolating proteins from chicken by-products and transforming them into functional hydrogels. It highlights methods of hydrogel preparation, crosslinking, and characterization, with a focus on their conformational properties and applications in food systems. The review also addresses the current scope of health benefits and future potential of these hydrogels in enhancing food product quality. Advances in protein extraction and hydrogel formation show that these hydrogels can retain water, improve gelation, and maintain stability, making them ideal for food products. Specifically, they can be used as edible coatings in fried foods to reduce fat uptake and limit the formation of harmful compounds. Chicken protein-based hydrogels hold great potential for future food processing applications, promoting sustainability and consumer well-being.
