You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Macroalgal biochar synthesis and its implication on membrane fouling mitigation in fluidized bed membrane bioreactor for wastewater treatment The intensification of biochar into fluidized bed membrane bioreactor was investigated to mitigate membrane fouling. Different biochars from algal biomass were produced and used as biomaterials for wastewater treatment. In this study, different macroalgal biochar was synthesized at different pyrolysis temperatures and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer Emmett-Teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques to implicate their effect on membrane fouling reduction in fluidized bed membrane bioreactor. The combined effect of macroalgal biochars and biocarriers with gas sparging was evaluated for fouling mitigation. Macroalgal biochar curtailed membrane fouling effectively at low gas sparging rate. Transmembrane pressure (TMP) was reduced to 0.053 bar; under the fluidization of biochar-650 and biocarriers with gas sparging; from 0.27 bar (gas sparging only). Combined effect of gas sparging, biocarriers and biochar-650 instigated 92.1% fouling reduction in comparative to gas sparging alone. Mechanical scouring driven by biocarriers could reduce fouling due to removing surface deposit of foulants from membrane surface effectively and biochar can efficiently adsorb foulants because of its active functional groups resulting in reduction of colloidal fouling. The addition of divalent ions (Ca2+) further enhanced the fouling reduction in fluidized bed membrane bioreactor.
