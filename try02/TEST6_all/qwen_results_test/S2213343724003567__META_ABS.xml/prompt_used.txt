You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste using metal-incorporated activated carbons for monomer recovery and carbon nanotube synthesis As the global plastic waste crisis intensifies, innovative and sustainable solutions are urgently needed. This study evaluated waste-derived metal-incorporated activated carbon (AC) catalysts for the pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste to generate value-added products, focusing on product yield distribution, composition, hydrogen, and carbon nanotube (CNT) formation. Pyrolysis-catalysis experiments were conducted using a two-stage fixed-bed reactor, wherein the temperature was maintained at 500 °C in first stage (pyrolysis) and varied (500, 600, and 700 °C) in the second stage (catalysis). The tested ACs were incorporated with nickel (Ni-AC), iron (Fe-AC), and zinc (Zn-AC) to assess the impact of metal particles distributed on the carbonaceous support in the second stage. The results from the ACs were compared to those obtained using zeolite (H-ZSM-5), Raw-AC, and non-catalytic runs. The Ni-AC and Fe-AC demonstrated superior catalytic activity, with Ni-AC being more efficient in producing hydrogen (4.24 wt%) and CNTs (34.5 wt%) with diameters of approximately 30 nm, and Fe-AC leading to higher gas yields (68.8 wt%) and CNTs (12.4 wt%) of around 60 nm. In contrast, Zn-AC and Raw-AC presented limited effectiveness, although Raw-AC moderately outperformed Zn-AC with enhanced gas yields and reduced oil/wax yields. The zeolite H-ZSM-5 exhibited the highest gas yields (78 wt%), converting heavy fractions into lighter molecules, notably the monomers ethylene and propylene. These findings provide valuable insights into catalyst selection and optimization for plastic waste pyrolysis processes, with H-ZSM-5 being the most effective catalyst for monomer recovery, and Ni-AC and Fe-AC demonstrating promising results.
