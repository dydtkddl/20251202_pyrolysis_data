Process innovations in catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for sustainable conversion: A review on economical approach The catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is a highly promising route toward biofuels and other value-added bio-based chemicals, meeting the urgent demand for renewable energy and sustainable materials. The formation of value-added products through the thermal degradation of biomass and solid reactors with state-of-the-art catalysts that yield high value-added products with low oxygen in the form of liquid oil. Major progress has also been made in terms of developing catalysts as zeolites, metal oxides and bifunctional catalysts to increase product selectivity and efficiency. They are considered important catalysts for allowing the pathway of reaction to be optimized to minimize byproduct formation and bio-oil quality improvement. Key innovations in in process integration, including more accurate temperature management, co-feeding of other feedstocks and vapour upgrading during pyrolysis have enhanced the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of process. Reactor design advancements, such as fluidized bed reactors for improved heat transfer and scalability or fixed-bed configurations for precise control, have been explored to enhance yield and reduce operational costs. This review investigates several system and process changes that can be made to maximize catalytic pyrolysis yield and efficiency.
