A review on exploring pyrolysis potential of invasive aquatic plants The rapid spread of invasive aquatic plants poses significant ecological and economic challenges, necessitating effective management strategies. Pyrolysis, a thermochemical decomposition process in an oxygen-free environment, offers a promising solution for converting these plant-based biomass sources into biochar. Biochar, produced through the pyrolysis of organic materials in low-oxygen environments, has high carbon content, excellent resistance to degradation, and high aromaticity, making it a valuable resource for various industries, including agriculture, environment, and energy sectors and supports the circular economy. Invasive aquatic plants are widely distributed and are ideal resources for biochar production. Pyrolysis of invasive aquatic plants offers multiple benefits, including protecting ecosystems from aggressive species, promoting human health, mitigating aquatic weed proliferation, and generating other renewable energy resources. Invasive plant-derived biochar has emerged as a novel material, distinguished from traditional biochar by its unique structure and composition. This study explores the pyrolysis potential of various invasive aquatic plants by examining biochar's origins, analysing how pyrolysis conditions affect the conversion of these invasive aquatic plants, and exploring characterization methods, applications, and future potential of biochar derived from these plants. An economic analysis of biochar pyrolyzed from invasive aquatic plants is also reviewed and reported.
