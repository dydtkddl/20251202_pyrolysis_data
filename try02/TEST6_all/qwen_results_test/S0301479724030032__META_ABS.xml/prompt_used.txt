You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on exploring pyrolysis potential of invasive aquatic plants The rapid spread of invasive aquatic plants poses significant ecological and economic challenges, necessitating effective management strategies. Pyrolysis, a thermochemical decomposition process in an oxygen-free environment, offers a promising solution for converting these plant-based biomass sources into biochar. Biochar, produced through the pyrolysis of organic materials in low-oxygen environments, has high carbon content, excellent resistance to degradation, and high aromaticity, making it a valuable resource for various industries, including agriculture, environment, and energy sectors and supports the circular economy. Invasive aquatic plants are widely distributed and are ideal resources for biochar production. Pyrolysis of invasive aquatic plants offers multiple benefits, including protecting ecosystems from aggressive species, promoting human health, mitigating aquatic weed proliferation, and generating other renewable energy resources. Invasive plant-derived biochar has emerged as a novel material, distinguished from traditional biochar by its unique structure and composition. This study explores the pyrolysis potential of various invasive aquatic plants by examining biochar's origins, analysing how pyrolysis conditions affect the conversion of these invasive aquatic plants, and exploring characterization methods, applications, and future potential of biochar derived from these plants. An economic analysis of biochar pyrolyzed from invasive aquatic plants is also reviewed and reported.
