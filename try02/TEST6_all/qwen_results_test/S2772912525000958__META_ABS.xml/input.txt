E-waste management in Bangladesh: Environmental impacts, health risks, and sustainable policy strategies The management of electronic waste (e-waste) is a critical issue, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh, where infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are often inadequate. Recent estimates indicate that Bangladesh generated approximately 367 million kilograms (367,000 metric tons) of e-waste in 2024, equating to 2.2 kg per capita annually (0.006 kg/person/day), with e-waste constituting 2.3 % of municipal solid waste (MSW). Notably, shipbreaking activities—a major contributor—add an additional 2.5 million metric tons of e-waste annually, though this is often excluded from domestic estimates. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current e-waste management scenario in Bangladesh, highlighting both the environmental and health hazards associated with improper disposal practices. The study examines novel e-waste treatment technologies, including mechanochemical treatment, hydrothermal processes, pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrocracking, to determine their feasibility in the region. Furthermore, it reviews e-waste components and hazardous substances, emphasizing the environmental and health impacts, particularly on vulnerable populations such as children and informal sector workers. The paper also examines existing e-waste management policies and legislation in Bangladesh, identifying gaps and suggesting improvements based on international best practices. It underscores the potential for resource recovery from e-waste, contributing to the circular economy, and discusses the economic benefits of effective e-waste management, including job creation and the development of a sustainable recycling industry. Finally, the study offers actionable recommendations for policymakers and practitioners aimed at enhancing e-waste management practices in Bangladesh, thus promoting a safer and more sustainable environment. Through this focused analysis, the paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on e-waste management and provide insights that can help bridge the gap between Bangladesh and more developed nations in terms of e-waste handling and regulatory frameworks.
