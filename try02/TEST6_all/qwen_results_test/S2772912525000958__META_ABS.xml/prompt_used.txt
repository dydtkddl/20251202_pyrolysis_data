You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

E-waste management in Bangladesh: Environmental impacts, health risks, and sustainable policy strategies The management of electronic waste (e-waste) is a critical issue, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh, where infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are often inadequate. Recent estimates indicate that Bangladesh generated approximately 367 million kilograms (367,000 metric tons) of e-waste in 2024, equating to 2.2 kg per capita annually (0.006 kg/person/day), with e-waste constituting 2.3 % of municipal solid waste (MSW). Notably, shipbreaking activities—a major contributor—add an additional 2.5 million metric tons of e-waste annually, though this is often excluded from domestic estimates. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current e-waste management scenario in Bangladesh, highlighting both the environmental and health hazards associated with improper disposal practices. The study examines novel e-waste treatment technologies, including mechanochemical treatment, hydrothermal processes, pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrocracking, to determine their feasibility in the region. Furthermore, it reviews e-waste components and hazardous substances, emphasizing the environmental and health impacts, particularly on vulnerable populations such as children and informal sector workers. The paper also examines existing e-waste management policies and legislation in Bangladesh, identifying gaps and suggesting improvements based on international best practices. It underscores the potential for resource recovery from e-waste, contributing to the circular economy, and discusses the economic benefits of effective e-waste management, including job creation and the development of a sustainable recycling industry. Finally, the study offers actionable recommendations for policymakers and practitioners aimed at enhancing e-waste management practices in Bangladesh, thus promoting a safer and more sustainable environment. Through this focused analysis, the paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on e-waste management and provide insights that can help bridge the gap between Bangladesh and more developed nations in terms of e-waste handling and regulatory frameworks.
