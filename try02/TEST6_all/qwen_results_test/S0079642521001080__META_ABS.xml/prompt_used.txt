You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on planar boron nitride nanomaterials: From 2D nanosheets towards 0D quantum dots Moving from two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D h-BN) flatlands towards their quantum sized zero-dimensional (0D) islands, as the newest member of the h-BN family, has recently opened up novel research areas due to the emergence of unique optical and physicochemical properties, excellent thermal and chemical stability, and desirable biocompatibility. This review elaborates on the fundamental properties of 2D and 0D h-BN nanomaterials and covers the latest progress in the fabrication and applications of BN nanosheets (BNNSs) and quantum dots (BNQDs). Initially, the transformation of properties in h-BN nanomaterials is discussed when moving from the 2D realm towards the 0D quantum zone. Then, top-down and bottom-up synthesis methods of 2D h-BN are reviewed, analyzing each method’s advantages and shortcomings. The review will continue explaining the fabrication methods of BNQDs and the impact of synthesis technique on their physiochemical characteristics. Special attention is given to surface chemistry of BNQD nanocrystals that can alter their electronic band structure and optoelectronic properties. Thereafter, detailed discussion on the implementation of BNNSs and BNQDs in various applications, e.g., catalysts, sensors, bioimaging probes, proton exchange membranes, and photocatalytic activators, is provided. At last, an overview of the ongoing challenges and future directions for BNQD research is presented.
