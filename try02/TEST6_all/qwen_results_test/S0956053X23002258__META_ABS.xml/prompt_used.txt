You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a novel induction-heated reactor to enhance the performance of waste tires pyrolysis Waste tire pyrolysis (WTP) is well-known as a promising technique for waste tires (WTs) management. However, the requirements of high cost and intense energy, as well as steel wire stripping remain the major drawbacks for the widespread applications of WTP technologies. In this research, a novel induction-heated pyrolysis (IHP) reactor has been developed to enhance the performance of WTP and the results were compared with a conventional fixed bed pyrolysis (FBP) reactor. The performance of the IHP reactor has been evaluated using three different feedstocks of sidewall (no steel wire), tread section (20% steel wire), and real mode (14% steel wire) at two different sizes of A and B. The results revealed that the presence of steel wire in the IHP reactor not only reduced the effect of WTs particles size, but also improved the average heat and oil production rate up to 36 % and 60 %, respectively through better heat distribution. The minimum REC (13.03 KJ/g) was achieved for the tread section after 12 min of the IHP process. The comparison of the results of the IHP reactor and the FBP reactor proved that using IHP reactor could significantly improve the performance WTP in terms of optimum heating time, heat rate, REC and power consuming cost up to 68 %, 44 %, 56 % and 61 % respectively. The findings of this study suggest IHP reactor which eliminates the need of stripping steel wires as novel and promising approach for sustainable WTs management.
