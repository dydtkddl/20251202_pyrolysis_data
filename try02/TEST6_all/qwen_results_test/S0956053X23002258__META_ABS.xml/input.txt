Development of a novel induction-heated reactor to enhance the performance of waste tires pyrolysis Waste tire pyrolysis (WTP) is well-known as a promising technique for waste tires (WTs) management. However, the requirements of high cost and intense energy, as well as steel wire stripping remain the major drawbacks for the widespread applications of WTP technologies. In this research, a novel induction-heated pyrolysis (IHP) reactor has been developed to enhance the performance of WTP and the results were compared with a conventional fixed bed pyrolysis (FBP) reactor. The performance of the IHP reactor has been evaluated using three different feedstocks of sidewall (no steel wire), tread section (20% steel wire), and real mode (14% steel wire) at two different sizes of A and B. The results revealed that the presence of steel wire in the IHP reactor not only reduced the effect of WTs particles size, but also improved the average heat and oil production rate up to 36 % and 60 %, respectively through better heat distribution. The minimum REC (13.03 KJ/g) was achieved for the tread section after 12 min of the IHP process. The comparison of the results of the IHP reactor and the FBP reactor proved that using IHP reactor could significantly improve the performance WTP in terms of optimum heating time, heat rate, REC and power consuming cost up to 68 %, 44 %, 56 % and 61 % respectively. The findings of this study suggest IHP reactor which eliminates the need of stripping steel wires as novel and promising approach for sustainable WTs management.
