You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Essential strategies for efficient low–tar biomass gasification: in-bed intensification and interactive two–stage reactions Gasification is a highly effective technology for converting biomass into fuel gas or syngas. While various gasifiers have been commercialized for fuel gas production, mitigating tar formation in gasifiers remains challenging. This review is devoted to summarizing the general strategies adopted in various gasifiers to reduce tar formation for high-efficiency clean gasification. For single-bed and staged-gasification processes, their low-tar strategies are typically different. In the single-bed processes, the low-tar strategies involve in-bed intensification achieved by controlling flow directions of gas and particles inside the gasifier. During the gasification, these two components often have different temperatures to facilitate thermochemical interactions between them. Meanwhile, the two-stage gasifiers are generally designed to decouple pyrolysis, gasification and tar cracking reactions for maximizing the benefits (such as yield and efficiency) realized from the interactions among these reactions. In addition to minimizing tar formation, the approach of reaction decoupling can also raise the calorific value of product gas, even without use of oxygen, and/or improve the adaptability of gasification technology to the feedstocks with various moisture contents and particle sizes. The reanalysis based on those essential low-tar strategies is expected to gain alternative insights into the reaction principles implicated in most advanced biomass gasification technologies.
