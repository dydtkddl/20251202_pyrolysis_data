You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxygen vacancy mediated oxidative reforming of polylactic acid to hydrocarbon Degradable plastic, while attractive, pose environmental risks due to easy microplastics production. This study targets converting degradable plastics into high-value chemicals to address plastic pollution and resource utilization. Improving product selectivity during oxide species-modulated plastic conversion remains challenging in Fenton-like processes. We propose a singlet oxygen (1O2)-driven strategy for selective polylactic acid (PLA) conversion to hydrocarbons. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) is activated by Cu-Mg co-doped 3D nickel sulfides with oxygen vacancies. More vacancies lower the O-O bond breakage energy in PMS and enhance 1O2 generation. As designed, Cα-O sites of PLA are electrophilicly attacked by 1O2. 1O2 provides suitable energy for hydrogen extraction from tertiary Cα-H and methyl C-H, generating vital R-COO• and R•. Hydrocarbons are formed after CO2 removal from R-COO•. 1O2-initiated radicals generation overcomes key barriers in PLA conversion. Impressively, Techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) suggest that the process can effectively reduce carbon emissions and provide favorable economic benefits. This hydrothermal oxidation process is expected to solve the issues of environmental pollution and carbon waste caused by PLA. The present development has great potential for recycling of carbon resources with a negligible environmental footprint.
