You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Architectural design of multidimensional carbonaceous structures: Synergistic pathways enabling high-energy silicon-based anodes Boosting lithium-ion battery (LIB) energy density requires high-performance anodes. Breaking the capacity of graphite limits makes silicon-based (Si-based) the promising alternative, given its exceptional theoretical specific capacity. However, their industrial deployment is hindered by significant volume expansion during cycling, low intrinsic electronic conductivity, and cycling degradation induced by interfacial instability. This review systematically reviews recent progress in the development of multidimensional carbonaceous backbone structures and their composite synergistic strategies. Furthermore, the synergistic regulatory mechanisms of the multidimensional carbonaceous structures on Si-based anodes are described: one-dimensional (1D) structures provide continuous electronic high-speed channels, two-dimensional (2D) structures alleviate stress through interfacial anchoring and interlayer slip, and three-dimensional (3D) structures accommodate volume expansion using a gradient porous framework. Moreover, through multidimensional complementary strategies (e.g., 1D + 2D, 2D + 3D) and interfacial coupling, multidimensional carbonaceous architectures achieve a dynamic equilibrium between enhanced electron/ion transport and the accommodation of volumetric strain. Integrated dynamic characterization and multi-scale simulations elucidate the evolution of the carbon-Si interface and the mechanisms of multiphysics coupling. Finally, future directions are proposed: scalable manufacturing, precision structural control, practical integration, and intelligent design platforms. These provide theoretical paradigms and technological pathways for transitioning Si-based anodes from fundamental research toward high-energy-density, long-cycle-life energy storage devices.
