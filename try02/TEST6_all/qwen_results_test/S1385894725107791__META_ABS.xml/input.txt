Architectural design of multidimensional carbonaceous structures: Synergistic pathways enabling high-energy silicon-based anodes Boosting lithium-ion battery (LIB) energy density requires high-performance anodes. Breaking the capacity of graphite limits makes silicon-based (Si-based) the promising alternative, given its exceptional theoretical specific capacity. However, their industrial deployment is hindered by significant volume expansion during cycling, low intrinsic electronic conductivity, and cycling degradation induced by interfacial instability. This review systematically reviews recent progress in the development of multidimensional carbonaceous backbone structures and their composite synergistic strategies. Furthermore, the synergistic regulatory mechanisms of the multidimensional carbonaceous structures on Si-based anodes are described: one-dimensional (1D) structures provide continuous electronic high-speed channels, two-dimensional (2D) structures alleviate stress through interfacial anchoring and interlayer slip, and three-dimensional (3D) structures accommodate volume expansion using a gradient porous framework. Moreover, through multidimensional complementary strategies (e.g., 1D + 2D, 2D + 3D) and interfacial coupling, multidimensional carbonaceous architectures achieve a dynamic equilibrium between enhanced electron/ion transport and the accommodation of volumetric strain. Integrated dynamic characterization and multi-scale simulations elucidate the evolution of the carbon-Si interface and the mechanisms of multiphysics coupling. Finally, future directions are proposed: scalable manufacturing, precision structural control, practical integration, and intelligent design platforms. These provide theoretical paradigms and technological pathways for transitioning Si-based anodes from fundamental research toward high-energy-density, long-cycle-life energy storage devices.
