You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast pyrolysis of Enteromorpha prolifera model compounds for syngas: A simulated and experimental study The large-scale blooming of Enteromorpha prolifera (EP) results in "green tide," triggering significant environmental issues. However, EP as algal biomass can be converted to syngas through fast pyrolysis. This research investigates the fast pyrolysis of modeled compounds of EP for syngas production. Rhamnose (Rha), glucuronic acid (GlcA), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), and alanine (Ala) are used as the model compounds. This study employs experiments and simulations on fast pyrolysis processes. The results reveal that polysaccharide sulfate (PS) undergoes various reactions, including glycosidic bond cleavage, pyran ring opening, dehydration, and C-C bond cleavage. Simultaneously, amino acids experience dehydration, deamination, decarboxylation, and decarboxylation reactions. Fast co-pyrolysis of modeled compounds of EP, the monosaccharides and uronic acid molecules produced by PS pyrolysis also attack each other with amino acid molecules to produce other substances. The pyrolysis gas obtained from the model compounds of PS exhibits the highest CO content. Notably, amino acids possess a superior capability to produce H2 compared with PS. With the fast co-pyrolysis of EP model compounds, the CO2 content increases while the CO content decreases. This study provides a theoretical basis for the fast pyrolysis of EP to produce syngas.
