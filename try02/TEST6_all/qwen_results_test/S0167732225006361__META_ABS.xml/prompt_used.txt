You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of sustainable hydrogels from poly(ethylene terephthalate) chemical recycling products with adsorption capacity for cationic crystal violet dye This study investigates the synthesis of hydrogels from chemical recycling products of polyethylene terephthalate, crosslinked with citric acid, for application in wastewater treatment. The hydrogels were evaluated for their ability to remove the cationic dye crystal violet from aqueous solutions, achieving up to 90 % adsorption at an initial concentration of 10 mg L−1 without pH adjustment. The influence of pH was investigated, revealing that higher pH enhanced the adsorption efficiency, reaching 64.6 % removal within 30 min. Adsorption behavior was best described by the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model and was found to be spontaneous across all tested temperatures (negative ΔG° at 30 °C, 40 °C, and 45 °C). The process was predominantly driven by physisorption, as indicated by ΔH° = 10.82 kJ mol−1. Kinetic studies showed that the pseudo-second-order model best described the adsorption mechanism, emphasizing the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and the multi-step nature of the process, including intraparticle diffusion and electrostatic interactions. These findings demonstrate the potential of waste PET-derived hydrogels as sustainable materials for dye removal, contributing to solid waste reduction and water resource conservation.
