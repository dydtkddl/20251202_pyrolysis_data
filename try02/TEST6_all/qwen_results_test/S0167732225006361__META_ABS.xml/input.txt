Production of sustainable hydrogels from poly(ethylene terephthalate) chemical recycling products with adsorption capacity for cationic crystal violet dye This study investigates the synthesis of hydrogels from chemical recycling products of polyethylene terephthalate, crosslinked with citric acid, for application in wastewater treatment. The hydrogels were evaluated for their ability to remove the cationic dye crystal violet from aqueous solutions, achieving up to 90 % adsorption at an initial concentration of 10 mg L−1 without pH adjustment. The influence of pH was investigated, revealing that higher pH enhanced the adsorption efficiency, reaching 64.6 % removal within 30 min. Adsorption behavior was best described by the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model and was found to be spontaneous across all tested temperatures (negative ΔG° at 30 °C, 40 °C, and 45 °C). The process was predominantly driven by physisorption, as indicated by ΔH° = 10.82 kJ mol−1. Kinetic studies showed that the pseudo-second-order model best described the adsorption mechanism, emphasizing the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and the multi-step nature of the process, including intraparticle diffusion and electrostatic interactions. These findings demonstrate the potential of waste PET-derived hydrogels as sustainable materials for dye removal, contributing to solid waste reduction and water resource conservation.
