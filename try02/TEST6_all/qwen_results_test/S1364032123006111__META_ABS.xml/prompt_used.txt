You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical conversion of biomass: Potential future prospects The thermochemical conversion of biomass is potentially vital to meeting global demand for sustainable transport fuels so besides combustion; torrefaction, liquefaction, pyrolysis and gasification are reviewed. The merits and demerits of these processes and examples of industrial applications are evaluated, and two promising avenues for future development are identified. The future of biomass upgrading via thermochemical processing will depend on sector coupling, both within the energy sector and with sectors such as food production. Owing to environmental constraints and the need to maintain food production, the availability of traditional feedstocks for biofuels, such as corn, will be limited in the future. Now given the ambitious targets for sustainable aviation fuel – a higher quality fuel – reserving appropriate feedstocks for aviation fuel will be necessary. Such a policy would open opportunities for the commercial development of the sustainable production of such liquid fuels via liquefaction and pyrolysis. The second avenue of opportunity links to the fact that biomass in the form of wooden pellets has established itself as an essential fuel. In the UK and elsewhere, it is already contributing to the decarbonisation of the electricity grids. So worldwide, a positive future for biomass combustion, aided where appropriate by torrefaction, is envisaged as increasingly crucial for the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. Alongside battery storage and pumped hydroelectric storage, the contribution of biomass processes, such as torrefaction, to tackling the storage problem arising from the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy has been clarified for the first time.
