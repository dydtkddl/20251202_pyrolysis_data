Influence of distillates (petroleum) on microcrystalline cellulose pyrolysis Porous materials have received extensive attention due to their superior adsorption properties, but there are few studies on oil adsorption. In this paper, a new self-design high-temperature reactor carried out MCC adsorption experiments, and a complete test system was used to study the adsorption characteristics, pyrolysis kinetics and pyrolysis products. The results of SEM and XRD showed that G3H gradually wetted the surface of MCC and the crystallinity increased. In addition, the pyrolysis parameters of MCC-adsorption-G3H (MAG) were measured by DSC and STA. The results showed that MCC was pyrolyzed in one step while MAG was in two. Meanwhile, thermodynamic model fitting indicated that the first stage was Fn and the second was Cnm autocatalytic. Notably, the variation of pyrolysis activation energy in the first stage was similar to that of adsorption capacity. Pyrolysis products of G3H were measured by Py-GC-MS, and pyrolysis residues of MAG were tested by FTIR. Combined with the volatiles determined by TG-IR, the influence of G3H on the pyrolysis characteristics was obtained, and the pyrolysis path of MAG was summarized. The results showed that porous materials can recycle oil and provided a guideline for industrial production.
