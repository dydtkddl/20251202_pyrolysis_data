You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of distillates (petroleum) on microcrystalline cellulose pyrolysis Porous materials have received extensive attention due to their superior adsorption properties, but there are few studies on oil adsorption. In this paper, a new self-design high-temperature reactor carried out MCC adsorption experiments, and a complete test system was used to study the adsorption characteristics, pyrolysis kinetics and pyrolysis products. The results of SEM and XRD showed that G3H gradually wetted the surface of MCC and the crystallinity increased. In addition, the pyrolysis parameters of MCC-adsorption-G3H (MAG) were measured by DSC and STA. The results showed that MCC was pyrolyzed in one step while MAG was in two. Meanwhile, thermodynamic model fitting indicated that the first stage was Fn and the second was Cnm autocatalytic. Notably, the variation of pyrolysis activation energy in the first stage was similar to that of adsorption capacity. Pyrolysis products of G3H were measured by Py-GC-MS, and pyrolysis residues of MAG were tested by FTIR. Combined with the volatiles determined by TG-IR, the influence of G3H on the pyrolysis characteristics was obtained, and the pyrolysis path of MAG was summarized. The results showed that porous materials can recycle oil and provided a guideline for industrial production.
