Development of integrated reactive system based on co-combustion of wood biomass and plastic: Efficient hydrogen and methane production Green energy produced from waste plastic and wood biomass was an effective way to promote sustainable development. To improve the utilization efficiency of solid waste, a novel porous media co-combustion system of plastic and wood was designed. The combustion characteristics and product concentration of the mixture were investigated for different parameters. The results indicated that the increase of air velocity increased the combustion temperature, and the hydrogen production reached the maximum at v = 12 cm/s. The syngas yield increased first and then decreased with increasing plastic content, and polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) promoted methane production. Moreover, hydrogen concentration gradually increased with increasing inert bed length. Syngas production increased with increasing plastic size, and the methane concentration of spherical plastics was 242.61% higher than that of Raschig ring plastics. The corresponding research results provided a theoretical reference for the bioenergy utilization of solid waste.
