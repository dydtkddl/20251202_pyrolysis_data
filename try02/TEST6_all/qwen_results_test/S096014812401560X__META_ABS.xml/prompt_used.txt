You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chitosan-assisted reassembled hierarchical HZSM-5 for selective production of monocyclic aromatics in catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic Biomass presents significant potential as an alternative template agent for assisting zeolites in developing new pore structure during recrystallization to enhance their catalytic performance. In this study, a new hierarchical HZSM-5 was synthesized through the in-situ reassembly of alkali-treated HZSM-5 with chitosan as an assisting agent. The impact of chitosan dosage on the catalytic performance of the hierarchical HZSM-5, as well as the influences of temperature, catalyst dosage, and corn stover (CS) to high-density polyethylene (HDPE) mass ratio on the content and selectivity of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) during the catalytic co-pyrolysis process, were thoroughly investigated. The results indicated that chitosan exhibited great potential as a template in the reassembly of hierarchical HZSM-5 during NaOH treatment, promoting the formation of weak acid sites and micro-mesoporous structures. Compared to the parent HZSM-5, the chitosan-assistant reassembled hierarchical HZSM-5 significantly enhanced the production of MAHs and inhibited the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The highest carbon yield of MAHs reached 36.9 % at 550 °C with a chitosan dosage of 15 %. Furthermore, the chitosan-modified HZSM-5 notably enhanced the synergistic production of MAHs by 38.2 %, while preventing the formation of PAHs and coke. This study contributes insights into the sustainable synthesis of hierarchical HZSM-5 for improved production of high-value products in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics.
