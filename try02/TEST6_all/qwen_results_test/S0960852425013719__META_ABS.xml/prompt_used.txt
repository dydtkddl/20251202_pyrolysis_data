You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical conversion of oil palm empty fruit bunch into fuel gas in a fluidized bed gasifier With increasing energy demand and agro-industrial waste generation, sustainable solutions for biomass valorization become essential. This study investigates the thermochemical conversion of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) in a pilot-scale fluidized bed gasifier using air, steam, and nitrogen as gasifying agents. OPEFB characterization confirmed its favorable composition for energy purposes, including high volatile matter and lignocellulosic content. Gasification experiments revealed that the choice of gasifying agent strongly influenced syngas composition and yield. Air gasification maximized CO production, reaching 0.56 g/g biomass at an equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.43. Steam gasification produced the highest hydrogen and methane yields, with up to 52 % v/v H2 and 0.05 g CH4/g biomass, which are comparable to, or even higher than, those reported elsewhere for other lignocellulosic biomasses under similar conditions. Nitrogen atmosphere suppressed oxidation and promoted moderate H2 formation. These findings demonstrate that steam is the most effective agent for hydrogen-rich syngas generation, while air favors CO production. Overall, the study highlights OPEFB as a promising feedstock for clean energy and biorefinery applications, supporting the transition toward a circular and sustainable bioeconomy.
