Thermochemical conversion of oil palm empty fruit bunch into fuel gas in a fluidized bed gasifier With increasing energy demand and agro-industrial waste generation, sustainable solutions for biomass valorization become essential. This study investigates the thermochemical conversion of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) in a pilot-scale fluidized bed gasifier using air, steam, and nitrogen as gasifying agents. OPEFB characterization confirmed its favorable composition for energy purposes, including high volatile matter and lignocellulosic content. Gasification experiments revealed that the choice of gasifying agent strongly influenced syngas composition and yield. Air gasification maximized CO production, reaching 0.56 g/g biomass at an equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.43. Steam gasification produced the highest hydrogen and methane yields, with up to 52 % v/v H2 and 0.05 g CH4/g biomass, which are comparable to, or even higher than, those reported elsewhere for other lignocellulosic biomasses under similar conditions. Nitrogen atmosphere suppressed oxidation and promoted moderate H2 formation. These findings demonstrate that steam is the most effective agent for hydrogen-rich syngas generation, while air favors CO production. Overall, the study highlights OPEFB as a promising feedstock for clean energy and biorefinery applications, supporting the transition toward a circular and sustainable bioeconomy.
