You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the occurrence, detection methods, and ecotoxicity of biodegradable microplastics in the aquatic environment: New cause for concern Biodegradable plastics (BPs) have been widely advocated as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-derived polymers, aiming to mitigate the burgeoning crisis of microplastic pollution. However, incomplete biodegradation of BPs can generate more and smaller particles, such as microplastics, which may persist in environments. Knowledge of the fate and effects of BPs, especially biodegradable microplastics, in the aquatic environment remains limited. We investigate the concentrations, detection methods, and adverse effects of biodegradable microplastics on aquatic organisms in various aquatic environments. Biodegradable microplastics, such as poly(lactic acid), polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), and poly(butylene succinate), are found in wastewater, reservoirs, and marine environments at concentrations between 0.054 and 180 μg/L. Their environmental levels are negatively correlated with their degradation capacity in water. Biodegradable microplastics adversely affect aquatic microbial communities, plant adaptability, and animal physiology, with their toxicity increasing upon degradation. This review advocates for a critical reassessment of the use, disposal, and management strategies surrounding BPs.
