You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling WEEE plastics into dehalogenated and aromatics-rich oil by hydropyrolysis over Pd-supported catalysts This work explores low-pressure catalytic hydropyrolysis for upcycling plastics from Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Three Pd-based catalysts (using Al2O3, n-ZSM-5, and SiO2 as supports) were investigated. Experiments were performed in a custom-made reactor operating at 550 °C / 350 °C in the thermal / catalytic zones, respectively, under 50 vol% H2/N2 as the carrier / reactive gas and at 6 bar. The main product was the oil fraction (yields over 65 wt%), having a high concentration of valuable aromatic hydrocarbons, coming mainly from ABS and PS polymers contained in the raw WEEE plastics. Among the three catalysts, Pd/SiO2 exhibited the best performance, sharply reducing the Cl content in the oil and achieving complete Br removal. A reference test with pure SiO2 indicated that the support alone possesses some halogen trapping capacity, although in quite lower extension than the Pd/SiO2 catalyst. The incorporation of Pd into the silica support enhanced both the oil dehalogenation and the conversion of oligomeric/heavy species, which is reflected in an increase in the GC-MS detected components. Therefore, these results denote that WEEE plastics hydropyrolysis over Pd/SiO2 catalyst is an effective treatment for the upgrading and dehalogenation of the so-produced oil fraction.
