High-entropy alloys: Atomic horizons for sustainable electrocatalytic reactions High-entropy alloy (HEA) materials have been considered as promising materials for electrocatalytic reactions, including O2, CO2, N2 and NO3 − reduction reactions (ORR, CO2RR, NRR, and NO3 −RR), and O2 and H2 evolution reactions (OER and HER), due to their distinctive compositions, driving exceptional stability and performance through four key phenomena—high entropy, sluggish diffusion, severe lattice distortion, and the cocktail effect. These phenomena synergistically enhance the properties of HEA materials. Despite their impressive potential in electrocatalysis, HEAs face significant hurdles, including limited insight into their long-term stability, challenges in property optimization, complex microstructures, and issues with manufacturing consistency, cost, and scalability, all of which hinder their full integration at practical level. Therefore, to unlock the full potential of HEAs, a comprehensive and rigorous quantitative assessment is imperative. This evaluation must delve into the core scientific and engineering principles of HEAs, exploring their physico-chemical and electrochemical properties, addressing inherent challenges, and identifying key future prospects for their advancement.
