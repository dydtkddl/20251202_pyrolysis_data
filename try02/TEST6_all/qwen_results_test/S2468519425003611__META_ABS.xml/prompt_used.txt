You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-entropy alloys: Atomic horizons for sustainable electrocatalytic reactions High-entropy alloy (HEA) materials have been considered as promising materials for electrocatalytic reactions, including O2, CO2, N2 and NO3 − reduction reactions (ORR, CO2RR, NRR, and NO3 −RR), and O2 and H2 evolution reactions (OER and HER), due to their distinctive compositions, driving exceptional stability and performance through four key phenomena—high entropy, sluggish diffusion, severe lattice distortion, and the cocktail effect. These phenomena synergistically enhance the properties of HEA materials. Despite their impressive potential in electrocatalysis, HEAs face significant hurdles, including limited insight into their long-term stability, challenges in property optimization, complex microstructures, and issues with manufacturing consistency, cost, and scalability, all of which hinder their full integration at practical level. Therefore, to unlock the full potential of HEAs, a comprehensive and rigorous quantitative assessment is imperative. This evaluation must delve into the core scientific and engineering principles of HEAs, exploring their physico-chemical and electrochemical properties, addressing inherent challenges, and identifying key future prospects for their advancement. In response to this demand, this review is meticulously crafted to unveil the fundamental principles, phase structures, synthesis techniques, and key characteristics of these materials. It offers an in-depth exploration of the scientific mechanisms underlying HEA formation and the engineering strategies employed to optimize their properties. Additionally, this review critically examines both experimental and theoretical progress, highlighting the promising performance of HEAs in electrocatalysis. The challenges inherent to HEA engineering, characterization, and electrochemical performance are thoroughly assessed while providing a forward-looking perspective on their future development. This comprehensive analysis is intended to serve as a valuable resource for new readers, academicians, researchers, and industry professionals.
