You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Generalized model of n-heptane pyrolysis and steam cracking kinetics based on automated reaction network generation Mathematical model of n-heptane pyrolysis under thermal cracking and steam cracking conditions was developed. The objective was achieving good generalization by combining two different data sources for model identification. The data sources included experimental pyrolysis data for many structurally different hydrocarbons measured at reference conditions as well as the data for n-heptane measured in different reactors at different reaction conditions. The model was developed using the automated reaction network generation. The generated network included hydrogen abstraction, β-scission, radical isomerization and recombination reactions, the kinetic parameters of which were expressed as functions of 26 group contribution factors. Molecular reactions and radical additions were substituted by 12 formal shortcut molecular reactions. The initial values of kinetic parameters and group contribution factors were adopted from previous study, where they were obtained by regression based on the experimental data involving wide range of linear, branched and/or cyclic hydrocarbons. More experimental data on n-heptane pyrolysis measured under different conditions, including the use of two different reactors, were added to the data set used for the parameter optimization. The model simulations showed good agreement with the experimental data even for the validation samples. Thus, the proposed approach proved the ability to produce models achieving good generalization.
