Surface morphology engineering of triboelectric nanogenerators for performance enhancement Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a transformative technology for harvesting ambient mechanical energy. However, their practical application is often constrained by their electrical output performance. Surface morphology engineering has been identified as a critical strategy to overcome this limitation by maximizing charge generation and transfer at the triboelectric interface. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advances in enhancing TENG performance through the deliberate control of surface morphology, highlighting the central role of chemical engineering principles. We critically examine the roles of various materials including metals, ceramics, and polymers, and elucidate how their surface properties influence device output. Furthermore, we categorize and analyze key fabrication processes (e.g., chemical, physical, and hybrid) and structural designs (e.g., micro, nano, and hierarchical) that enable precise morphological control. Finally, we discuss emerging research trends, identify persistent challenges, and offer future prospects for the development of high-performance, mechanically robust TENGs for next-generation applications in wearable electronics, self-powered sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This review aims to provide a strategic guide, from a chemical engineering perspective, for the rational design of advanced TENGs based on a fundamental understanding of molecular-level interfacial engineering.
