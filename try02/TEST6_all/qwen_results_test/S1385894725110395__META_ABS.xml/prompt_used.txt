You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface morphology engineering of triboelectric nanogenerators for performance enhancement Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a transformative technology for harvesting ambient mechanical energy. However, their practical application is often constrained by their electrical output performance. Surface morphology engineering has been identified as a critical strategy to overcome this limitation by maximizing charge generation and transfer at the triboelectric interface. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advances in enhancing TENG performance through the deliberate control of surface morphology, highlighting the central role of chemical engineering principles. We critically examine the roles of various materials including metals, ceramics, and polymers, and elucidate how their surface properties influence device output. Furthermore, we categorize and analyze key fabrication processes (e.g., chemical, physical, and hybrid) and structural designs (e.g., micro, nano, and hierarchical) that enable precise morphological control. Finally, we discuss emerging research trends, identify persistent challenges, and offer future prospects for the development of high-performance, mechanically robust TENGs for next-generation applications in wearable electronics, self-powered sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This review aims to provide a strategic guide, from a chemical engineering perspective, for the rational design of advanced TENGs based on a fundamental understanding of molecular-level interfacial engineering.
