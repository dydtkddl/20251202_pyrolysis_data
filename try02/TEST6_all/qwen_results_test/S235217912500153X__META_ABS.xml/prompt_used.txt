You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating the microstructure of additively manufactured tungsten parts produced by electron beam powder bed fusion process Pure tungsten is one of the promising candidate materials for plasma facing components (PFC) of future fusion reactors due to several favourable properties including its high melting point, high thermal conductivity, high strength, high sputtering resistivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion. Increasing geometric complexity and productivity of tungsten PFC is of interest to improve thermal performance and availability for new tokamaks with a view to future steady state plasma operation. Additive manufacturing (AM) by the electron beam powder-bed-fusion process (EB-PBF) is identified as a potential technology to address these requirements. In this paper we reviewed the literature in EB-PBF of unalloyed tungsten to understand the role that the manufacturing parameters have in the microstructure and mechanical performance of as-printed specimens. We present targeted key research in tungsten EB-PBF process development using a modulated point melting method, post-AM hot isostatic pressing (HIP) treatment, destructive and non-destructive evaluation, microstructure control, and in-process monitoring. It was found that the modulated point melting method reduces cleavage cracking and crack nucleation points while elevated temperature HIP treatment improves the repeatability of the tensile behaviour, while mechanically healing process induced defects like solid-state cracks and nanopores.
