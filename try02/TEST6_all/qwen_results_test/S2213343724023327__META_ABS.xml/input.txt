Efficient tetracycline degradation via flow-through peroxymonosulfate activation by dual heteroatom-doped wood-derived catalytic membrane The widespread use of antibiotics in the medical industry and in animal husbandry has led to significant environmental pollution. Effective purification of high concentrations of tetracycline (TC) in practical pharmaceutical wastewater remains a substantial challenge. The integration of advanced oxidation with membrane separation technology shows great application potential. In this study, a P and N co-doped balsa wood membrane (PNWM) were fabricated using heteroatomic doped biochar material, aiming to synergize filtration and catalytic oxidation. The catalytic activity of the PNWM/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system was systematically evaluated. Targeting TC as the pollutant, the PNWM/PMS system achieved a degradation efficiency exceeding 97 % within 30 min and a total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency of 63.9 %, surpassing the performance of unmodified wood-based membrane. These excellent results were attributed to the doping of N and P atoms, which increased surface defects and specific area, thereby enhancing the adsorption and degradation of TC by PNWM. The graphite N facilitated electron transfer, while pyridine N served as active sites for PMS activation. Additionally, the low electronegativity of the P formed electronic regions of varying intensities on the PNWM surface, contributing to PMS activation. The membrane process also enhanced mass transfer during the degradation process. Both radical (·OH, SO4·ˉ, O2·ˉ) and non-radical (1O2, electron transfer) pathways cooperated in TC degradation in PNWM/PMS system. Consequently, heteroatom-doped biochar film materials prepared through simple methods provide a promising approach for the effective treatment of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater.
