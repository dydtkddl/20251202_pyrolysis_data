You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The roles of co-composted biochar (COMBI) in improving soil quality, crop productivity, and toxic metal amelioration The use of co-composted biochar (COMBI) made by the addition of biochar at the beginning of the composting process has greatly increased in agriculture during the last decade. There are more benefits of using the co-composting end product COMBI than using compost and biochar separately or the mixture of the two products. We conducted an extensive review of the production of several COMBIs and their contribution to the composting process and biochar properties as well as the further use of COMBIs in agricultural lands to improve soil health and increase crop yields, and to remediate areas severely contaminated with potentially toxic metals (PTMs). Although the number of researches focused on COMBI production and its application is so far limited, there is enough evidence to elucidate the importance of creating such products to promote sustainable agriculture and environmental safety. Even if a few drawbacks or side effects are found, they are outweighed by the many benefits achieved with COMBIs production and application in comparison to other amendments. The quality of both biochar and compost is largely improved in so many ways during the co-composting process, which in turn improved soil health and crop yields of up to 300% in some particular cases. This work improved the overall understanding of COMBI production and application in agriculture. Based on the review, we suggested future researches to better understand the mechanisms of COMBI long-term application to promote awareness on its role over time through alterations in its surface chemistry, ionic nutrient adsorption, supply (aging effect), and environmental implications.
