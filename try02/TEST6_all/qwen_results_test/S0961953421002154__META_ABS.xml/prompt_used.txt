You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing the implementation levels of oil palm waste conversion methods in Malaysia and the challenges of commercialisation: Towards sustainable energy production The conversion of oil palm waste to valuable fuels via biological and thermochemical means has witnessed much interest from researchers. Increasing tonnes of palm waste resulting from about 400 palm oil mills across Malaysia necessitates a rethink towards its conversion to energy to curb soil and air pollution, underground water contamination, and pest habitats. Converting these palm wastes to fuel at a commercial scale is necessary to advance Malaysia's bioenergy. This will ensure cleaner production and sustainability by providing low carbon energy that could be used in industrial, transport, and residential sectors. However, what is the technology readiness levels of these conversion methods in Malaysia? Have they reached commercialisation? What hinders them from attaining it? This study conducted an intensive literature review on five conversion technologies broadly classified as thermochemical (combustion, gasification and pyrolysis) and biological (anaerobic digestion and fermentation) to identify the extent to which each process has been adopted. For each of the technologies, the following were established: (1) Studies conducted by researchers using different palm wastes; (2) Challenges faced; (3) Technology readiness level. The significant findings revealed that fermentation is still at a lab scale, gasification and anaerobic digestion have reached pilot-scale while combustion and pyrolysis have attained commercialisation. Significant commercialisation challenges include technical and economic issues, communal consciousness, and stakeholder gap. Current research gaps, recommendations, future outlooks, and the way forward were discussed, along with developing a framework that features the key barriers, enablers, and stakeholders responsible for commercialisation.
