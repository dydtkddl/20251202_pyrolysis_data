You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards enhanced understanding of synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polycarbonate Utilization of biomass and plastic wastes has drawn growing attention in recent years as it offers promising pathway for simultaneous energy production and waste disposal. In this paper, the co-pyrolysis of pinewood and polycarbonate was performed in a fixed bed reactor with focus on determining the extent of synergistic effects and unraveling the underlying synergistic mechanism. The extent of synergistic effects was quantified via direct comparison of the results from co-pyrolysis of pinewood-polycarbonate mixture with the weighted average values from individual components pyrolysis. The observed synergistic effects were further deconvolved into different component interactions (such as volatiles-volatiles interactions, volatiles-feedstocks interaction, and catalytic effects of chars) using tailored feedstock configurations to gain more insights into the synergistic mechanism. The results showed that co-pyrolysis enhancedH2 by 33%, CO by 26%, and total syngas yields by 19% as compared to their weighted values from individual pyrolysis. Co-pyrolysis also exhibited superiority in energy recovery as the overall energy efficiency was noticeably promoted from 42.9% to 48.6%. Deconvolution of synergistic effects revealed that volatiles-volatiles interactions were the primary contributor for the enhancement of H2 and CO. Examination of volatiles-feedstock interactions indicated that the highly reactive pinewood volatiles facilitated polycarbonate degradation, while polycarbonate volatiles were relatively stable and unable to promote pinewood decomposition. Furthermore, pinewood char catalytically enhanced polycarbonate degradation. This paper provides a deconvolved understanding of synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and polycarbonate wastes, which is very helpful in designing clean and efficient energy recovery systems from these waste resources.
