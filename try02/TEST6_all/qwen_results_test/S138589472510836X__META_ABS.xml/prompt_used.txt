You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A hybrid machine learning and DFT-informed microkinetic model for ammonia decomposition on Ru/Al2O3 Ammonia (NH3) decomposition is a key reaction for hydrogen storage and transport applications, and its mechanistic understanding is critical for catalyst and reactor design. Microkinetic modeling enables molecular-level insight into reaction networks; however, models built purely on first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT) often suffer from quantitative inaccuracies due to the exponential sensitivity of rate expressions to small errors in activation energies. Consequently, ab initio models are typically limited to qualitative predictions. In this work, we present a hybrid modeling framework that combines DFT-informed kinetic parameters with a neural network-enhanced global optimization routine to refine a microkinetic model for ammonia decomposition over a commercial catalyst. Literature DFT values serve as initial estimates, while high-fidelity experimental data from a microreactor setup guide the fitting. Neural networks are trained as surrogates of the microkinetic model to accelerate convergence and efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space. The resulting model identifies bond scission as the rate-determining step, with scission and N2 association as additional slow steps. Surface coverage analysis reveals NH2 ∗ and H ∗ as the most abundant reaction intermediates, while N ∗ remains low. Thermodynamic consistency is enforced via partition function analysis, yielding excellent agreement with experimental enthalpies and entropies. We further extend the model to a non-interacting dual-site description, showing that terrace sites contribute negligibly under the studied conditions. This work highlights the power of integrating mechanistic microkinetic models with data-driven optimization to overcome the limitations of purely first-principles approaches. The proposed framework offers a scalable and accurate strategy for guiding catalyst design and mechanistic analysis in ammonia decomposition and related catalytic systems.
