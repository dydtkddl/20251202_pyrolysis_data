You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing RNG plant efficiency: Impact of integrating a dryer and pyrolysis unit on IRR% with biochar utilization as an additive and fertilizer This paper investigates the impact of integrating pyrolysis and drying units into traditional renewable natural gas (RNG) facilities fed by food waste, and evaluates the potential benefits of using biochar, derived from pyrolysis, as an additive to anaerobic digesters. The study aims to determine whether the capital costs associated with pyrolysis and drying units can be offset by increased methane yields due to biochar enhancement. Initial batch testing (BMP trials) showed a decrease in methane yield with biochar addition, attributed to unacclimatized bacteria. To further investigate, semi-continuous trials were conducted, revealing that biochar-enhanced digesters (BC10) exhibited an initial decrease in methane production, followed by significant improvements over time. After three hydraulic retention time (HRT) cycles, the average methane yield in BC10 digesters reached 260.68 Nm3/tonne VS, slightly higher than the control system (AD) at 258.48 Nm3/tonne VS. Additionally, biochar addition improved volatile solids reduction (45 % in BC10) and yielded digestate with higher levels of beneficial by-products and fewer toxic compounds. Economic analysis indicated that while the advanced facility showed a modest 3.49 % increase in methane yield, it faced higher operational costs, resulting in a lower internal rate of return (IRR) of 13.71 %, compared to 17.67 % for traditional facilities. The simple payback period for the traditional RNG facility was approximately 5.44 years, whereas the advanced facility required 6.73 years to recover its initial capital investment. The findings suggest that to surpass the IRR of traditional RNG facilities, the methane yield enhancement from biochar addition should be at least 30 %. The paper emphasizes the need for careful consideration of local market conditions and technological advancements in evaluating the financial viability of RNG projects.
