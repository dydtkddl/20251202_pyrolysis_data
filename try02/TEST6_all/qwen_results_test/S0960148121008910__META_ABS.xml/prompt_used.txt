You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behaviour, kinetics and thermodynamic data of hydrothermal carbonization–Treated pulp and paper mill sludge Organic-rich pulp and paper mill sludge (PPMS) has the potential to become a renewable carbon source for producing alternatives to fossil-based product. In this work, PPMS treated by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) was investigated based on its pyrolysis properties. The pyrolytic mechanism, kinetics data and product of the sample were studied using TG as well as pyrolysis tests in Py-GC/MS and a bench-scale reactor at 450, 550, and 650 °C. The results show that the thermal decomposition of feedstock is a two-stage reaction. The mean activation energy of the pyrolysis of HTC treated PPMS was estimated as 233.08 kJ/mol, which is higher than that of the pyrolysis of paper sludge reported before. The changes in enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs free energies from the reactants to the activated complex were estimated. The concentration of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the derived organic liquid fraction shows a positive correlation with the pyrolysis temperature. At 550 °C, the organic liquid fraction reached its highest yield at 13.7% with an oxygen level of 10.7 wt% and a higher heating value of 35.9 MJ/kg. The pyrolytic chars show that a molar ratio of O:C is less than 0.2, which shows potential for use as a carbon sink.
