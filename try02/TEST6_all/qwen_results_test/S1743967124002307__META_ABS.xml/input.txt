Comparative study of the composition and microstructural properties of semi-coke from microwave and conventional pyrolysis of low rank coal Microwave pyrolysis technology can effectively realize the clean and quality improvement of coal. In order to study the changes of each component of coal in the process of microwave pyrolysis, the d002, La, Lc, combustion reactivity and conductivity of semi-coke after pyrolysis were analyzed by using XRD, TG, conductivity meter and other testing instruments, and the infrared spectra of semi-coke after pyrolysis were finely resolved by using Origin peak-splitting technique, and the composition of the coal gas in the process of pyrolysis and its percentage content were analyzed. The composition and percentage content of gas in the pyrolysis process were analyzed and compared with conventional pyrolysis. The results showed that compared with conventional pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis can be completed at a lower temperature and microwave pyrolysis is more favorable to the release of volatile components, in which the content of CO and H2 in the gas fraction increased significantly compared with conventional pyrolysis. At the same pyrolysis temperature, the microwave semi-coke has a higher maximum combustion rate temperature than the conventional semi-coke, which is conducive to improving the thermal stability of semi-coke. The orderliness of the semi-coke increased with the increase of pyrolysis final temperature, resulting in the phenomenon of "similar graphitization". The increase in the number of carbon microcrystalline structures generates off-domain electrons, leading to a significant increase in conductivity. Meanwhile, FT-IR peak fitting analysis revealed that the R value inflection point temperature of microwave semi-coke was much lower than that of conventional semi-coke, which further proved that microwave pyrolysis could be accomplished at lower temperatures, and the C value showed a decreasing tendency with the increase of the final temperature of pyrolysis, which indicated that pyrolysis was an effective method to improve the quality of coal. The above analysis shows that compared with conventional pyrolysis, microwave can prepare high stability and high conductivity semi-coke at lower temperature.
