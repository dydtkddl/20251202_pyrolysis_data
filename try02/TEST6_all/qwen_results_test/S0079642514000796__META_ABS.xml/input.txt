One-dimensional nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructures One-dimensional nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructures (1-D NCNSs) have emerged in the past two decades as exceptionally promising nanomaterials due to their unique physical and chemical properties which enable a broad range of applications in various fields of modern technology. Recent investigations revealed that the 1-D NCNS-based materials can have a profound impact on energy conversion and storage, catalysis and electrocatalysis, sensors, electronic nanodevices, environmental protection, and biology-related applications. The aim of the present review article was to provide a comprehensive overview of scientific progress in 1-D NCNSs such as N-containing carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, e.g., single-walled (SWNCNTs), double-walled (DWNCNTs), and multi-walled NCNTs (MWNCNTs)), nanofibers (NCNFs), nanowires (NCNWs), nanorods (NCNRs), and nanohorns (NCNHs), and evaluate their future perspective. Various methods of preparation of 1-D NCNSs and their composites are summarized and discussed. The structure–properties relations of 1-D NCNSs, based on the theoretical approach and numerous relevant physico-chemical methods of characterization, were outlined. The emphasis is given to the properties of 1-D NCNSs rendered by nitrogen incorporation into the carbon matrix in order to provide deeper insight into the specific characteristics which determine materials’ performances within the specific fields of applications.
