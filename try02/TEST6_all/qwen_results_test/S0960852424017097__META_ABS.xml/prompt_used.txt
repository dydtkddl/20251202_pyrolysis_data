You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable approach to polystyrene management and bioinsecticide production: Biodegradation by Tenebrio molitor larvae co-fed with residual biomass and bioactivity of frass pyrolysis bio-oil against insect pests Tenebrio molitor has gained attention as a potential solution for plastic pollution. This study explored the biodegradation of polystyrene (PS) by mealworms co-fed with rice bran (RB) under an optimized rearing scheme. The RB co-diet significantly increased PS consumption by two-fold compared to wheat bran (WB). Additionally, RB supported mealworm growth with favorable survival and feed conversion rates. Protein content of mealworms remained unchanged with PS plus RB, while significantly increased lipid stores and improved the fatty acid profile. Frass from PS (1) and biomass (2) intake was subjected to pyrolysis. Bio-oils from frass 2 exhibited insecticidal activity against Plodia interpunctella adults and Culex pipiens pipiens larvae. Finally, bio-oils demonstrated low toxicity to the aquatic non-target species Artemia salina, with up to three-fold selectivity towards Cx. p. pipiens. These findings highlight RB’s role in PS management and the potential application of bio-oil as bioinsecticide.
