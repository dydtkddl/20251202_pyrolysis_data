Elimination of microplastics, PFAS, and PPCPs from biosolids via pyrolysis to produce biochar: Feasibility and techno-economic analysis Biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment contain many contaminants of emerging concern, including microplastics (MPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and chemicals from personal care products (PPCPs). Many of these contaminants have very slow biotic or abiotic degradation rates and have been shown to have human and ecological health impacts. Application of biosolids to agriculture, a common disposal method, can result in extended environmental contamination. An approach for eliminating the contaminants is pyrolysis, which can also generate biochar, enhancing carbon sequestration as a side-benefit. We pyrolyzed biosolid samples from an operating facility at various temperatures from 400 to 700 °C with a 2-hour residence time. We then evaluated contaminant removal, which in many cases was 100 %, with only a few residuals. No trace of PFAS was detectable even at 400 °C. Overall mass removal of PPCPs, including PFAS, was over 99.9 %. MP removal via pyrolysis ranged from 91 to 97 %. The biochar contains significant amounts of Fe and P, which make it a useful fertilizer amendment. The techno-economic analysis indicates that pyrolysis may generate significant cost savings, and revenue from the sale of biochar, sufficient to more than cover the investment and operating costs of the dryer and pyrolysis unit.
