You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Elimination of microplastics, PFAS, and PPCPs from biosolids via pyrolysis to produce biochar: Feasibility and techno-economic analysis Biosolids from municipal wastewater treatment contain many contaminants of emerging concern, including microplastics (MPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and chemicals from personal care products (PPCPs). Many of these contaminants have very slow biotic or abiotic degradation rates and have been shown to have human and ecological health impacts. Application of biosolids to agriculture, a common disposal method, can result in extended environmental contamination. An approach for eliminating the contaminants is pyrolysis, which can also generate biochar, enhancing carbon sequestration as a side-benefit. We pyrolyzed biosolid samples from an operating facility at various temperatures from 400 to 700 °C with a 2-hour residence time. We then evaluated contaminant removal, which in many cases was 100 %, with only a few residuals. No trace of PFAS was detectable even at 400 °C. Overall mass removal of PPCPs, including PFAS, was over 99.9 %. MP removal via pyrolysis ranged from 91 to 97 %. The biochar contains significant amounts of Fe and P, which make it a useful fertilizer amendment. The techno-economic analysis indicates that pyrolysis may generate significant cost savings, and revenue from the sale of biochar, sufficient to more than cover the investment and operating costs of the dryer and pyrolysis unit.
