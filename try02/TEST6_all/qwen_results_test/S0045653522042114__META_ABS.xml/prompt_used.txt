You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal treatment of polyvinyl chloride: Reactors, dechlorination chemistry, application, and challenges Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic wastes can bring a series of problems during pyrolysis or incineration such as the emission of dioxins, corrosion, slagging in the reactors, etc. Hydrothermal treatment of PVC plastics has been intensively studied as it can efficiently remove chlorine from PVC plastics under relatively mild reaction conditions (220–300 °C) to provide value-added products. Meanwhile, the research progress, knowledge gaps, and challenges in this field have not been well addressed yet. This paper gives a comprehensive review of hydrothermal dechlorination of PVC plastics regarding reactors, process variables and fundamentals, possible applications, and challenges. The main pathways of hydrothermal dechlorination of PVC plastics are elimination and –OH nucleophilic substitution. Catalytic hydrothermal and co-hydrothermal optimize the chemical reactions and transportation, boosting the dechlorination of PVC plastics. Hydrochar derived from PVC plastics, on the one hand, is coalified close to sub-bituminous and bituminous coal and can be used as low-chlorine solid fuel. On the other hand, it is also a porous material with aromatic structure and oxygen-containing functional groups, with good potential as adsorbent or energy storage materials. Further studies are expected to focus on waste liquid treatment, revealing the energy and economic balance, reducing the dechlorination temperature and pressure, expanding the application of products, etc. for promoting the implementation of the hydrothermal treatment of PVC plastic wastes.
