Comprehensive review on flax shives–Physicochemical properties and application potential Flax fiber has been used extensively in the production of textiles (e.g., clothing, household linens, and upholstery); however flax shives, as a by-product of the fiber extraction process, lacks advanced utilization or appropriate management strategies and typically ends up as a waste stream material. Recently, the upcycling of flax shives has received a great deal of attention owing to their superior morphological, chemical, and mechanical properties. In this review article, the physiochemical properties of flax shives have been discussed, followed by an in-depth description of the potential applications of flax shives as bio-based materials, energy carriers, and a source of bioactive compounds. Finally, the technical challenges, future directions, and main conclusions drawn from this article are provided. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals and recent advancements in flax shives valorization, providing valuable knowledge for fostering the development of flax shives-derived bioproducts.
