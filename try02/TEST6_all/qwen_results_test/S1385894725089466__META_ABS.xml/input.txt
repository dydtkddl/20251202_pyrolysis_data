Methane pyrolysis for H2 production in molten salts: Simulation of the reaction, transport phenomena and the industrial scale process Here, we report the development and application of a hierarchical computer simulation of the molten salt methane pyrolysis process for low CO2-emission H2 production. First, a hierarchical model was developed in Aspen Plus that uses a reactor network to consider gas-phase reaction and liquid film reaction near the gas-liquid interface of the bubbles. Equations were used to correlate reactor geometry and transfer phenomena, and rate expressions were developed to model gas-phase kinetics inside the bubbles, mass transfer into the surrounding film, as well as liquid film reaction. The model was validated using our previous data for molten salt (NaBr+KBr) pyrolysis experiments at varying conditions, such as temperature (850–1000 °C), methane partial pressure, reactor height, and bubble sizes. The flowsheet was then modified to model an industrial-scale reactor for an annual output of 18.6 kt a−1 H2 (equivalent to 83.5 MW HHV). This was done by modelling fluid mechanics and transfer phenomena, such as bubble sizes, bubble break-up and coalescence. Furthermore, additional unit vessels, such as a gas separation, heat exchangers, and salt recovery were added, and a heat integration optimization was performed. We are discussing the hydrogen costs for a wider natural gas feedstock and CAPEX range, which is $2.26–$3.85 kg−1 H2 when not considering revenues from carbon selling. When selling the by-product for $200 t −1, this range lowered to $1.57–3.17 kg−1 H2. This work uniquely integrates film-level transport modelling, reactor hydrodynamics, and full process flow sheeting within a single simulation framework validated by experimental data and extended to techno-economic assessment and could serve as a protocol on how to transfer lab data to model industrial-scale processes.
