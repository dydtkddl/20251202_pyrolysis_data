You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Boosting bacterial nanocellulose production from chemically recycled post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate The circular economy is emerging with new sustainable solutions to the ever-growing plastic waste challenge, garnering increasing attention. In this study, the possibility to modify expensive Hestrin–Schramm medium (HS) for bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) production and replace significant amounts of glucose with terephthalic acid (TPA) derived after reactive extrusion processing of mixed plastic waste yielding post consumer TPA (pcTPA), was evaluated from laboratory scale to fermentation at pilot scale. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were used to assess the structural, thermal, and morphological properties of BNC and its generated derivatives. The study's findings highlight the positive impact of pcTPA on BNC yield, surpassing the performance of conventional TPA. The presence of pcTPA in the medium resulted in a BNC yield of 4.01 g/L in a scale-up step of 100 mL cultivation, while the positive control using glucose resulted in a yield of 3.57 g/L. The efficiency of glucose substitution with pcTPA increased with each scale-up step, ultimately reaching a 320% yield increase in comparison to the positive control. Additionaly, the procedure that enhanced the materials' thermoplasticity in the form of derivatives has been established resulting in the production of BNC laurate and BNC octanoate derivatives with melting temperatures of 270 °C and 280 °C, respectively. Overall, this study investigates the potential of this approach as an important circular economic solution, enabling an increased sustainable perspective for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) circularity and significantly a much needed cost reduction for BNC production with enhanced thermoplasticity.
