You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of hydrogen and nanocarbon via catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyolefin over nickel-impregnated coal flyash catalyst The conversion of waste polyolefins into valuable products like hydrogen and nanocarbon offers a promising pathway for waste management and resource recovery. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis using coal flyash (FA) and nickel-impregnated flyash (Ni-FA) as catalysts. Coal flyash, rich in Al2O3 and SiO2, serves as a sustainable and low-cost support for Ni impregnation, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Characterization using TPR, XRD, and FESEM confirmed effective dispersion of Ni on the surface of flyash. The catalysts were then used during pyrolysis of LDPE, HDPE, and PP in a fixed-bed reactor. Ni-FA catalyst yielded 60–75 vol% H2 as compared to 25–60 vol% obtained using FA alone. The nanocarbon structures formed on the Ni-FA catalysts were predominantly multi-walled carbon nanotubes with diameters ranging from 10 to 60 nm, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, and HRTEM. The findings indicate that Ni-FA is a cost-effective and sustainable catalyst, leveraging industrial waste material to address both plastic pollution and the growing demand for H2 and nanocarbon. This study highlights the dual benefit of waste valorization and energy recovery, offering a scalable and environmentally friendly approach for a circular economy. Future research will delve into enhancing the ability of the catalyst by recovering the nanocarbon and regenerating the catalyst for further cycles.
