Pyrolysis synergy of municipal solid waste (MSW): A review The synergistic pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) were recently explored. This review aims to provide an overview on the synergistic pyrolysis studies of MSW, focusing on the synergy occurred during co-pyrolysis of different constituents of MSW. The interactions of intermediates released during pyrolysis can shift end product distributions, accelerate pyrolysis rates, and preferred production of specific compounds, which were categorized into four basic types with discussions. The pyrolysis synergy is proposed to be the key for success of pyrolytic practice of MSW that can handle the waste with maximal resource recovery and minimal carbon emission.
