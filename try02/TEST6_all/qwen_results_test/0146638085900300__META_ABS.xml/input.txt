Multifacetted study of a cretaceous coal with algal affinities—II. Composition of liquefaction products Two hydrogen-rich lithobodies of highly alipathic character from a coal occurring in southwest Utah, have been studied. Bituminite (>50%), vitrinite (25–30%) and liptodetrinite (7–12%) are the principal macerals. The hexane-soluble products of hydrogenating the lithotypes at 400° with tetralin and hydrogen have been analyzed by GC-MS. Products identified include homologous series of alkylated naphthalenes, phenols, furans, cyclohexenones and hydroxy-pyridines. In the case of furans, the alkyl groups extend beyond C30. Materials released by Soxhlet extraction with pyridine consist chiefly of homologous series of fatty acids and their methyl esters and of methyl alkyl ketones, which were not found in the hydrogenation products. The long alkyl chains in these substances can account for about 75% of the alkanes found in the hydrogenation products but not in the extracts. Most of the compounds mentioned in the foregoing are thought to be physically held or trapped in the coal, rather than chemically combined in its macromolecular network. Except for the fatty acids, the origins of these substances are difficult to identify.
