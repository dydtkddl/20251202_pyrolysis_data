You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on the optimization of parameters during biomass pyrolysis and char gasification for hydrogen-rich gas In order to achieve the efficient conversion of biomass char into hydrogen-rich gas at lower temperatures and investigate the different effects of potassium during biomass pyrolysis and char conversion, gasification experiments of the chars derived from wheat straw were carried out in steam atmosphere based on Response Surface Methodology. The response surface was set up with three parameters (pyrolysis temperature, K2CO3 loading concentration and the content of K-based catalyst in bed materials) for char gasification performances of carbon conversion efficiency, hydrogen yield and reaction rate to make analysis and optimization about the experimental conditions. The results showed that suggested conditions of char steam gasification were 650 °C for pyrolysis temperature, 22% for K2CO3 loading concentration and 70% for the content of K-based catalyst in bed materials. In these conditions, the confirmatory experiment indicated that carbon conversion efficiency was 95.1% while hydrogen yield and reaction rate reached 182.5 mol/kg-char and 1.55%/min, which was in good agreement with the model prediction. In addition, H2 concentrations were able to attain 70%. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were employed to draw conclusions of char characterizations and account for the optimization results: i) chars obtained by the pyrolysis around 650 °C were liable to be gasified due to the cracked structures without carbonization occurring, and ii) properly loaded K2CO3 tended to cause the formation of porous sponge-like textures on char surfaces and contributed to maintaining the variety of functional groups with H and O, resulting in enhanced char reactivity.
