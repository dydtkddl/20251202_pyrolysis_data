You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biotechnological and bioinformatics approaches for augmentation of biohydrogen production: A review Biohydrogen production (BHP) from biomass is a characteristic feature of prokaryotes and is considered to be a vital source of renewable energy. It is considered as the cleanest fuel with no emanation of greenhouse gases on ignition. The major biological processes for hydrogen (H2) production are: biophotolysis of water by algae and cyanobacteria, dark fermentation and photo-fermentation. For the past fifty years, lot of work has been carried out for understanding and improving BHP and still it has to overcome some of the serious limitations so that it becomes viable proposition. The bottlenecks include thermodynamic inefficiency, difficulty in using lignocellulosics as feed material, raw material cost and lower hydrogen yield. To overcome these major problems, the conventional approach is not enough and one has to vigorously think modern bioinformatics approaches to conquer them. The accessibility of huge sequenced genomes, functional genomics studies, the development of in silico models at the genome scale, metabolic pathway reconstruction, and synthetic biology approach predicts engineering strategies to enhance H2 production in an organism. This review investigates the recent status and advancements that have been made in the area of biotechnology and bioinformatics, to understand and enhance the H2 generation to overcome current limitations and make biohydrogen, a reality in near future.
