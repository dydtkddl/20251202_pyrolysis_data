Smart recycling of PET to sorbents for insecticides through in situ MOF growth The continually growing level of ecotoxicants generates a request for principal new strategies to safeguard the environment. In this contribution, we proposed a comprehensive approach to solving two emerging problems: recycling polyethylene terephthalate wastes (PET) and removing toxic insecticides from water. The developed technology consumed PET bottles as the source and support for the growth of UiO-66 frameworks and were further applied for the removal of imidacloprid from water. The prepared material was characterized by a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques confirming the high loading and homogenous distribution of UiO-66 across the PET support. The sorbent (PET@UiO-66) delivered considerable technical advantages beyond the convenient sorbents: sustainable and cheap preparation; high adsorption capacity and rate; stability and recyclability; 100 times enhanced permeability compared to UiO-66 powder; and applicability in fixed-bed columns. We believe that the proposed design and technological relevance will be a basis for the further developing of the smart utilization of wastes for sustainable functional materials.
