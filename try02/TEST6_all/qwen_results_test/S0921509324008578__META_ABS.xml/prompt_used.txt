You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel nickel-based superalloy with excellent high temperature performance designed for laser additive manufacturing The nickel-based superalloys prepared by additive manufacturing (AM) commonly exhibit inferior mechanical properties at high temperatures, particularly in terms of ductility and creep resistance, compared to the corresponding conventional manufactured (CM)alloys, and this significantly hinders the widespread application of AM nickel-based superalloys in the aerospace industry. To address this problem, a novel nickel-based superalloy for additive manufacturing, Hastelloy X-AM (HX-AM), using the yttrium (Y) alloying strategy has been developed in this work. The results show that the Y element is present in the matrix as Ni5Y phase and yttrium oxide nanoparticles after laser additive manufacturing, exerting a significant inhibitory effect on the precipitation and coarsening of detrimental second phases at grain boundaries (GBs) during subsequent heat treatment or service processes. The HX-AM alloy exhibits an exceptional matching relationship between strength (ultimate tensile strength = 315 ± 3 MPa) and ductility (total elongation = 56 ± 1.7 %) at 900 °C. What's more, the creep performance of HX-AM alloy is significantly improved simultaneously compared with CM Ni-based alloys at 900 °C, overcoming the longstanding challenge of inferior creep performance in AM nickel-based superalloys at high temperature. The fatigue lifetime of HX-AM alloy reaches 295.6 h at 900 °C/40 MPa, showing over fifteenfold enhancement compared to that of CM Hastelloy X alloy.
