You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of empty fruit bunch as a feedstock for gasification process by employing hydrothermal treatment Experiments were carried out in a 500 mL digester at a temperature of 120, 150, or 180oC for a holding time of 60 min. The ratio of water to empty fruit bunch was 8 mL/gram. At these HT process conditions, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and heating value of HT-EFB (solid product from HT) did not change significantly. However, the ash content in HT-EFB decreased significantly even from HT with a temperature of 120oC, from 3.20% to 1.9% for raw EFB to HT-EFB, respectively. Furthermore, K2O content in the ash in HT-EFB decreased significantly also, i.e. from 24% to 17%. Concerning with potassium, a longer holding time (HT at 120oC) could further decrease the potassium content in HT-EFB, from 16% to 9% for the holding time of 60 to 120 min, respectively. Since SiO2 dissolved very little in water while alkaline dissolved much more, silica content in the ash increased from about 44% in raw EFB to 53% in HT-EFB. In line with the change in the ash content and the mineral composition in the ash, the melting properties of ash in HT-EFB significantly changed.
