You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermophotovoltaics: Fundamentals, challenges and prospects Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) is concerned with the application of photovoltaic diodes to harvest electricity from thermal radiation. This is achieved through the use of appropriately designed thermal emitters which are typically heated to temperatures of more than 800 ° C. Merits of thermophotovoltaics include the prospect of delivering high power density compared to solar photovoltaics, fuel versatility, portability and capability of around-the-clock operation. The key challenges en route to commercialization of TPV technology include low heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency, mechanical and thermostructural reliability at high temperatures, and cost. Recent advances which include the development of photonic crystal emitters, miniaturization of TPV systems, and improvement of rare earth oxide emitters have contributed to enhancing the performance of TPV systems. Further, current research on ultra-low bandgap photovoltaic materials, thin film monolithic system design, and global system optimization promise additional advances. This article presents an overview of the fundamental principles of thermophotovoltaics followed by a review of the development of all the main components comprising combustion thermophotovoltaic systems. This review also scrutinizes state-of-the-art developments, discusses the fundamental and technical challenges facing commercial adoption of TPV, and prospects of TPV.
