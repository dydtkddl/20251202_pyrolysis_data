You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Template-assisted construction of molybdenum-doped ruthenium dioxide hollow nanospheres for highly efficient acidic oxygen evolution reaction Developing non-iridium-based electrocatalysts with enhanced activity and durability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is urgently demanded for the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. In this study, a highly efficient Ti-supported Mo-doped RuO2 hollow nanosphere electrocatalyst (Mox-RuO2/Ti) is fabricated by a template-assisted method. The resulting Mo0.25-RuO2/Ti electrocatalyst with appropriate Mo doping demonstrates exceptional OER catalytic activity with a minimal overpotential of 175 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and maintains a remarkable electrochemical stability of 400 h in acidic conditions, significantly superior to the commercial RuO2/Ti catalyst. Based on the experimental results and theoretical calculations, this impressive OER performance stems from the synergistic effects of the high exposure of the active sites by the hollow spherical nanostructure and the electronic modulation of Ru active sites induced by Mo doping. This study underscores an effective approach for designing highly active and stable RuO2-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER.
