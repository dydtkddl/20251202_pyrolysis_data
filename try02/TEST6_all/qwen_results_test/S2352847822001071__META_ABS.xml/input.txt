Recent development of thermoelectric nanofibers and their composites This review deals with the recent development of thermoelectric (TE) nanofibers and their composite materials. Typical processing and manufacturing technologies for preparing nanofibers are introduced. Specifically, electrospinning, electrochemical oxidation, and liquid phase chemical deposition approaches are discussed. Various kinds of TE nanofibers are introduced one-by-one. Several important inorganic and organic nanofibers including carbon-based nanofibers, conducting polymer-based nanofibers, and transition metal oxide-based nanofibers with significant thermoelectric responses are shown. Thermoelectric properties of some important nanofibers are compared. The applications of TE nanofibers for energy conversion, thermal imaging and temperature sensing are illustrated. Perspectives and concluding remarks are presented.
