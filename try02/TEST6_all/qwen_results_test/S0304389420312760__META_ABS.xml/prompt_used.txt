You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted solvent extraction and double-shot analytical pyrolysis for the quali-quantitation of plasticizers and microplastics in beach sand samples Pollution from microplastics (MPs) needs to be evaluated by deploying reliable analytical techniques that provide qualitative and quantitative data on the extent of contamination in the various environmental matrices. Solvent extraction of MPs followed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) provides data that not only regard the soluble plastics, but also the organic additives contained in MPs and the low-molecular weight degradation products of insoluble plastics. In this study, the potential of microwave-assisted solvent extraction and double-shot Py-GC–MS was investigated in order to obtain quali-quantitative information on polystyrene and on phthalate plasticizers in environmental samples. The method was validated and provided recoveries higher than 96 %, and detection limits lower than 1 ng and 1 μg for phthalates and polystyrene, respectively. We used the method to analyze samples of sand collected from a shoreline in Tuscany (central Italy) and thereby determine the content of phthalates and polystyrene at different depths and distances from the coastline. Qualitative data were also obtained regarding the presence of oxidation products derived from polyethylene and polypropylene. The different contents of plasticizers, plastics, and degradation products in the investigated samples are discussed in relation to how environmental agents affect the leaching and degradation processes of the polymers.
