Microwave-assisted solvent extraction and double-shot analytical pyrolysis for the quali-quantitation of plasticizers and microplastics in beach sand samples Pollution from microplastics (MPs) needs to be evaluated by deploying reliable analytical techniques that provide qualitative and quantitative data on the extent of contamination in the various environmental matrices. Solvent extraction of MPs followed by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) provides data that not only regard the soluble plastics, but also the organic additives contained in MPs and the low-molecular weight degradation products of insoluble plastics. In this study, the potential of microwave-assisted solvent extraction and double-shot Py-GC–MS was investigated in order to obtain quali-quantitative information on polystyrene and on phthalate plasticizers in environmental samples. The method was validated and provided recoveries higher than 96 %, and detection limits lower than 1 ng and 1 μg for phthalates and polystyrene, respectively. We used the method to analyze samples of sand collected from a shoreline in Tuscany (central Italy) and thereby determine the content of phthalates and polystyrene at different depths and distances from the coastline. Qualitative data were also obtained regarding the presence of oxidation products derived from polyethylene and polypropylene. The different contents of plasticizers, plastics, and degradation products in the investigated samples are discussed in relation to how environmental agents affect the leaching and degradation processes of the polymers.
