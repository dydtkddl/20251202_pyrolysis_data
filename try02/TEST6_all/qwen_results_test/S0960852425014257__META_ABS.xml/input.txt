Enhancing anaerobic digestion of polyhydroxybutyrate through combined pretreatment: Effects on solubilization, methane potential, and long-term continuous thermophilic digestion Combined mechanical and thermal-alkaline pretreatment of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), varying particle-size (100–2000 μm), NaOH-dosage (20–100 %), and treatment-duration (6–24 h), was evaluated to enhance solubilization and anaerobic digestion (AD). A response surface analysis optimized pretreatment, achieving ≥98 % PHB-solubilization, with thermal-alkaline pretreatment more effective at smaller particle sizes. In biochemical-methane-potential (BMP) tests, mechanical pretreatment alone was ineffective, while the combined pretreatment enhanced BMP 3.2–7.2 times. Thermophilic BMP outperformed mesophilic BMP, yielding 279–309 mL-CH4/g-CODfed. In 340-day continuous experiment, thermophilic AD of the pretreated PHB wastewater in CSTR was confirmed to be feasible at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24–30d, with 91–94 % COD removal and 276–290 mL-CH4/g-CODfed. At 20d HRT, crotonate accumulation caused severe methanogenic inhibition. Distinct bacterial communities and co-dominance of Methanosarcina and Methanothermobacter were underlying PHB and intermediate degradation and methanogenesis. These findings highlight the potential of thermophilic AD for valorizing PHB wastes following optimized pretreatment.
