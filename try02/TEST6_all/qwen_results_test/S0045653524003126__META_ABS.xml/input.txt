Sustainability, performance, and production perspectives of waste-derived functional carbon nanomaterials towards a sustainable environment: A review The survival of humanity is severely threatened by the massive accumulation of waste in the ecosystem. One plausible solution for the management and upcycling of waste is conversing waste at the molecular level and deriving carbon-based nanomaterial. The field of carbon nanomaterials with distinctive properties, such as exceptionally large surface areas, good thermal and chemical stability, and improved propagation of charge carriers, remains a significant area of research. The study demonstrates recent developments in high-value carbon-based photocatalysts synthesis from various waste precursors, including zoonotic, phytogenic, polyolefinic, electronic, and biomedical, highlighting the progression as photocatalysts and adsorbents for wastewater treatment and water splitting applications. This review highpoints the benefits of using waste as a precursor to support sustainability and circular economy and the risks associated with their use. Finally, we support that a sustainable society will eventually be realized by exploring present obstacles and potential steps for creating superior carbon-based nanomaterials in the future.
