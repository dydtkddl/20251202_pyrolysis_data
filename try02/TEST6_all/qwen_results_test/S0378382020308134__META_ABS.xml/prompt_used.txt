You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of waste polypropylene plastics for energy recovery: Influence of heating rate and vacuum conditions on composition of fuel product This study compared the pyrolysis of waste polypropylene (PP) into fuel products under atmospheric and vacuum pressure conditions at different temperatures and heating rates. Four different temperatures (450, 488, 525 and 600 °C) at slow (15 °C/min) and fast (about 180 °C/min) heating rates were examined on a bench scale reactor. Pyrolysis vapours were recovered as heavy and light fractions by fractional condensation and characterised using GC/MS. Among all temperatures, 488 and 525 °C generated promising yields of condensable products under both atmospheric and vacuum conditions, with total yields in the range of 81–93 wt%. Heating rate effects on product composition distribution were more pronounced under vacuum pyrolysis. Gasoline range compounds predominated in light condensable products recovered under both atmospheric and vacuum pyrolysis. Vacuum suction limited the condensation of gasoline range compounds in the heavy fraction, resulting in Diesel/Gasoline ratio higher than 30. Higher Heating Values (HHVs) of all condensable products recovered under both atmospheric and vacuum conditions ranged between 41 and 46 MJ/kg, with higher values being obtained under milder conditions. Increased production of aromatics explained the lower HHVs obtained at higher temperatures.
