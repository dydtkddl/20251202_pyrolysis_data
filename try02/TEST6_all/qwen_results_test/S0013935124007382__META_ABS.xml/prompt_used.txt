You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable efficient utilization of magnetic porous biochar for adsorption of orange G and tetracycline: Inherent roles of adsorption and mechanisms Iron-doped biochar has been widely used as an adsorbent to remove contaminants due to the high adsorption performance, but it still suffers from complicated preparation methods, unstable iron loading, unsatisfactory specific surface area, and uneven distribution of active sites. Here, a novel magnetic porous biochar (FeCS800) with nanostructure on surface was synthesized by one-pot pyrolysis method of corn straw with K2FeO4, and used in orange G (OG) and tetracycline (TC) adsorption. FeCS800 exhibited outstanding adsorption capacities for OG and TC after K2FeO4 activation and the adsorption data were fitted satisfactorily to Langmuir isotherm and Pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The maximum adsorption capacities of FeCS800 for OG and TC were around 303.03 mg/g and 322.58 mg/g, respectively, at 25 °C and pH 7.0, which were 16.27 and 24.61 times higher than that before modification. Thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption of OG/TC by FeCS800 were thermodynamically favorable and highly spontaneous. And the adsorption capacity of OG and TC by FeCS800 remained 77% and 81% after 5 cycles, respectively, indicating that FeCS800 had good stability. The outstanding adsorption properties and remarkable reusability of FeCS800 show its great potential to be an economic and environmental adsorbent in contaminants removal.
