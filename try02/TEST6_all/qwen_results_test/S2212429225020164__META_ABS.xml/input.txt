Recent advances in carbon dots-loaded composite films for food preservation and freshness monitoring: A review Carbon dots (CDs) have gained increasing attention across multiple disciplines due to their unique antibacterial activity, antioxidant properties, and tunable fluorescence characteristics. Particularly in the food industry, the incorporation of CDs-based detection platforms into food packaging materials has enabled the development of composite films with dual functionalities of food preservation and real-time monitoring. This review provides an overview of the synthesis methods of CDs, elucidates the antimicrobial and antioxidant mechanisms of CDs, and discusses their effective application strategies for extending food shelf life. The fluorescence properties of CDs are analyzed, and the potential of utilizing these properties for intelligent food freshness monitoring is explored. Furthermore, the challenges facing these technologies and future development trends are discussed, with a particular emphasis on the integration of CDs with Internet of Things and machine learning technologies for real-time monitoring of food quality, providing theoretical insights for the development of next-generation multifunctional active packaging materials.
