You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Millisecond dwell time enables closed-loop recycling of polypropylene waste plastics: effects of pyrolysis parameters on low-carbon olefin and carbon nanosphere formation Thermochemical methods offer a promising solution for converting waste plastics into high-value fuels or chemicals, helping to reduce plastic accumulation in the environment and promote sustainable development. However, existing methods typically require secondary processing to effectively produce low-carbon olefin (C2-C4) monomers, such as ethylene and propylene, making true closed-loop recycling difficult to achieve. To address this, the present study introduces a new approach based on Flash Joule Heating (FJH) technology, which efficiently deconstructs polypropylene (PP) plastic in millisecond residence time, yielding low-carbon olefins. By optimizing reaction parameters, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins can reach up to 84 %. Increasing the reaction temperature promotes chain hydrocarbon radical cyclization, Diels-Alder reactions, and subsequent dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of aromatic compounds that undergo thermal polycondensation to produce carbon nanospheres with particle sizes ranging from 100 to 180 nm. This lab-scale study demonstrates the potential for efficient closed-loop recycling of PP waste plastics, providing valuable insights to advance the practical application of closed-loop recycling technologies for waste plastics.
