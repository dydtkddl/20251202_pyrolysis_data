You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Minerals and iron-making reactions in blast furnaces Coke is central to blast furnace operation, but because it is the most expensive raw material used, there is continuing pressure to minimize its use. Consequently, it has become increasingly pertinent to measure and predict the factors affecting coke performance more accurately. Coke performance is affected both by its properties and blast furnace operation. Recently, the importance of the minerals in coke in determining its performance in the blast furnace has been recognized. Minerals in coke influence its reaction with gas, metal and slag phases. This paper reviews coke behavior in an operating blast furnace with the main emphasis being on the role of its inherent mineral matter. Various techniques including advanced approaches such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been used to identify and quantify coke minerals. Fundamental studies based on bench-scale reactors have highlighted the role of various mineral phases on the kinetics of gasification, hot-metal carburization and slag reactions. Because coke reaction rates are influenced by the constituent mineral phases differently, conventional ash analysis is not sufficient to determine the true impact of coke minerals on coke reactivity. The dominant catalytic phases of coke minerals can be identified and related to coke gasification with CO2 at low temperatures. The kinetics of hot-metal carburization by coke and its temperature dependence is influenced by the melting behavior of minerals. Coke–slag reaction rates are largely influenced by total mineral matter content as well as composition. Coke changes its properties during descent through an experimental blast furnace (EBF) and some of these changes are presented. The increase in the ordering of the carbon in the coke as it descends the EBF can be related to increases in coke ordering in a bench-scale reactor, indicating that order in a particular coke may serve as a thermometer of its maximum exposure temperature. Moreover, coke fines emissions are influenced by the extent of graphitization in industrial blast furnaces. In contrast, coke reactivity in an operating blast furnace is influenced by recirculating alkalis as well as inherent mineral matter. Mineral phases of industrial cokes were found to be changed after CO2 gasification with increasing reaction temperatures. Coke quality needs in current and emerging blast furnace process innovations are discussed to highlight that existing tests are not sufficient. A comprehensive coke quality index is required, particularly one that incorporates the heterogeneity of coke minerals, in order to make a reliable assessment of the impact of cokes on iron-making reactions.
