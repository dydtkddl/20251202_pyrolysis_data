You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of plastic-rich streams from waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) sorting plants: An in-depth study of pyrolysis potential through product characterization and life cycle assessment (LCA) Thermochemical recycling is emerging as a viable alternative for the recycling of complex plastic waste streams, such as those originated in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) sorting facilities. In this work, three different WEEE plastic-rich samples are subjected to pyrolysis and the resulting products are thoroughly analyzed to assess their potential industrial utilization. The pyrolysis processes are conducted in a 3 L non-stirred tank reactor at a heating rate of 15 °C/min, reaching a final temperature of 500 °C with a dwell time of 30 min, using 1 L/min of N2 as carrier gas. The pyrolysis products are characterized and evaluated for their potential applications, including petrochemical feedstock, refuse derived fuel (RDF), and solid adsorbent. The results indicate that pyrolysis liquids can be used as RDF in cement kilns, provided the halogen content is below acceptance limits. The gases produced could be used as refinery gases after pollutant removal. Additionally, the solid fraction casts promising results in preliminary tests as a drug adsorbent in water, suggesting a new and very interesting path of research. Life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that the pyrolysis of sample C, which has the worst chemical properties, gives the lowest environmental impact, since the solid fraction from this sample is the most effective adsorbent, achieving almost 100 % removal efficiency for the tested drugs. The findings suggest that pyrolysis of plastic-rich streams should not always be focused on the oil production, as it can yield other valuable products.
