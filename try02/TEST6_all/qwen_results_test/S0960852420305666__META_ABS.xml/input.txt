Hydrothermal liquefaction of rice husk and cow dung in Mixed-Bed-Rotating Pyrolyzer and application of biochar for dye removal This work studied the hydrothermal liquefaction of rice husk (RH) and cow dung (CD) for the production of biochar from RH and CD and use of that biochar for the removal of dye from textile industry effluent. These biomasses were subjected to fast pyrolysis (500 °C), which yielded biochar (22.8 and 29.8%) and bio-oil (60.4 and 57.3%) from RH and CD, respectively. Biochar was characterized based on spectroscopy Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and morphological studies like Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and SEM-EDS. Further, bio-oil samples were characterized by GC–MS into saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, carboxylic acids, phenolics and aromatic hydrocarbons. The removal efficiencies of the Congo red dye from prepared biochar in a batch experiment were 66.8–96.9%(RH) and 68.9–98.8%(CD). The adsorption isotherms for Langmuir (R2 = 0.977 and 0.902) and Freundlich (R2 0.842 and 0.883) were calculated for RH and CD biochar, respectively.
