Tape casting technique in the fabrication of ceramic membranes: A review of influential factors and applications in water and wastewater treatment The tape casting method is a versatile process that produces ceramic membranes of exceptional quality, demonstrating high stability in chemical and thermal properties, mechanical strength, and separation efficiency. Because tape casting allows for precise control over both thickness and shape, it is particularly advantageous for manufacturing thin flat membranes. The techniques of phase inversion, sol–gel, and freeze-drying have expanded application areas of this method. This review emphasizes the properties of all methods and the importance of optimizing factors such as solvent types and concentrations, ceramic material type, casting thickness, polymer and additive types and concentrations, and drying and sintering conditions in this method. Tape-casted ceramic membranes showed significant potential in various fields, including fuel cells, desalination, and oily wastewater treatment. However, challenges remain, such as increasing output and improving cost-effectiveness, but ongoing innovation and optimization will propel the development of more effective and durable solutions for environmental and energy-related challenges.
