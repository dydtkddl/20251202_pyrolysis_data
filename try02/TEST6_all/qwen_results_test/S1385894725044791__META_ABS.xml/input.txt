Upgrading polyethylene waste to carbon materials for efficient persulfate activation: the role of specific surface area and oxygen functional groups Upcycling waste plastics into high-value carbon materials offers a promising approach to waste management, effectively addressing plastic pollution and reducing carbon emissions. However, studies exploring the conversion patterns of these plastics to carbon materials and their use of these materials for persulfate activation remain limited. This study investigates the effect of polyethylene density on the structure of derived carbon materials and their catalytic performance in peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. Structural characterization shows that carbon materials derived from polyethylene with low crystallinity and adequate catalyst content exhibit a higher specific surface area, enhanced pore structure, and superior PDS activation and sulfamethoxazole removal performance. Quenching experiments, EPR analysis, and electrochemical methods reveal electron transfer as the primary reaction pathway across all systems. The constitutive trap relationship suggests that the specific surface area and the content of oxygen groups (particularly carbonyl groups) are key factors influencing PDS adsorption and facilitating the electron transfer process. The life cycle assessment and excellent stability highlight the material’s potential for effectively treating real industrial wastewaters. This work presents a novel strategy for designing high-performance carbon catalysts from waste plastics and advances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PDS activation by carbon materials.
