You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast Pyrolysis of Residues from Paper Mill Industry to Bio-oil and Value Chemicals: Optimization Studies Biomass is a renewable energy and had been recognized as a promising feedstock for producing bio-fuels. In this work, pyrolysis of black wattle residues was investigated with the aim to study the product distribution and their chemical composition and predicting the optimal condition for maximized bio-oil especially aromatics content by using a two level factorial design of experiment. The pyrolysis were performed at temperature of 380 – 580 oC, Under screw feeder carried the biomass residues and weight of dolomite as catalyst of 1-5 wt% inside pyrolyzer with nitrogen gases flow rate of 20 to 80 cm3/min The detention time was controlled by reactor screw feeder at feeding rate of 120 to 240rpm. Based on the analysis from a design-expert program to determine the appropriated condition of experiment was 515.18 oC, 120.01rpm of feed rate and 20.00 cm3/min of nitrogen flow rate using 5.00wt% of dolomite catalyst. The elemental and physicochemistry analysis of bio-oil were determined, the chemical composition also investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1H NMR. The composition of bio-oil mainly oxygenated compound with high molecular weight and phenol. The results show that the biomass residual can be considered as a potential alternative fuels and relevant to valuable chemical feedstock.
