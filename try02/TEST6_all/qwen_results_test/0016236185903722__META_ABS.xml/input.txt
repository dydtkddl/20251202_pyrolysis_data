Coal liquefaction using a hydrogenated creosote oil solvent H-atom transfer from hydrogen donor components in the solvent The presence of hydroaromatic, hydrogen donor components in a coal-derived solvent is one of the more important factors in the successful operation of a non-catalytic coal liquefaction process. Various hydrogen donor species present in a hydrogenated creosote oil have been identified. Their rate of disappearance under conditions that are consistent with a short residence time coal liquefaction process has been used to rank the reactivities of the various hydrogen donors. 1,2,3,10b-Tetrahydrofluoranthene was found to be an exceptional donor while 4,5-dihydropyrene, the hexahydropyrenes and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene were found to be quite active. Sym.-octahydrophenanthrene and 2a,3,4,5-tetrahydroacenaphthene exhibited moderate activity. Tetralin and the four methyltetralin isomers were found to be unreactive under the coal liquefaction conditions employed.
