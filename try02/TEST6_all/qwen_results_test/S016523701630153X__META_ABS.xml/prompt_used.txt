You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanotubes synthetized from gaseous products of waste polymer pyrolysis and their application This work is dedicated to the synthesis of carbon nanotube from pyrolysis gases obtained by plastics. Virgin and waste plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinyl-chloride, municipal plastic waste) were used as raw materials and fed into a horizontal tubular reactor and pyrolyzed without catalyst at 560–570°C. Raw materials could be transformed into 14–32% gases and 15–44% pyrolysis oils, depending on the type of raw materials. Pyrolysis of municipal plastic waste produced the highest gas yield, while pyrolysis of virgin polypropylene gave the highest oil yield. Gases were passed through a chemical vapour deposition reactor, where they were transformed into carbon nanotubes at 700°C in a semi-continuous rotating reactor with 0.5h reaction time. To enhance the transformation of pyrolysis gases into carbon nanotubes (CNTs), Fe and Co based catalysts were used. Both gaseous and oil products of pyrolysis were investigated by gas-chromatography. The produced CNTs were added as reinforcement into a commercial low density polyethylene matrix using heated two roll mill and then specimens for testing were manufactured. Especially the reinforcing effects of carbon nanotube were investigated through the measuring of tensile and Charpy impact properties of the CNTs-LDPE polymers.
