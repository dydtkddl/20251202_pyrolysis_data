Effect of Cu molar ratio on Ni-Cu/aluminosilicate catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol Bio-oils obtained from rapid pyrolysis have emerged as a renewable energy source, but their high content of oxygenated molecules gives them unwanted properties for their use as green fuels. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is the process used to improve their quality by removing oxygen heteroatoms from them. At the research stage, HDO is commonly studied with model molecules such as guaiacol. Bimetallic supported NiCu catalysts are efficient for diverse hydrogenations. However, published studies do not allow concluding whether supported NiCu catalysts lead to green fuels which are free from oxygen heteroatoms. For this reason, we systematically studied the properties of Al2O3 and Al2O3-SiO2 supported NiCu catalysts for the HDO of guaiacol in a batch reactor at representative process conditions; 250°C and p H 2 = 6.9 MPa . In general, supported monometallic Ni catalysts were the most active among all catalysts. Furthermore, the addition of Cu promoted the formation of large Cu-rich alloy particles that decreased the apparent initial reaction rate regardless of the support. This effect was stronger when aluminosilicates were used as catalytic support. In addition, Ni was responsible for directing the reaction route towards the hydrogenation pathway in the bimetallic catalysts, while Cu monometallic catalysts followed the direct deoxygenation route. On the other hand, the modification of the support increased the formation of green cyclohexane, even in monometallic Cu catalysts, allowing to obtain a highly active and selective monometallic Ni catalyst towards the production of cyclohexane.
