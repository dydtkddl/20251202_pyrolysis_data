You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pt supported on modified-coal gasification slag for efficient dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane in a fixed bed reactor Coal gasification slag (CGS) was used for modification and loaded platinum (Pt) to liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) for the first time. The carbon hybrid silica (C/SiO2) was prepared by removing metal oxides and carbon residue of CGS through acid treatment and calcination. The C/SiO2 loaded Pt (Pt-C/SiO2) exhibited only a 1.3% decrease in dehydrogenation conversion rate after 30 h of continuous catalytic dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane (MCH), and even after 100 h, the decrease was only 4.9%. When Pt was directly loaded on CGS (Pt-CGS), it showed higher catalytic activity (dehydrogenation conversion rate was 20.4%), but lower catalytic stability (dehydrogenation conversion rate decreased by 56% after 7 h). Additionally, commercial Pt-SiO2 catalysts exhibited poor dehydrogenation conversion rate, significantly lower than that of Pt-C/SiO2. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the influence of carbon hybrid SiO2 on the adsorption energy, electron transfer and density of states for the catalytic dehydrogenation of MCH. The highly active and stable Pt-C/SiO2 catalyst can be effectively utilized for LOCH while achieving high-value utilization of CGS solid waste.
