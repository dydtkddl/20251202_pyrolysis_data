You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Immobilization strategies for heterogeneous catalysts in micro flow chemistry: Key techniques for efficient and sustainable chemical transformations In the domain of catalysis, heterogeneous catalysts are predominantly utilized, with catalyst immobilization techniques playing a pivotal role in determining performance and reaction efficiency. A variety of immobilization methods, including in situ growth, hybridization, and chemical grafting, are not only available but also essential for enhancing the number and dispersion of active sites, thereby elevating catalytic efficiency. However, the practical implementation of these techniques often encounters challenges such as reduced reactivity, insufficient stability, and difficulties in maintaining uniformity. Continuous flow heterogeneous catalysis, a significant subset of heterogeneous catalytic systems, has gained prominence in the synthesis of fine chemicals due to its high safety, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. This review systematically summarizes the current design strategies for heterogeneous catalysts in flow reactors, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of various immobilization techniques. Specifically, we focus on the successful application of these technologies in microfluidic channels to enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, achieve precise control of reaction conditions, and improve catalyst stability and recyclability. The aim of this review is to provide readers with a deeper understanding of catalyst heterogeneity approaches in microfluidic channels and to facilitate research on the rational design of more advanced heterogeneous catalysts for industrial applications.
