Co-gasification of coal and biomass blends: Chemistry and engineering A critical review and analysis of co-gasification of coal/biomass blends is presented. Initially, the chemistry of gasification of coal and biomass has been described along with different models for pyrolysis of cellulose/biomass. The mechanistic issues of catalytic effect of alkali metals on coal char gasification have been reviewed. This is followed by literature review on gasification of coal/biomass blends in two parts, viz. thermogravimetric and fluidized bed gasification. First part deals with effects of operational parameters on char reactivity. Second part analyzes influence of these parameters on gasification chemistry and producer gas. Factors governing tar content in producer gas have been discussed. Finally, the literature on kinetic modeling of coal/biomass blends has been analyzed. Some new approaches in kinetic modeling of solid-state reactions have been discussed.
