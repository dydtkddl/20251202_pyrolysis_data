Co-gasification and recent developments on waste-to-energy conversion: A review Biomass is currently seen as a promising renewable energy source, which can be sustainably utilized in the production of fuels and electric energy adding no carbon dioxide to the environment. Co-gasification has unveiled its potential amongst thermal techniques, as a result of the valuable products obtained, strengthening a solid position in the conversion of residues. Thus, the prevention of a complete depletion of non-renewable sources is supported and the effects of their utilization alleviated. Extensive literature review was conducted and, few reports on co-gasification of biomass and wastes were found. In this context, this review addresses their thermal conversion, highlighting issues related to the equipment, operating conditions and physicochemical phenomena involved in such a complex process. Among other conclusions, the most important finding of this work was the synergy often encountered between the two feedstocks, proving co-gasification can overcome several of the individual gasification issues enhancing products quality and yields over biomass or wastes alone, and attesting its environmental-friendly character, with lower greenhouse gas emissions. It was also possible to depict some trends on the effect of biomass and waste blending ratios, as well as elucidating some of the mechanisms involved in their interaction. These are majorly explained by the response of molecules during pyrolysis and by hydrogen transfer from waste polymers to biomass derivatives. Experimental conditions were also assessed, fluidized beds being reported as the most suitable reactors for biomass and wastes, under several different possible combinations of operational parameters. A critical discussion is presented, aiming to contribute to a more profound understanding of this matter, its key points and noteworthy potential.
