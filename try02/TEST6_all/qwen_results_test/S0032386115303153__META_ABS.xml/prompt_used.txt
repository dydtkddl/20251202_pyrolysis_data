You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flammability and thermal degradation of poly (lactic acid)/polycarbonate alloys containing a phosphazene derivative and trisilanollsobutyl POSS This work reports our recent efforts on improving the flame retardancy and thermal stability of biodegradable poly (lactic acid) (PLA) which is usually produced from corn and sugar beets. Hexa-(phosphaphenanthrene-methyl-(p-hydrobenzal)-amino-phenoxyl)-cyclotriphosphazene (HPHAPC) was synthesized by the classic Kabachnik-Fields reaction, and was then incorporated into PLA/polycarbonate (PC) alloys by melt blending. The flammability evaluation by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertically burning (UL-94) and cone calorimeter tests has indicated that the LOI value can reach up to 31.5 and UL-94 grade can pass V-0 by the presence of only 3 wt% HPHAPC and 3 wt% polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). The thermal behavior characterization by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows that the char formation of PLA/PC alloys can be significantly enhanced by the presence of HPHAPC/POSS. The evolved gas of the alloys was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-TGA (FTIR-TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Char morphology was observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). It is demonstrated that HPHAPC can react with POSS during processing to form an intumescent char structure. It is proposed that the degradation products of HPHAPC/POSS can capture free radicals in the gas phase and enhance char formation in the condensed phase.
