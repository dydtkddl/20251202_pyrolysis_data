Hierarchically three-dimensional bicontinuous monoliths: Fabrication strategies, mechanisms, functionalization and applications Hierarchically bicontinuous materials are known for their unique structural and functional properties. Among them, hierarchically three-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous monoliths (HTBMs) have attracted increasing attention in a wide range of applications, i.e., catalysis, separation and purification, immobilized enzymatic reactor, adsorption and removal of pollutant, CO2 capture and energy storage etc. In practical applications, these monoliths are featured with low back-pressure, high permeability, and high surface areas, which can significantly reduce diffusion distances, boost mass transfer efficiency, minimize diffusion barriers and increase the availability of active sites within the materials. These advantages have spurred the development of various strategies for the preparation and application of HTBMs. Currently, monoliths are mainly divided into four categories: inorganic oxides, natural polysaccharides, organic polymers, and organic–inorganic hybrid monoliths. Based on the material characteristics, researchers have developed a variety of effective methods for fabricating HTBMs. In this review, recent advancements in their fabrication strategies, mechanisms, functionalization and applications are comprehensively summarized.
