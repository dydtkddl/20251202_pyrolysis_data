You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hierarchically three-dimensional bicontinuous monoliths: Fabrication strategies, mechanisms, functionalization and applications Hierarchically bicontinuous materials are known for their unique structural and functional properties. Among them, hierarchically three-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous monoliths (HTBMs) have attracted increasing attention in a wide range of applications, i.e., catalysis, separation and purification, immobilized enzymatic reactor, adsorption and removal of pollutant, CO2 capture and energy storage etc. In practical applications, these monoliths are featured with low back-pressure, high permeability, and high surface areas, which can significantly reduce diffusion distances, boost mass transfer efficiency, minimize diffusion barriers and increase the availability of active sites within the materials. These advantages have spurred the development of various strategies for the preparation and application of HTBMs. Currently, monoliths are mainly divided into four categories: inorganic oxides, natural polysaccharides, organic polymers, and organic–inorganic hybrid monoliths. Based on the material characteristics, researchers have developed a variety of effective methods for fabricating HTBMs. In this review, recent advancements in their fabrication strategies, mechanisms, functionalization and applications are comprehensively summarized.
