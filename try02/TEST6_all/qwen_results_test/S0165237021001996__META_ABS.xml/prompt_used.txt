You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrating continuous-stirred microwave pyrolysis with ex-situ catalytic upgrading for linear low-density polyethylene conversion: Effects of parameter conditions A continuous-stirred microwave pyrolysis (CSMP) reactor coupled with an ex-situ catalytic bed was developed for the conversion of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) to high-grade fuels. Effects of catalyst-to-reactant ratio and feeding rate on product yield and chemical selectivity were studied. The CSMP of LLDPE produced up to 84.1 wt.% condensate product composed of hydrocarbon fuels. With the assistance of the ex-situ catalytic process with HZSM-5, more refined chemicals dominated by gasoline-range hydrocarbons (C5–C12 hydrocarbons) were observed. When the catalyst-to-reactant ratio was 15 % and the feeding rate was 6 g/min, the condensate oil with a high higher heating value (45.23 MJ/kg) showed the highest selectivity of gasoline-range hydrocarbons (98.0 %). The pyrolysis processes yielded ethylene as the main gas product. With the addition of HZSM-5, propylene and propane were the primary gas components. The plausible pathway for the conversion of LLDPE mainly proceeded through radical mechanism for pyrolysis and carbenium ion mechanism for catalysis was elaborated. The potential net energy gain increased from 34.16 MJ/kg to 48.91 MJ/kg with growing feeding rate from 6 g/min to 30 g/min.
