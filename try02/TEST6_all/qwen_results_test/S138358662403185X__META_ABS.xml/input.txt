Highly selective zinc ion removal by the synergism of functional groups and defects from N, S co-doped biochar Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a promising technology for selectively removing Zn2+ ions from industrial wastewater that contains a wide variety of ions. A key task in implementing effective CDI systems lies in the selection and optimization of electrode materials. In this work, a hierarchical porous biochar from the chestnut inner shell was developed by N, S element doping, providing a large ion-accessible surface area with abundant functional groups and defects. The increased defect sites (defect ratio of 1.09) and specific surface area (2029.1 m2 g−1) provided substantial sites for Zn2+ adsorption, and the specific functional groups endowed high Zn2+ selectivity. The N, S co-doped biochar achieved a Zn2+ adsorption of 706.4 μmol g−1 at 1.0 V and a selectivity factor of 14.9 against Na+. Importantly, the defects created by N doping enhanced the ion adsorption capacity, and N, S functional groups strengthened the selectivity of Zn2+ adsorption, which were elucidated by in situ Raman spectroscopy and further validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The N, S co-doped biochar with high adsorption capacity and excellent selectivity provides a novel insight for the treatment of wastewater with low Zn2+ concentration and further advances the practical application of CDI technology.
