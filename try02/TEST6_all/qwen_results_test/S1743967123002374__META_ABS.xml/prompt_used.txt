You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploration of the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics based on ReaxFF-MD and DFT Co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics is a strategy to achieve efficient waste management and obtain valuable fuels. In this paper, cellulose (CE) and polyethylene (PE) were chosen as representatives of biomass and plastics to investigate the synergistic effects of the main products during co-pyrolysis. The synergistic mechanisms are clarified at the microscopic level by ReaxFF-MD. Mainly, the ·H and CnHm· fragments from PE fracture combine with the intermediate products from CE cracking to generate additional oil and gas products. By using DFT theory to calculate the reaction energy barrier of the main products in the CE/PE co-pyrolysis process, it is found that the reaction energy barrier of furans and ethylene in the separate pyrolysis process is higher than that in the co-pyrolysis process, indicating that the co-pyrolysis process is more prone to reaction generation, leading to more significant synergistic effects. With the increase of temperature, the positive synergistic effect of product can be enhanced within a certain temperature range. But the synergistic oil yield then decreases with further increase of temperature. The synergistic effect is most significant when the material ratio is 1:1. More oxygenated compounds can be obtained by increasing the percentage of CE while more hydrocarbons can be obtained by increasing the percentage of PE.
