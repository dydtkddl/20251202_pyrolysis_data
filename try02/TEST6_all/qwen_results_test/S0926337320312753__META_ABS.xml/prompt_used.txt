You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CaO catalyst for multi-route conversion of oakwood biomass to value-added chemicals and fuel precursors in fast pyrolysis The impact of CaO on oakwood pyrolysis was explored by the Py-GC/MS at 500 °C. Ca(OH)2 presents on the CaO surface, indicating its partial hydration (noted as CaOOH). CaOOH promoted the ketonisation of carboxylic acids to aliphatic ketones, furfural to cyclopentanone/2-cyclopentenone, facilitated the elimination of the methoxy-phenolic compounds. The catalyst loading did not show any significant effect on the formation of acetone, while a noticeable reduction in the phenolics was revealed. Increasing catalyst loading almost eliminated CO2, acids, furans, aldehydes, ether groups, whilst the fractions of alcohols, esters, sugars, and alkoxybenzene decreased noticeably. The use of partially hydrated CaOOH in the CFP can create conditions where by-products generated during the ketonisation and phenolics upgrading reactions (CO2, H2O, CO) interact through the adsorption enhance water-gas-shift reaction and through coking reactions with formation of H2 used for hydrogenation during multistep conversion of furfural to cyclopentanone in a vapour phase.
