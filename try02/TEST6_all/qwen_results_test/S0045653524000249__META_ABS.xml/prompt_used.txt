You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The quantification of the airborne plastic particles of 0.43–11 μm: Procedure development and application to atmospheric environment The environmental degradation of microplastics results in ultrafine particles that may incur severe biological concerns. Despite this, the atmospheric existence of plastics of less than a few microns has barely been investigated due to the particle size limit of conventional analytical methods. This study develops a procedure to quantify and characterize plastic particles (including nanoplastics; less than 1 μm) in the air through fractional sampling, a simple pretreatment method, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pyr-GC/MS). We targeted 11 major polymers, namely, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin, styrene-butadiene rubber, polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide 6, and polyamide 66 (PA66). The average spike and recovery rate of each polymer in the aerosol collected on the roof of a four-story building near a major road in Kyoto, Japan, amounted to 78–130%, with a coefficient of variation of less than 15%. By coupling pyr-GC/MS analysis with fractional sampling of particles within the size range of >11 μm, 11–7.0 μm, 7.0–4.7 μm, 4.7–3.3 μm, 3.3–2.1 μm, 2.1–1.1 μm, 1.1–0.65 μm, 0.65–0.43 μm, it was possible to quantify airborne nano- and microplastics by particle size. Polyethylene, polystyrene, PET, and PA66 were detected in the air, and the total mass concentration of tiny plastic particles (0.43–11 μm) amounted to 1.20 μg/m3. This translates into total particle numbers of 3.05 × 106 particles/m3 (assuming spheres), revealing a substantial number of particles under 1 μm. These results will contribute to future studies to understand the atmospheric behaviors of ultrafine plastic particles and their flow-on effects on the respiratory system.
