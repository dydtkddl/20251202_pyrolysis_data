You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

SnO2-TiO2 materials for photocatalytic degradation of cationic dye under UV and visible light and a chitosan composite film investigation The possibility of SnO2 incorporation and immobilization as films forming composites opens new perspectives for TiO2 to profit visible light and to facilitate the photocatalytic process, respectively. In this study, 0 %, 1 % and 10 % wt. of SnO2 was incorporated into TiO2 (SnO2-TiO2) by coprecipitation in a sol-gel method by ammonia addition, followed for calcination at 500 °C. The photocatalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD Rietveld refinement, TG-DTG, SEM-EDS, DRS and elemental analysis. The performance of all solids was evaluated in the photocatalytic degradation of the cationic dye methylene blue in aqueous phase, under visible and UV irradiation, at 25 °C for 2 h. The results showed that the incorporation of Sn into TiO2 improved the textural properties and decreased the bandgap. All solids presented only TiO2 typical diffractograms, with anatase as the main phase, but catalyst with 10 % SnO2 presented also brookite phase, inferring that Sn atoms were incorporated into TiO2 structure, corroborated by MEV results. All tin-based photocatalysts show high activity under UV and visible light, with the 10 % SnO2 material reaching 83 % and 88 % degradation after 2 h under UV and visible radiation, respectively. This material was tested as an immobilized film, achieving 14 % of decolorization, and the reuse was also evaluated. Our investigation demonstrates that SnO2-TiO2 catalysts could be used to decompose a dye under UV and Visible light as powder in a batch reactor and immobilized as a composite film with chitosan, that opens new perspectives to facilitate the application using solar light.
