You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of rubbers and vulcanized rubbers using modified zeolites and mesoporous catalysts with Zn and Cu The pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading of vulcanized rubbers with metal modified zeolites were performed in order to improve oil quality and decrease sulfur content in pyrolytic oils simultaneously. Three vulcanized rubbers were synthesized by incorporating sulfur into natural rubber (NR), butadiene rubber (BR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) respectively. The catalysts of Cu/HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5, Cu/MCM-41 and Zn/MCM-41 were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method and were characterized by various means. TPD-NH3 indicated that the incorporation of Cu and Zn changed the density and strength of acid sites. Strong acidic sites were formed in Cu modified zeolites due to the occurrence of copper crystallization, which was also evidenced by XRD analysis. Due to the high dehydrogenation activity of the Lewis acidic sites introduced by the transition metals, the incorporation of Zn and Cu increased gas yields and markedly enhanced H2 formation at the expense of liquid products. GC-MS analysis showed that the catalysts can effectively reduce the polar aromatics content in pyrolytic oils. The lowest contents of polar aromatics in oils were obtained using Cu/ZSM-5, whilst the Zn/MCM-41 catalyst showed the highest selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Zeolites can promote the decomposition of sulfur-containing components in the liquid phase into gaseous products, which was enhanced by the incorporation of metals. The catalysts modified with Zn had a better removal efficiency of sulfur-containing components. XPS analysis indicated that the Cu and Zn modified catalysts achieved desulfurization by reacting with sulfur in pyrolytic volatiles to form stable CuS or ZnS.
