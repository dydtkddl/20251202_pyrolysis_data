Generation of micro(nano)plastics and migration of plastic additives from Poly(vinyl chloride) in water under radiation-free ambient conditions A batch experiment was conducted to observe the liberation of micro- and nano-sized plastic particles and plastic additive-originated organic compounds from poly(vinyl chloride) under radiation-free ambient conditions. The weathering of PVC films in deionized water resulted in isolated pockets of surface erosion. Additional ●OH from Fenton reaction enhanced PVC degradation and caused cavity erosion. The detachment of plastic fragments from the PVC film surfaces was driven by autocatalyzed oxidative degradation. Over 90% of micro-sized plastic particles were 500 nm) tended to be rapidly disintegrated into finer plastic particles (<500 nm), while the finest fraction of nanoplastics (<100 nm) could be completely decomposed and disappeared from the filtrates. The micro(nano)plastics generated from the PVC weathering were highly irregular in shape.
