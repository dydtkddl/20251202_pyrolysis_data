You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanoparticles for drug delivery: Insight into in vitro and in vivo drug release from nanomedicines Nanotechnology enables the achievement of the desired outcomes of nano-formulations, and the mode of drug delivery from the nanoparticles can significantly impact the efficacy of the embedded drug. This article reviews the various types of nanoparticles, methods of evaluating the drug release, in vitro-in vivo correlation, and regulatory challenges associated with nano-formulations. Nanoparticles have been classified into organic, inorganic, and hybrid nanoparticles. Several techniques, such as separated flow, continuous flow, and dialysis methods, have been utilized to assess nano-formulations' in vitro release. In vivo drug release evaluations in biological systems have also been demonstrated. Such evaluations often involve experimental models for the distribution of the nanoparticles, hematology, clearance, histopathology, and serum chemistry. Protein binding, enzymatic degradation, lipid absorption, carbohydrate absorption, and attachment to nucleic acid are some factors shown to affect drug release. In vitro-in-vivo correlation (IVIVC) involves the analysis of the drug release results and mathematical correlations. Factors such as the physicochemical properties of the nanoformulations, the subject’s physiological properties, and the formulation’s biopharmaceutical properties relative to the subject usually affect the correlation. Unlike previous reviews, this article uniquely combines mechanistic insights, production methods, stimuli-responsive systems, and regulatory considerations into a single reference, thereby offering a practical and translational perspective for researchers and formulators. This review also identifies current gaps in IVIVC standardization and highlights opportunities for advancing nanoformulation safety and efficacy.
