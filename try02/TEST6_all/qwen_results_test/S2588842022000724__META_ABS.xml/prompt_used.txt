You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An all-in-one zeolite@Ru–Al2O3 nanoplatform toward highly efficient, anti-coking, and recyclable hydrocarbon cracking catalysis Efficient utilization of hydrocarbon fuels holds great significance for the current vehicle low-emission requirements and future carbon-neutral society. However, the scenario that limits the effective fuel use and combustion is the present undesirable hydrocarbon-cracking catalysts of low activity, serious coking, and easy degradation. To tackle these issues, we rationally designed and synthesized an active, anti-coking, and recyclable all-in-one zeolite@Ru–Al2O3 catalyst on FeCrAl support by steam-assisted crystallization and atomic layer deposition. Ru nanoclusters dispersedly on ZSM-5 can boost the catalytic efficiency for hydrocarbon cracking and anti-coking, while the protective Al2O3 thin layers further ensure the reusable economy. As for n-dodecane (C12H26) cracking reaction, the ZSM-5@Ru–Al2O3 showed a high unit activity up to 0.1253%·ml·mg−1·min−1, low-carbon deposition rate, and the enhanced first-cycle carbon removal rate of 78.3% for recyclable use. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have further confirmed that high catalytic efficiency and low-carbon deposition benefit from the timely adsorption of C12H26 and timely transfer of reactant products at the composite interface. This work opens interesting possibilities for the rational design and fabrication of high-efficient, anti-coking, and recyclable hydrocarbon cracking catalysts through multifunctional structural regulations.
