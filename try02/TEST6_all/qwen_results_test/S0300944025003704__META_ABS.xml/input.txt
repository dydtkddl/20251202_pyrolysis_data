Rivet-like high-phosphorus-nitrogen-metal nanoparticles immobilized on the surface of MXene nanosheets for improved flame protection of epoxy coatings MXene, as an emerging two-dimensional nanomaterial, is expected to be an inorganic nano-flame retardant. Here, polydopamine (PDA) organic layers were first loaded onto MXene to enhance the flame retardancy and surface reactivity. Then, rivet-like nanoparticles formed by hexamethylene diamine tetramethylenephosphonic acid (HDTMP) containing high phosphorus‑nitrogen flame-retardant groups and metal ions (Cu2+ and Fe2+) were immobilized on the surface of MXene/PDA through coordination, obtaining the composite flame retardant MP@Fe-CuHP. The new composite flame retardant MP@Fe-CuHP effectively combined the barrier property of MXene, the excellent catalytic carbonization ability of metal ions, and the flame retardant function of N and P elements in the gas phase. The enhancement of fire resistance of waterborne epoxy coatings by MP@Fe-CuHP composite flame retardants was systematically explored. The results showed that the EP sample filled with MP@Fe-CuHP had the lowest backside temperature (168.6 °C) when directly facing the flame impingement compared to the other samples tested. Additionally, the MP@Fe-CuHP/EP samples reached the maximum expansion height and residual carbon amount of 23.3 mm and 30.3 %, respectively, which supports its high thermal insulation performance. Besides, the MP@Fe-CuHP/EP samples achieved the lowest peak heat release rate (PHRR, 443.12 kW/m2), total heat release rate (THR, 17.93 MJ/m2), peak smoke production rate (PSPR, 0.114 m2/s), total smoke production (TSP, 3.776 m2), peak CO production rate (PCOPR, 0.041 %), and peak CO2 production rate (PCO2PR, 0.332 %), confirming their excellent fire safety and flame retardant performance during the combustion. Therefore, the successful development of this nano-flame retardant can help to further expand the application of MXene in waterborne epoxy intumescent flame retardant coatings.
