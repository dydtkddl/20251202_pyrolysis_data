You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent development in the synthesis, modification and application of Mg(OH)2 and MgO: A review Magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide are compounds with favourable and unique properties, leading to a broad range of opportunities for their use in science, and above all in practical applications. This review describes methods of synthesising both Mg(OH)2 and MgO, including precipitation, solvothermal and hydrothermal processes, the sonochemical technique, the sol-gel, electrochemical and microwave methods, and paths based on calcination of magnesite, carbonatisation, and chemical vapour deposition. This comprehensive literature study provides extensive information on the properties and applications of these compounds and methods by which they may be obtained and modified. Reference is made to possibilities of using magnesium hydroxide as, among others, an antibacterial agent, a neutraliser of pollutants in fresh and wastewater, and a component of membranes, but the greatest detail is given in relation to the use of Mg(OH)2 as a flame retardant. Magnesium oxide, in turn, is characterised as an antibacterial agent and as a fire-resistant and insulating material. Particular attention is given to questions relating to the use of MgO as an adsorbent, as an active catalyst, and as a catalyst support. The latest developments in methods of modification of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide, divided into those carried out using organic compounds and those using inorganic compounds and metals, are also presented. A critical assessment of the current state of knowledge is presented, as well as indications of new directions for further research into the development of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. This review is a source of scientific as well as practical information on the possible applications of Mg(OH)2 and MgO at the present time and methods of obtaining them, in the light of available and applied research techniques and discoveries made to date in the field of advanced powder technology.
