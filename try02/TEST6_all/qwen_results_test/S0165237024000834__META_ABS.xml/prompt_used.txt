You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular-level kinetic modelling for the pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a two-stage process A two-stage process has been developed for the pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene to obtain light olefins, where probable mechanisms for each stage pyrolysis were proposed in our previous study. This work aims to establish molecular-level kinetic models for the first-stage pyrolysis at a lower temperature and for the second-stage pyrolysis at a higher temperature, respectively, to predict the overall reaction performances in accordance to the role of detailed mechanisms. A structure-oriented lumping (SOL) method based molecular-level kinetic model can effectively describe the first-stage pyrolysis, while a detailed molecular-level kinetic model is developed for the second-stage pyrolysis to track the evolutions of all alkanes, olefins, and diolefins, with special focus on the formation of light olefins. The established separate models can achieve the automatic generation of complex reaction networks and present good agreement with experimental data obtained from the first- and second-stage. In addition, the first-stage model indicates that the random scission plays an important role in the pyrolysis process at lower temperatures, while the chain-end scission mechanism dominates the second-stage reaction to produce light olefins at higher temperatures. As a whole, the molecular-level modelling scheme behaves excellently at a wide range of temperature, which provides guidance for upgrading the pyrolysis process.
