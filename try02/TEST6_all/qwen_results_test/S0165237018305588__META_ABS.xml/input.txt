Catalytic fast pyrolysis of rice husk over hierarchical micro-mesoporous composite molecular sieve: Analytical Py-GC/MS study In order to promote efficient production of hydrocarbons, catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of rice husk (RH) over catalysts is performed using Py-GC/MS. The catalyst is hierarchical micro-mesoporous composite molecular sieve prepared under different conditions including different concentrations (1.5 mol/L, 2.0 mol/L, 2.5 mol/L, 3.0 mol/L) of NaOH solution, different mass fraction of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution, different temperatures (90℃, 100℃, 110℃, 120℃) and durations (12 h, 24 h, 36 h). The fabricated hierarchical catalyst with HZSM-5 structure as the core and MCM-41 structure as the shell is characterized using N2 adsorption-desorption measurement and transmission electron microscopy. As the experimental results suggest, the highest value of total peak area of all the chemical compounds is obtained at 600℃. The fabricated hierarchical catalyst exhibit pronounced deoxygenation and excellent selectivity of aromatics. The maximum relative abundance of hydrocarbons (54%), maximum relative abundance of aromatics (39%) and value of selectivity of monocyclic aromatics (65%) are obtained by comparison with different hierarchical catalysts. Besides, the catalyzed transformation of large oxygenated compounds into hydrocarbons can be improved as a function of significant activation of hydrocarbon pool.
