You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis behaviors of biomass and polymer plastics by using reactive molecular dynamics simulation Co-pyrolysis of oxygen-rich biomass and hydrogen-rich plastic polymer is a promising approach for waste management, which has been investigated by using reactive molecular dynamics simulation (ReaxFF MD) in this work. The blend models containing multicomponent mixtures of polymer (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene) and biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) were constructed for the first time, which is close to the real utilization of waste materials. The simulation results show that the degree of positive synergistic effect between biomass and polymer increases with temperature, where the polymer promotes biomass pyrolysis and delays its recombination. Co-pyrolysis greatly affects the product yields through cross reactions of hydrogen and hydroxyl transfer, leading to more oxygen-containing bio-oils produced with the aid of polymers providing hydrogen. Produced from heavy tar at first and light char at late pyrolysis period, char precursors are generated more and faster in the co-pyrolysis system with more biomass because oxygen functional groups provide the initial cross-linking sites. As compared to pyrolysis of only binary components, the observed qualitative synergistic results in co-pyrolysis of biomass-polymer mixtures provide important insights into the detailed reactions for co-pyrolysis process, which can complement experimental observations to modulate the nature and yield of the desired bio-oils and bio-chars.
