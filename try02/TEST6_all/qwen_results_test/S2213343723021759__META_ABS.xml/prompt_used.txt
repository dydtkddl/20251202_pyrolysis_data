You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multivariate combined optimization strategy and comparative life-cycle assessment of biomass and plastic residues via microwave co-pyrolysis approach towards a sustainable synthesis of renewable hydrocarbon fuel The present study revealed the optimum co-pyrolysis process condition and simultaneously evaluated the environmental impact potential during co-valorisation of electronic plastic waste (WEEP) with Hydnocarpus de-oiled seed cake (HDSC) to produce renewable hydrocarbon fuel. In this work, the primary co-pyrolysis process parameters such as operating temperature, mixture ratio, and catalyst loading were modeled and optimized using a combined approach of both Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In the optimized condition, a maximum pyrolysis oil yield of 30.79 wt% was achieved at an operating temperature of 530 °C, a mixture ratio of 0.49, and catalyst loading of 20 wt%. The obtained co-pyrolysis products were characterized to evaluate their physiochemical properties. Finally, a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) of the scaled-up microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis plant has been modeled, and the result revealed that the emission levels of 771.95 kg CO2 eq, 3.11 kg SO2 eq, 1.69 kg PO4 eq, 338.59 DCB eq, and 0.11 kg C2H4 eq were projected for processing 1 tonne of feedstock. Further, sensitivity analysis revealed that a decrease of 15% in electricity consumption results in a reduction of the overall environmental impact by 13.69%. Above results demonstrate that microwave co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastic waste holds great potential for positive energy production and negative emission technology when compared to other waste management methods. Hence, this investigation paves the way for the sustainable conversion of e-waste plastic and biomass residue into renewable fuel and helps to achieve the sustainability goal of reducing GWP emissions.
