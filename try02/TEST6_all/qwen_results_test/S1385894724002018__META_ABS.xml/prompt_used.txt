You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into biomass mild gasification based on mass-energy balance: Establishing condition, thermodynamic mechanisms, and product properties To alleviate the challenge of gas and char quality competition arising from over oxidation during the biomass gasification. A new concept of biomass mild gasification based on mass and energy balance was proposed, wherein the energy produced during the oxidation stage precisely equals the energy consumed in the pyrolysis and reduction stages. An energy balance index (EBI), obtained through the combined use of TG-DSC-MS-FTIR and Gaussian model fitting to represent the relationship between mass loss and endothermic/exothermic properties among different reaction stages, was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) to obtain the critical conditions of biomass mild gasification. Under two typical mild gasification conditions, the quality characteristics of mild gasification biochar were analyzed and the gas evolution characteristics and sequence were determined through the combination of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D COS). The results indicated that mild gasification can be achieved within a heating rate range of 21 °C/min to 26 °C/min, with the oxidation temperature ranging from 776 °C to 869 °C. Under mild gasification conditions, the biochar produced at 850 °C-20 °C/min had higher COOH content, which can regulate soil pH, promote organic matter degradation, and enhance biological activity. Under the 800 °C-25 °C/min mild gasification condition, more CO and CH4 were generated during the pyrolysis stage, but slightly more CO2 was also produced during both the pyrolysis and oxidation stages. This work provides comprehensive thinking on the precious control of gasification process, which lays a foundation for co-generation of high-quality char and gas.
