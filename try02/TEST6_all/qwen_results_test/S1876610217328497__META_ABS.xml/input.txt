Potentials of pyrolysis processes in the waste management sector The fundamentals of pyrolysis, its latest developments, the different conditions of the process and their relative residues are of great importance to evaluate the applicability of the pyrolysis process within the waste management sector and waste treatments. In particular the type of residues and their further use or treatment is of extreme interest as they could become the source of secondary raw material or generate beneficial influence in waste treatments. The main area of focus of this paper is the investigation of the link between the pyrolysis conditions, the chemical and mineralogical composition of their products and the benefits of pyrolysis in the waste management sector. More specific the paper covers the fast, intermediate and slow pyrolysis of organic and a mixture of inorganic/organic charge from households. The catalysts influence during fast pyrolysis on products yields and composition is not being considered in the review.
