Review of chemical looping technology for energy conservation and utilization: CO2 capture and energy cascade utilization Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a promising CO2 capture technology, which expected to achieve 100% capture efficiency with a low energy penalty. The principle of CLC is utilizing an oxygen carrier as a medium for transporting oxygen between two reactors, aiming to avoid nitrogen in combustion exhaust. This article discusses the advances in chemical looping with a focus on oxygen carriers, reactors, coupling systems, and other applications of CLC concept for solid fuels. The development and design of high performance oxygen carriers and suitable reactors are key factors in the development of CLC technology. The main challenge in scaling up the CLC process is the development of appropriate OCs with optimal properties, including high transport oxygen capacity, reactivity, and stability. Recently, a fair number of hours of continuous operation in pilot plants have instilled the confidence required in further development of this process towards commercialization. The use of solid fuels is gaining momentum, and the liquid fuels need further attention for its development. The integrated systems based on chemical looping technology for poly-generation applications simultaneously achieve the efficient conversion and cascade utilization of chemical energy and CO2 separation. The article also describes the prospects of the future development in the chemical looping technology, and its viability for industrial deployment.
