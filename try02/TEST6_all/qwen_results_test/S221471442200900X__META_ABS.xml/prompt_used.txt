You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Destruction and entrainment of microplastics in ozonation and wet oxidation processes The global environmental worsening of microplastic (MP) pollution, particularly in water bodies, urges the search for treatments that can remove MPs from wastewaters, and, with this aim several processes have been investigated in the last years. This work analyses the use of wet oxidation and ozonation to remove real MPs from water, recovered from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). After 5 h of treatment, MP removals of 86.3 ± 1.7 % and 45.2 ± 1.3 % have been achieved by wet oxidation and ozonation, respectively. To know if the removal achieved was by reaction or by entrainment, similar experiments using inert gases have been carried out. A MP removal of 5.5 ± 2.0 % was obtained substituting O2 by N2 in wet oxidation setup and 43.4 ± 1.1 % when ozone was substituted by air. These results proved that most part of removal obtained by ozonation was due to entrainment of MP by the gas bubbling in an open reactor, whereas in the case of wet oxidation in a closed reactor chemical degradation was the main responsible for MP removal. Kinetic constants for the global processes were obtained and a model for MP entrainment has been proposed obtaining the kinetic constants for both, chemical reaction and entrainment. In the case of wet oxidation experiments, kinetic constants of 0.018 ± 0.007 h−1 and 0.395 ± 0.055 h−1 have been obtained for entrainment and chemical degradation, respectively. Finally, it has been shown that entrainment and chemical reaction occurred together with MP fragmentation.
