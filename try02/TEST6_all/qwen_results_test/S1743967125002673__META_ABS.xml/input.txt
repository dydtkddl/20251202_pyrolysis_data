Supercritical water gasification of plastic waste for hydrogen production: A review Plastic products are widely used in numerous domains due to their excellent physical properties and low cost. Their annual output has increased by over 200 times since 1950. Unfortunately, plastic products is challenging to recycle effectively, causing an extremely serious plastic pollution crisis in the global ecosystem. Converting plastic waste into clean hydrogen-rich fuel gas by supercritical water gasification is a greatly promising technology to eliminate plastic waste pollution and accelerate the development of circular economy of plastic materials. Compared with traditional plastic waste treatment technologies, supercritical water gasification remarkably reduces the emission of harmful substances and significantly enhances energy conversion efficiency. In this paper, the reaction mechanism and major influencing factors in the process of supercritical water gasification are reviewed. The effects of reaction conditions, such as temperature, feedstock concentration, reaction time, pressure and catalysts, on the reaction process are discussed. The characteristics and application scenarios of common reaction devices are introduced in detail. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities encountered by the supercritical water gasification of plastic waste are investigated. The goal is to propose a viable approach for clean and efficient treatment of plastic waste and realize the recycling of energy with the production of high value-added products.
