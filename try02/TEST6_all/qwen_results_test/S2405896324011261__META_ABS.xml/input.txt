A First-Engineering Principles Model for Dynamical Simulation of a Calciner in Cement Production We present an index-1 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model for dynamic simulation of a calciner in the pyro-section of a cement plant. The model is based on first engineering principles and integrates reactor geometry, thermo-physical properties, transport phenomena, stoichiometry and kinetics, mass and energy balances, and algebraic volume and internal energy equations in a systematic manner. The model can be used for dynamic simulation of the calciner. We also provide simulation results that are qualitatively correct. The calciner model is part of an overall model for dynamical simulation of the pyro-section in a cement plant. This model can be used in design of control and optimization systems to improve the energy efficiency and CO2 emission from cement plants.
