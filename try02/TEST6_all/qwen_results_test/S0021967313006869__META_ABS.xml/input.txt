In situ derivatization of metals and organometallics using borate reagents in gas chromatographic speciation studies Development of sensitive and selective analytical methods is required for trace metal and metalloids speciation analysis, including their alkyl-, phenyl- or other organometallic species. Gas chromatography is one of the most suitable techniques for effective separation of the above compounds however it requires that the analytes are volatile or semi-volatile. Today very popular derivatization methods make use of borate reagents for in situ derivatization of elements like Hg, Pb, Sn, Se, As, etc. Tetrahydroborates are suitable for hydride generation and alkylborates for alkylation of the inorganic ions of the above elements, as well as of several partially alkylated ones. This almost immediate reaction can be done in aqueous solutions and produces fully alkylated products of higher volatility suitable for separation by gas chromatography and measured by various detectors. The number of papers published in this field is constantly high, including many applications to various types of matrices, like biological, environmental, industrial, food, polymers, etc. For this reason, many articles of the last two decades are reviewed in this paper and emphasis is given to the use of borate reagents and the relative microreactions for selected elements.
