A review on the preparation, characterization, and applications of agro-waste-derived oligosaccharides Agro-waste is a significant global environmental hazard. Thus, the primary focus for achieving environmental sustainability is agro-waste usage. Efforts have been made to utilize lignocellulosic agro-waste as a source of biofuels for energy production. However, this biomass can also be utilized to manufacture prebiotic oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharides are little chains of monosaccharides, typically consisting of two to ten units of simple sugars. They are not broken down by human digestive enzymes and instead are metabolized by bacteria in the colon. These are extremely stable and are utilized as a dietary supplement with antioxidant, prebiotic and possible immune-modulating characteristics. The demand for innovative prebiotic compounds with enhanced functional qualities is experiencing a significant increase in the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Thus, this review provides an overview of several prebiotic sources, pretreatment techniques, preparation processes, production methods and applications. Furthermore, it investigates the wide array of applications for oligosaccharides obtained from agricultural waste. Thus, agro-waste can be converted into prebiotic oligosaccharides, simultaneously tackling environmental concerns and offering health advantages.
