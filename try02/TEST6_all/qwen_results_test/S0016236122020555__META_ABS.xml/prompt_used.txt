You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the catalytic performance of coal gangue char on biomass pyrolysis in a thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed bed reactor Developing low-cost and high-performance catalysts is an important part of the development of biomass pyrolysis technologies. In this study, the coal gangue rich in metals was used to directly prepare a char-supported catalyst, and metals in coal gangue were hoped to act as catalytic sites for in-situ biomass catalytic pyrolysis and secondary tar cracking. The influence of coal gangue char on pine pyrolysis behavior and kinetics was investigated in the thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed bed reactor. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that the addition of coal gangue char caused the movement of the initial weight loss temperature and the maximum weight loss peak of the samples to the high-temperature region. With the increase of the coal gangue char mass ratio, lower apparent activation energies of the samples were achieved in the conversion range of 0.2–0.8. Through fixed-bed isothermal pyrolysis experiments, it was found that the yield of gas increased with the increase of the coal gangue char mass ratio, while the tar yield decreased quickly. The yield of H2 and CO was significantly improved by the coal gangue char, further confirming the catalytic performance of coal gangue char on the cracking of tar molecules.
