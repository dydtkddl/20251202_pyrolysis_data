You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen bonding effects assisted organic ammonium polyoxometalate salts catalysis for the selective oxidation of methacrolein and mechanism study The selective oxidation of methacrolein (MAL) to methacrylic acid (MAA) is a key step in C4 oxidation for polymethyl methacrylate production, but the limited catalytic activity of polyoxometalates (POMs) hinders their industrial use. Here, we synthesized POM-IL hybrid catalysts via ion exchange and calcination. Ionic liquids disrupted the POM structure through hydrogen bonding, creating oxygen vacancies that optimized adsorption energy and prevented MAL over-oxidation to COx. The hydrogen bonding between ionic liquids and polyoxometalate anions, coupled with ammonium ions derived from ionic liquids, generated a synergistic effect that markedly improves the acidity and redox properties of the catalyst. The catalyst achieved 82.9 % MAL conversion, 88.9 % MAA selectivity, and exceptional stability over 80 h. In-situ infrared spectroscopy and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis identified Mo=Od as the active site, with ester intermediate formation as the rate-determining step. This study uncovers the influence of hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids on the structure-activity relationship of polyoxometalate anions, offering crucial insights into the mechanism of methacrolein selective oxidation.
