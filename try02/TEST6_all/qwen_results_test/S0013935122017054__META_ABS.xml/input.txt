A review on the role of susceptors in the recovery of valuable renewable carbon products from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of lignocellulosic and algal biomasses: Prospects and challenges Sustainable bio-economics can be achieved by the processing of renewable biomass resources. Hence, this review article presents a detailed analysis of the effect of susceptors on microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of biomass. Biomass is categorized as lignocellulosic and algal biomass based on available sources. Selected seminal works reporting the MAP of pure biomasses are reviewed thoroughly. Focus is given to understanding the role of the susceptor used for pyrolysis on the characteristics of products produced. The goal is to curate the literature and report variation in the product characteristics for the combinations of the biomass and susceptor. The review explores the factors such as the susceptor to feed-stock ratio and its implications on the product compositions. The process parameters including microwave power, reaction temperature, heating rate, feedstock composition, and product formation are discussed in detail. A repository of such information would enable researchers to glance through the closest possible susceptors they should use for a chosen biomass of their interest for better oil yields. Further, a list of potential applications of MAP products of biomasses, along with the susceptor used, are reported. To this end, this review presents the possible opportunities and challenges for tapping valuable carbon resources from the MAP of biomass for sustainable energy needs.
