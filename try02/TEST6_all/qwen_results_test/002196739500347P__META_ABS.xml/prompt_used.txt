You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon sorbents and their utilization for the preconcentration of organic pollutants in environmental samples This review deals with carbon sorbents and their utilisation to trace analysis of organic pollutants in environmental samples. The first sections are devoted to the general characteristics of various kinds of carbon sorbents, carbon formation, the structure of carbon, their classification and characterisation (activated charcoal, graphitized carbon black, carbon molecular sieves and porous carbon). Information is given on the development of carbonaceous adsorbents, their characteristics and properties, development of various preconcentration techniques, off-line or on-line combination with the analytical measuring system (GC and HPLC), and the application of carbon sorbents to the enrichment of analytes is evaluated. The main use of carbon materials as a preconcentration/preseparation step has been in the sampling and trapping of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from air and water matrices. An other field of application is the trapping of semi-volatile and non-volatile compounds and/or their separation into subclasses. According to the characteristics of the sampled components, carbon sorbents have been utilised in single-bed or multi-bed arrangement (combination of various carbon sorbents or combinations of carbon sorbents with other non-carbonaceous materials) to achieve quantitative trapping of trace components from environmental samples, followed by their desorption for subsequent identification and quantitation. Various achievements and problems, particularly in multicomponent-mixture analysis, are discussed. The physico-chemical properties of recently developed carbon adsorbents are superior compared to those of the “traditional” sorbent materials. Over the recent years much attention has been paid to the application of carbon sorbents for the on-site automated analysis and monitoring of trace pollutants.
