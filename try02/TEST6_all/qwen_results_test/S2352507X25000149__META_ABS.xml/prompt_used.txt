You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of MWCNTs for successive polymeric and nano modification of a Nigerian bitumen, optimization using response surface methodology Polyethylene (PE) is attractive as a bitumen modifier for several reasons, the most important of which is cost. However, polymeric bitumen is highly sensitive to PE dosages and suffers thermal degradation. To develop a tougher, more ductile crack-resistant binder, a ternary mixture was formulated using PE-modified binder and Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs). The conventional properties of PE-modified bitumen were optimized using a mixture design and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). MWCNTs (0.1 – 0.3 wt%), mixing time (20 – 40 min) and speed (1000 – 15000 rpm) were considered for ternary modification at 140 °C. The softening and penetration points as well as ductility were used to determine the best mix. MWCNT was synthesized using a carbon vapour deposition method and characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), which indicates cylindrical-shaped CNT with numerous walls; Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) indicates crystalline graphitic carbon with a weight loss of 25.96 %; X-ray Diffraction (XRD), which indicates graphene-like layers of tube walls at 2θ values of 25.89° and 44.53°. Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) shows surface area, pore size and pore volume of 0.62 m2/g, 15.91 nm and 0.00362 cm3/g, respectively. The developed models for the modified bitumen are predictive (R2 greater than or equals to 0.94). The optimum mix design for polymeric bitumen was 4.07 wt% PE, and 95.83 wt% bitumen and 0.1 wt% MWCNT, 1500 rpm mixing speed and 37.7 min for the ternary bitumen. The relatively small absolute relative error between experimental and simulation indicated the reliability of the final models with a combined desirability of 0.77 – 0.87.
