You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates production from laboratory to industrial scale: A review Environmental issues related to fossil-based plastics are getting the attention of the media and legislative authorities, addressing the need to improve the plastics' design, collection, and circular economy. In this regard, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) represent a promising alternative to the conventional polymers, given their biological origin, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. To date, their commercialization covers only a little percentage of the biodegradable plastic application, mainly due to their high cost. However, new production strategies are being investigated and patented, enhancing the PHA market competitiveness. This review tries to fill the gap about the critical investigation on innovative and up-to-date process strategies in PHA production field, deeply evaluating them from a plant-engineering point of view. Several aspects are considered regarding the reduction of the production costs and the increase in the overall PHA productivity and recovery. Among them, the feeding of pre-treated carbon sources derived from food and agro-industrial wastes, the use of mixed microbial cultures as convenient substitutes to the pure ones, and optimized downstream processes are widely discussed. The overlook of the topic is completed by evaluating the innovative technologies existing at pilot and industrial scale, able to achieve improved production yields. Finally, PHA economic and market current conditions are investigated.
