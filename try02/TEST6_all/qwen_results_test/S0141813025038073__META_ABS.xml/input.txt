Polyhydroxyalkanoates production from laboratory to industrial scale: A review Environmental issues related to fossil-based plastics are getting the attention of the media and legislative authorities, addressing the need to improve the plastics' design, collection, and circular economy. In this regard, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) represent a promising alternative to the conventional polymers, given their biological origin, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. To date, their commercialization covers only a little percentage of the biodegradable plastic application, mainly due to their high cost. However, new production strategies are being investigated and patented, enhancing the PHA market competitiveness. This review tries to fill the gap about the critical investigation on innovative and up-to-date process strategies in PHA production field, deeply evaluating them from a plant-engineering point of view. Several aspects are considered regarding the reduction of the production costs and the increase in the overall PHA productivity and recovery. Among them, the feeding of pre-treated carbon sources derived from food and agro-industrial wastes, the use of mixed microbial cultures as convenient substitutes to the pure ones, and optimized downstream processes are widely discussed. The overlook of the topic is completed by evaluating the innovative technologies existing at pilot and industrial scale, able to achieve improved production yields. Finally, PHA economic and market current conditions are investigated.
