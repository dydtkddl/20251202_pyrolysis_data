You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upgrading polyethylene plastic waste into a biodegradable polymer: Harnessing a hybrid chemical oxidation–biological conversion approach Plastic has garnered significant attention due to the urgent need for effective recycling methods to address its environmental impacts. However, upcycling methods for polyethylene (PE), the most prevalent plastic in use today, have not advanced significantly because its inert structure requires harsh chemical processing conditions. In this study, we present a mild chemical oxidation process using CeO2 as the catalyst to convert polyethylene waste into oxygenates, which are suitable substrates for biological conversion. This process utilizes a heterogeneous catalyst that enhances the separation of reaction products and reduces the risk of metal contamination in subsequent biological processes. Importantly, this method uses an eco-friendly oxidant (O2) and solvent (water), aligning with sustainable practices. Chemically oxidized raw polyethylene derivatives were used as the sole carbon source for the growth of Cupriavidus necator H16, facilitating the biological upgrading of these derivatives into the biodegradable polymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). This hybrid process achieved overall PHB yields of 0.22 g PHB/g PE for polyethylene powder, 0.21 g/g for low-density polyethylene bags, and 0.28 g/g for high-density polyethylene bottles. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the highest PHB production achieved among previously studied hybrid processes that combine chemical oxidation and biological conversion of polyethylene. This integrated approach offers a promising strategy for producing biodegradable materials and advancing the closed-loop upcycling of plastic waste.
