You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reaction decoupling in thermochemical fuel conversion and technical progress based on decoupling using fluidized bed Thermochemical conversion of fuels via pyrolysis/carbonization, cracking, gasification and combustion has to involve a number of individual reactions called attribution reactions to form an intercorrelated reaction network for any conversion process. By separating one or some attribution reactions from the others to decouple their interactions existing in the reaction network, the so-called reaction decoupling enables a better understanding of the complex thermal conversion process and further the optimization of the conditions for attribution reactions as well as the entire conversion process to realize advanced performances. The dual bed conversion and two-stage conversion are the two representative types of fuel conversion technologies developed in recent years based on reaction decoupling. Many technical advantages have been proven for such decoupling fuel conversion technologies, such as poly-generation of products, low-cost production of high-grade products, elimination of undesirable products or pollutants, easy operation and control, and so on. The treated fuels with decoupling conversion technologies mainly include solid biomass and coal, as well as liquid petroleum oil. This paper is devoted to reiteration of the reaction decoupling concept and further to reviewing the research, developments and successful applications of several decoupling fuel conversion technologies of two such types by using fluidized bed as their major reactors.
