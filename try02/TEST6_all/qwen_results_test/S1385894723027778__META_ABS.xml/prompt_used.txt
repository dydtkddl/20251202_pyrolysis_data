You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermogravimetric kinetic analysis of catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis of simulated municipal solid waste Municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal through landfill and incineration represents a costly and hazardous challenge to global health, and loss of underutilised resource for the circular economy. Thermal pyrolysis of the organic components of MSW offers a scalable route to liquid fuels, but process optimisation requires deep insight into the associated thermochemistry and kinetics. Here we apply thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and kinetic modelling to the (catalytic) pyrolysis of a model MSW feedstock comprising cellulose, sucrose, sugarcane bagasse and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste, with or without Al-SBA-15, MM-Al-SBA-15 or HZSM-5 catalysts, occurs in three main stages, namely the melting and concomitant evaporation of volatiles, and subsequent decomposition of carbohydrate, then LDPE and finally lignin components. The rate of non-catalytic MSW pyrolysis increased with sample heating rates (from 20 to 120 °C /min) but had little impact on the temperature or mass loss during each stage. Catalytic pyrolysis is sensitive to the catalyst:feedstock mass ratio; increasing this ratio from 1 to 5 increased mass losses during the removal of volatiles and three subsequent decomposition stages, while lowering the temperature of LDPE decomposition. Kinetic analysis by Friedman’s isoconversional method reveals a monotonic increase in activation energy for each stage of (non-catalytic and catalytic) MSW pyrolysis. However, energy barriers for individual stages decreased with increasing catalyst:feedstock ratio and were sensitive to the catalyst type: Al-SBA-15 offers the largest decrease in barriers for carbohydrate (−86 kJ/mol) and LDPE decomposition (−92 kJ/mol), and similar promotion to HZSM-5 for lignin decomposition (∼100 kJ/mol), at the highest catalyst content. TGA is an effective tool for catalyst selection and process optimisation provided heating rates < 60 °C /min are employed, above which pyrolysis appears heat transfer limited.
