You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of hydrothermally pre-treated microalgae residue and polymeric waste (plastic/tires): Comparative and dynamic analyses of pyrolytic behaviors, kinetics, chars, oils, and in-situ gas emissions Biomass and polymeric wastes are becoming more problematic economically and environmentally. Their co-pyrolysis could be a cost-effective and environmentally preferable alternative for reducing waste quantities and gas emissions, as well as recovering valuable oils, chars, and gases. This study aimed to dynamically characterize the co-pyrolysis of hydrothermally treated Chlorella sorokiniana residue (CSR) and waste polymers (polystyrene (PS) and waste tires (WT)) based on their pyrolytic behaviors, kinetics, interaction effects, bio-chars, bio-oils, and in-situ evolved gasses characteristics. The devolatilization of CSR mainly occurred between 150 and 500 °C, while the decomposition of WT and PS appeared between 200–550 °C and 300–550 °C, respectively. The average activation energy was 179.25, 222.82, and 223.12 kJ/mol for the CSR, WT, and PS devolatilization, respectively. The TG-FTIR-detected functional groups included CH (stretching vibration), CH (in-plane & out-of-plane bending vibration), CC, CO2, OH, CO, COOH, CO, and NH3. The TG-MS-detected pyrolytic products were CHO+, CH3O+, C2H3O+, C3H3O+ C3H6O+, C4H3O+, C5H6O+, COOH+, NH3 +, aliphatic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, the pyrolytic oil was found to be more stable, with significantly fewer N- and O-containing compounds. It seemed that the inclusion of PS and WT in CSR pyrolysis reduce the additional fuel processing requirements to transform liquid yields into useful fuel. This research findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the control and application potential as well as the limitations of the high-value energy and products derived from the co-pyrolysis of CSR, PS, and WT.
