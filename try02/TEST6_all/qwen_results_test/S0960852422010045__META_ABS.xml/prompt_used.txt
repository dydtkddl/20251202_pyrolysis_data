You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment of lignocellulosic waste: Evaluating anaerobic biodegradability and environmental impacts In the present study, yard waste was pretreated by thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion to improve its anaerobic biodegradability. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized using Box–Behnken design based response surface methodology for the maximum organic matter solubilisation. Then, the possible mechanism of delignification by thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment was discussed. Moreover, the anaerobic digestion performance of untreated yard waste (UYW) and pretreated yard waste (PYW) was compared. The optimum pretreatment condition based on the increase in soluble COD and volatile solids (VS) was: 2997 kJ/kgTS ultrasonic energy, 74 °C, and 10.1 pH. The highest methane yield of 374 ± 28 mL/gVSadded for the PYW at the optimum condition was achieved, which was 37.5 % higher than the UYW (272 ± 16 mL/gVSadded). Finally, the environmental impacts associated with anaerobic digestion of both UYW and PYW were compared. The life cycle assessment confirmed a positive environmental impact of pretreatment.
