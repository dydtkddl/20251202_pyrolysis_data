You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermocatalytic degradation of common polymers: A microscale combustion calorimetry study This paper presents the first application of the microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) to study catalyzed pyrolysis of the practical polymers comprising most of currently produced plastic wastes. The polymers considered include olefines (HDPE, LDPE, and PP), PS, PMMA, PET, PC, and PVC. Each of the polymers is mixed with one of the two catalysts, ZSM-5 or MgO, and the measurements are undertaken for the catalyst mass fractions of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 at several heating rates ranging from 15 to 60 K/min. Strong catalytic effect of ZSM-5 has been demonstrated for the polyolefin polymers (HDPE, LDPE, and PP). Such effect manifests itself in a significant reduction of characteristic pyrolysis temperatures and apparent activation energy; the latter is shown to decrease greatly (by a factor of about two) when the catalyst is added. As the catalyst mass fraction increases up to 0.1 (0.2 for LDPE + ZSM-5 mixture), the saturation is attained, and further addition of the catalyst has no effect. The heat of combustion of pyrolysis volatiles does not reveal a definitive dependence on the catalyst mass fraction, while in some cases the width of pyrolysis temperature interval as well as the char yield are affected. Decomposition of the remaining polymers in presence of ZSM-5 or MgO is either catalyzed rather weakly or even inhibited such as that in PS + ZSM-5 mixture. Among the polymers examined, PC turns out to be the only polymer that is considerably catalyzed by MgO. For the mixtures in which significant catalytic effect was detected, the formal kinetic models have been derived from the microscale measurements and shown to replicate the MCC data at different heating rates. These polymers, both individually and mixed with the catalyst, are often characterized by the non-monotonic conversion function which cannot be approximated by the n-th order reaction model.
