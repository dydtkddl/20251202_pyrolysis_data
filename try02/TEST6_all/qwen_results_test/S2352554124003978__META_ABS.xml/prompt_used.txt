You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic analysis and pyrolysis behavior of organic fraction of municipal solid waste towards the production of renewable fuel: A sustainable approach to resource recovery for circular economy Valorization of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OF-MSW) for bioenergy production is a widely adopted approach. In view of the requirements for scaling up, optimization and design of the pyrolysis reactor, the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior, reaction mechanism along with product characterization has rarely been explored. In the present study, physicochemical analyses, kinetic, and thermodynamic study of OF-MSW were performed using TGA thermograms obtained at four heating rates (5, 10, 20, and 40 °C min−1) under nitrogen atmosphere. Model-free methods, viz Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), and Friedman (FRD) models were employed to determine the mean activation energies (E o ), which were found to be 153.84, 155.48 and 159.41 kJ mol−1 respectively. These values are consistent with those calculated by the combined kinetic (CK) model. The pyrolysis mechanisms based on the CK model involve a single-step process and can be represented as f(α)=(1-α) 1.50075 α −1.0606 . The frequency factor, ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS using FRD model were found to be 3 × 10 12 s−1, 164.82 kJ/mol, 155.46 kJ/mol and -32.74 J mol−1 K−1 respectively. Additionally, Criado method with Y(α) master plots were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism. It was observed that at the initial conversion stage, second order and first order reaction mechanisms were predominant followed by D3 (three-dimensional diffusion) at higher conversion. The bio-oil and biochar obtained were further characterized in terms of physico-chemical and spectroscopic techniques to explore its potential in environmental and energy applications. By embracing the circular economy concept, we can transform OF-MSW from a linear “take-make-dispose” into valuable resource stream.
