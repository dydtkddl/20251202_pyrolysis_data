You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma combined with cross-linking: An innovative way to modify the multi-scale structure and physicochemical properties of corn starch Cold plasma is a low-cost, simple and green method for starch modification. In the present study, the impact of corn starch modification by cold plasma (CP, 1, 3 and 9 min), sodium trimetaphosphate/sodium tripolyphosphate (CL, 1 %, 5 % and 10 %) and their combination were investigated. CP-pretreatment had enhancement of phosphorus content and substitution degree. Neither CP nor CL destroyed the starch granules morphology. Instead, CP induced more short-chain to better rearrange the starch during the crosslinking process, which improved the efficiency of the crosslinker in the subsequent crosslinking process. Therefore, compared with CL or CP, the thermal transition temperatures increased after CP pretreatment, while the amylose content, relative crystallinity, swelling power, and △H decreased. Meanwhile, CP-pretreatment changed the internal structure of the CL-starch so that it showed the lowest enzymatic digestibility. CP pretreatment provides a promising way to improve cross-linked starch's structure, properties, and efficiency.
