You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergetic biofuel production from co-pyrolysis of food and plastic waste: reaction kinetics and product behavior This study aimed to develop a process for producing bio-oil, char, and value-added chemicals from food waste and plastic waste blend using co-pyrolysis under controlled conditions. The food waste (rice, vegetables, and fish) was blended in definite ratios (70:30, 60:40, and 50:50 w/w) with polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Experiments were conducted at various temperatures (250, 300, and 350 °C) and reaction times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min). A kinetic analysis was performed to fit experimental data, and reaction kinetics were observed to follow Arrhenius behavior. Maximum yields of bio-oil and bio-char, 66 and 40 wt% respectively, were attained at 350 °C, with yields being strongly influenced by variations in temperature and weakly affected by variations in reaction time. Co-pyrolysis promoted the formation of carboxylic acid, hydrocarbons, and furan derivatives. Formation of carboxylic acid could be increased by increasing the ratio of plastic waste. A maximum carboxylic acid content of 42.01% was achieved at 50% of plastic waste. Meanwhile, a maximum aliphatic hydrocarbon content of 44.6% was obtained with a ratio of 70:30 of food waste to plastic waste at 350 °C. Overall, pyrolysis of food and plastic waste produced value-added compounds that can be used as biofuels and for a variety of other applications.
