You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combined thermochemical-biotechnological approach for the valorization of polyolefins into polyhydroxyalkanoates: Development of an integrated bioconversion process by microbial consortia Waste management of persistent polymers such as polyolefins (PO)1 still represents a major challenge, often leading to material loss from the value chain and contributing to plastic pollution. This study investigated an integrated process to valorize PO pyrolysis side stream. PO wax was recovered and used as a feedstock for a microbial bioconversion process. A modified emulsification protocol (using two-surfactants system) allowed the successful dispersion and bioconversion of PO wax without the need of the extra oxidation step. Enrichment of plastic landfill inocula allowed to develop efficient mixed microbial consortia (MMC) able to grow on PO wax. Adaptive laboratory evolution improved 4 times cell growth, leading to 2.6–17.3 times shorter lag phase. The bioconversion process using the adapted MMC was performed in a 2 L-bioreactor with PO wax-emulsified media (10 g L−1) at neutral pH and 20% pO2. 87% of substrate was consumed within 12 h and complete consumption was achieved within 48 h (4 times faster than previously reported). A maximum of 2.95 gCDW L−1of biomass was produced, while the intracellular triglycerides reached a maximum of 105.5 mg L−1 at 30 h. Moreover, the conversion of PO wax into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) was demonstrated and the production was maximized by statistical optimization. Maximum PHA titer of 384 0.1 mg L−1 was achieved, which represents a 1.5–17 times improvement from previous reports. This integrated thermochemical-biotechnological approach might represent an interesting strategy to valorize and upcycle currently unrecyclable PO-rich mixed plastic waste streams, thus improving the circularity of the plastic sector.
