Combined thermochemical-biotechnological approach for the valorization of polyolefins into polyhydroxyalkanoates: Development of an integrated bioconversion process by microbial consortia Waste management of persistent polymers such as polyolefins (PO)1 still represents a major challenge, often leading to material loss from the value chain and contributing to plastic pollution. This study investigated an integrated process to valorize PO pyrolysis side stream. PO wax was recovered and used as a feedstock for a microbial bioconversion process. A modified emulsification protocol (using two-surfactants system) allowed the successful dispersion and bioconversion of PO wax without the need of the extra oxidation step. Enrichment of plastic landfill inocula allowed to develop efficient mixed microbial consortia (MMC) able to grow on PO wax. Adaptive laboratory evolution improved 4 times cell growth, leading to 2.6–17.3 times shorter lag phase. The bioconversion process using the adapted MMC was performed in a 2 L-bioreactor with PO wax-emulsified media (10 g L−1) at neutral pH and 20% pO2. 87% of substrate was consumed within 12 h and complete consumption was achieved within 48 h (4 times faster than previously reported). A maximum of 2.95 gCDW L−1of biomass was produced, while the intracellular triglycerides reached a maximum of 105.5 mg L−1 at 30 h. Moreover, the conversion of PO wax into polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) was demonstrated and the production was maximized by statistical optimization. Maximum PHA titer of 384 0.1 mg L−1 was achieved, which represents a 1.5–17 times improvement from previous reports. This integrated thermochemical-biotechnological approach might represent an interesting strategy to valorize and upcycle currently unrecyclable PO-rich mixed plastic waste streams, thus improving the circularity of the plastic sector.
