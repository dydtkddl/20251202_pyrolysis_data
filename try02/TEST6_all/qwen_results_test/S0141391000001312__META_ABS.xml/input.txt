Pyrolysis of mixed polyolefins in a fluidised-bed reactor and on a pyro-GC/MS to yield aliphatic waxes Polyolefins (PE, PP and PS) were pyrolysed in a fluidised-bed reactor on kilogram scale at 510°C. Pyrolysis products were analysed with GC, GC/MS and other methods. It was shown that valuable products, mostly aliphatic waxes, are received from polyolefins. It was also investigated if mixtures of different polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) interact with each other in fluidised bed pyrolysis yielding different pyrolysis products than received from the pure, individual polyolefins. The same polymer mixtures were also analysed using a pyro-GC/MS-device.
