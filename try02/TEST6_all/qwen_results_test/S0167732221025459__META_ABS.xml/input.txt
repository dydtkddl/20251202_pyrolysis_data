Multi-dimensional applications of graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterials – A review Over the years, significant effort has been devoted to the applications of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterials due to their outstanding properties. Which include thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, non-toxicity, low-cost, metal-free nature, large surface area, optical, ease of preparation, environmental friendliness, biocompatibility and chemical inertness. In this article, the various applications and prospects of g-C3N4 materials in biomedicine, sensors, energy conversion and storage, hydrogen production, mixed matrix membranes for water treatment, and photocatalytic degradation of aqueous organic pollutants has been critically reviewed. Moreover, key aspects of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and the suitability of g-C3N4 as photocatalyst have been covered. The review also discusses theoretical aspects, attributes, current trends/challenges and future considerations associated with the energy and environmental application of g-C3N4 nanostructures. It is believed that this review will provide a current comprehensive knowledge of the applications of g-C3N4 to readers and researchers to identify research gaps and could inspire researchers to synthesize novel g-C3N4-based materials for use in potential diverse fields.
