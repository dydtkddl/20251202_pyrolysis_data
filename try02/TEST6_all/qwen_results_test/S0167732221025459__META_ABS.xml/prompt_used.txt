You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-dimensional applications of graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterials – A review Over the years, significant effort has been devoted to the applications of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterials due to their outstanding properties. Which include thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, non-toxicity, low-cost, metal-free nature, large surface area, optical, ease of preparation, environmental friendliness, biocompatibility and chemical inertness. In this article, the various applications and prospects of g-C3N4 materials in biomedicine, sensors, energy conversion and storage, hydrogen production, mixed matrix membranes for water treatment, and photocatalytic degradation of aqueous organic pollutants has been critically reviewed. Moreover, key aspects of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and the suitability of g-C3N4 as photocatalyst have been covered. The review also discusses theoretical aspects, attributes, current trends/challenges and future considerations associated with the energy and environmental application of g-C3N4 nanostructures. It is believed that this review will provide a current comprehensive knowledge of the applications of g-C3N4 to readers and researchers to identify research gaps and could inspire researchers to synthesize novel g-C3N4-based materials for use in potential diverse fields.
