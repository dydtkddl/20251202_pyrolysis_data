You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance assessment of a demonstration-scale biomass gasification power plant using material and energy flow analyses In this study, biomass gasification was investigated in a 1.5 MWth bubbling fluidized bed demonstration plant using air or an air/steam mixture as gasifying agent, and olivine as bed material. The gasification tests were performed in autothermal conditions and keeping constant the equivalence ratio at 0.30. The gasification products, such as producer gas, elutriated particles, tar, and contaminant gases were comprehensively characterized. Moreover, the performance of the whole gasification plant and that of its specific process units were quantitatively assessed by employing material and energy flow analyses. The results indicated that steam addition improved the producer gas quality by promoting tar and char conversion into permanent gases, thus increasing the producer gas specific yield, even if the lower heating value of the producer gas and cold gas efficiency slightly decreased. Material flow analysis highlighted that the carbon conversion efficiency was mainly affected by the carbon loss due to the solid particles collected by the cyclone, while energy flow analysis revealed that the cold gas efficiency was significantly influenced by the energy the system used to convert the starting biomass into producer gas. The biomass conversion efficiency into electrical energy was about 24 %.
