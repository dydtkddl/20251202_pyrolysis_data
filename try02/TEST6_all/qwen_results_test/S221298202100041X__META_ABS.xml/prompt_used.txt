You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plasma-catalytic dry reforming of methane over Ni-supported catalysts in a rotating gliding arc – Spouted bed reactor A combination of a rotating gliding arc and a spouted catalytic bed was investigated in a plasma-catalytic system for dry reforming of methane (DRM). Different nickel-based catalysts, including Ni supported on Al2O3 or SiO2 (fresh and passivated) with 0, 15, and 30 wt % Ni, were investigated. It was found that a more stable operation of the plasma-catalytic system was obtained with the Al2O3-supported catalyst rather than with the SiO2 catalyst. A noticeable increase in selectivity towards CO and H2 was obtained with a catalytic bed in the plasma zone, reducing acetylene production, a byproduct of DRM, when carried out under plasma conditions. A maximum selectivity of CO of 96.7 % was obtained for the combination of plasma and passivated 30Ni/SiO2. For H2, the maximum selectivity achieved was 84.9 % for plasma + fresh 15NiO/SiO2. Additionally, the formation of soot and coke in the reactor was strongly reduced by the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst characterization showed that the plasma introduces defects on the Ni catalyst, making it more electronegative. However, the crystalline structure of the catalyst was not affected by contact with the plasma, suggesting that the change in the surface chemistry might affect the performance of the catalyst during the DRM reaction.
