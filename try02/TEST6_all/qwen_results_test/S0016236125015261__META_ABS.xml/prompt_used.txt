You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Measurements of NOx emissions from biomass combustion in small to large-scale power plants NOX emissions from thermal conversion are among the most serious gaseous emissions. The role of combustion technology and combusted biomass or biogenic residue on these emissions is not yet fully understood. This study investigates the gas composition at four different biomass-fueled combustion power plants, focusing on nitrogen species. The thermal energy input of the industrial-sized combustion facilities are 0.9MWth, 40.4MWth, 105MWth and 154MWth. These four facilities with different combustion technologies also employ different fuels, e.g., wood chips, waste wood, straw and pencil residues. The measurements are conducted simultaneously with a two-measuring point approach entailing flue gas measurements near the particle filter and stack, and gas measurements in the combustion chamber. A specially designed high-temperature probing lance is implemented to collect gas from the combustion chamber before the gas is analyzed with a Fourier-transformed infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The resulting NOX emissions are dependent on the fuel and the combustion technology. The conversion of the fuel-bound nitrogen to NOX at the stack, which ranged between 1.1% and 5%, correlates with the fuel nitrogen content and the elemental composition of the fuel across the combustion plants. Moreover, NO was the main nitrogen species detected inside the combustion chambers.
