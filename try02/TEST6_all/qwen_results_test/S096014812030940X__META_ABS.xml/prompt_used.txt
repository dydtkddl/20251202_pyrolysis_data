You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemically assisted pyrolysis of rice straw in molten carbonates The pyrolysis of rice straw as a feedstock in molten carbonates pyrolysis (MCP) and electrochemically assisted molten carbonates pyrolysis (EMCP) systems was investigated in this study. Molten carbonates (MC) were utilized as both the heat transfer medium and the electrolyte in EMCP. The results suggested that EMCP helped to reduce the formation of tar and water, while promoting the formation of gases, especially CO2. The optimum reaction conditions were 600 mA/cm2 of current density in a particle size of 3 mm at 550 °C, with the maximum H2 and CH4 yields of 0.26 mol/100 g and 0.17 mol/100 g, and the yield of hydrocarbons peaked at 5.0%. EMCP system reinforced the reaction by accelerating the reaction rate rather than reducing the activation energy. The electrochemical process facilitated the conversion of the hydroxyl groups and a fraction of the carbonyl groups in the biomass to carboxyl groups, which then underwent decarboxylation to release CO2 in the MC medium. Because oxygen atoms were removed from the system as CO2, the water formation decreased. The EMCP system showed benefits in the synthesis of hydrogen and hydrocarbons, and opened a novel pathway for the deoxygenation of biomass in pyrolysis.
