Solvolysis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether/anhydride model networks The chemical recycling by solvolysis of epoxy resins, in particular those of the type including bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA) cured by anhydrides, appears rather easy. The association of titanium(IV) n-butoxide (TBT) and diethyleneglycol (DEG) catalyst/solvent system proved effective. The depolymerisation of a model matrix, as well as composite waste, is pushed practically to the monomer stage. The glycolysis products are constituted by esterdiols, tetraalcohols and excess of glycol. The excess solvent can be eliminated by distillation under vacuum, without re-equilibration reactions towards the formation of higher molar mass species. Solvolysis by monoethanolamine (MEA) has also been studied. The reaction is more effective but the depolymerisation products are solid. Characterization of the depolymerisation products by NMR and Maldi-Tof has confirmed the reaction mechanism of transesterification and the presence of other alcoholysis side reactions.
