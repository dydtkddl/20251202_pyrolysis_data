You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of ammonia and COD removal from municipal wastewater effluent by electrochemical continuous flow reactor equipped with Ti/RuO2 and Cu foam The aim of the present work was to study an electrochemical continuous-flow reactor for the removal of ammonia nitrogen ( N H 4 + N), its by-product, and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) from synthetic and real municipal wastewater effluent. In this study, Ti/RuO2 electrode was prepared by the thermal decomposition method for the removal of NH4-N and COD. Characterization of the Ti/RuO2 was accomplished using FE-SEM, EDS, AFM, and XRD. Cyclic voltammetry and Tafel curves were used for the electrochemical feature of the Ti/RuO2 electrode. Box-Behnken Design (BBD) method was used to optimize the operating conditions. The effects of four independent parameters including the initial concentration of N H 4 + (10–30 mg/L as N), Cl− concentration (100–500 mg/L), HRT (30–100 min), and current (0.4–1.4 A) were examined using continuous experiments for the removal of N H 4 + N and COD. Characterization results confirmed that RuO2 was successfully coated on the surface of titanium mesh. Optimum conditions for Cl− concentration, HRT, and current were 490 mg/L, 100 min, and 1.36 A, respectively for an effluent concentration of 30 mg/L N H 4 + N and 30 mg/L of COD. Under these conditions, the removal efficiencies of N H 4 + N and COD were respectively 97.79 and 89.64 %, and the concentration of N O 3 − N was 1.93 mg/L. This work highlights the importance of an electrochemical continuous flow reactor for further removal of nitrogen and COD from the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants.
