You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on preparation of aromatic-rich oil by thermal dechlorination and fast pyrolysis of PVC Thermal dechlorination and fast pyrolysis experiments of PVC were carried out. Characterizations such as TG, FTIR and 13C NMR were applied to analyze the thermal degradation characteristics and chemical structure evolution characteristics of de-HCl PVC during the dechlorination process. The thermal dechlorination results show that the degree of dechlorination and aromatization of de-HCl PVC is deepened with the increasing dechlorination temperature. The dechlorination efficiency is as high as 99.86% at 320 ℃. Meanwhile, the de-HCl PVC with a chlorine content of 0.22% and the optimal H/Ceff value for aromatics production can be obtained. The de-HCl PVC gradually evolves from a long chain structure with C-C bonds as the skeleton to a long olefin chain structure with partial aromatization during the dechlorination process. The fast pyrolysis results show that the oil generated by the de-HCl PVC (320 °C) pyrolysis has a high aromatic content of 97.32%−99.93%. In addition, there are no chlorine-containing compounds in the oil from de-HCl PVC (320 °C) pyrolysis, while the PVC pyrolysis oil contains chlorinated aromatics with high content of 1.91%−4.02%. During the fast pyrolysis process, the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) are mainly formed from the cyclization of polyene fragments released by random fragmentation of de-HCl PVC (320 ℃). Further, the polycondensation reaction is promoted to realize the conversion of MAHs to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under the action of high temperature. The by-products of pyrolysis gas with high HHV and carbon-rich char both can be further utilized. Overall, thermal dechlorination and fast pyrolysis can realize harmless treatment and high-value utilization of PVC.
