You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study on the pyrolysis and leachability of washed/unwashed electric arc furnace dust-PVC mixtures and their residues In this work, the pyrolysis behavior of electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) mixed with poly(vinyl) chloride (PVC) was studied under inert conditions. Unwashed (UW) EAFD was found to contain lead hydroxychlorides which were converted to hydrocerrusite upon washing. It also contains appreciable amounts of soluble salts such as halite and sylvite; the effect of these salts on the pyrolysis behavior of EAFD-PVC mixtures was investigated. These salts delayed the dechlorination of PVC, by at least 20 ⁰C, during the pyrolysis of EAFD-PVC and altered the mineral composition of the pyrolysis residue. The later was rich in PbCl2, FeCl2. H2O for both unwashed (UW) and washed (W) EAFD samples. However, the W-EAFD-PVC residue was rich with ZnCl2. H2O, which was not detected in the UW-EAFD-PVC pyrolysis residue. Instead, it is believed that UW-EAFD-PVC pyrolysis residue is rich with the metastable Na2ZnCl4 as well as K2FeCl5. H2O and NaFeCl4. The capturing and monitoring of the released gases during the pyrolysis of UW- and W-EAFD-PVC mixture, confirmed the inhibiting effect of the halite and the sylvite on the dehydrochlorination of PVC. The released gases demonstrate a strong evidence of the solid-solid reaction between EAFD compound (mainly ZnO) and PVC without evolution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) at temperatures below 200 ⁰C. The subsequent leaching of the pyrolysis residue has resulted in the recovery of Zn (up to 100%), Fe (up to 64%) and Pb (up to 76%) in water. It is inferred that decreasing iron recovery can be achieved by oxidizing Fe+2, while increasing Pb recovery can be achieved by controlling the pH of the leachate solution.
