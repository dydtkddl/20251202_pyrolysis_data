Thermal decomposition of polymer mixtures of PVC, PET and ABS containing brominated flame retardant: Formation of chlorinated and brominated organic compounds The thermal decomposition of various mixtures of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS), ABS containing brominated epoxy resin flame retardant and Sb2O3, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) has been studied in order to clarify the reactions between the components of mixed polymers. More than 40 halogen-containing molecules have been identified among the pyrolysis products of mixed samples. Brominated and chlorinated aromatic esters were detected from the mixtures containing PET and halogen-containing polymers. A series of chlorinated, brominated and mixed chlorinated and brominated phenols and bisphenol A molecules have been identified among the pyrolysis products of polymer mixtures containing flame retarded ABS and PVC. It was established that the decomposition rate curves (DTG) of the mixtures were not simple superpositions of the individual components indicating interactions between the decomposition reactions of the polymer components. The maximal rate of thermal decomposition of both ABS and PET decreases significantly if the mixture contains brominated epoxy flame retardant and Sb2O3 synergist. The dehydrochlorination rate of PVC is enhanced in the presence of ABS or PET.
