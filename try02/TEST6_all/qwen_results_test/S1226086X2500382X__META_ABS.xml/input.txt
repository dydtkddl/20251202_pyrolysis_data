Carbon quantum dots synthesized from a lemon extract in ethyl acetate to enhance the performance of polylactic acid films for packaging applications This study describes a promising approach for synthesizing environmentally friendly carbon quantum dots (CQDs) using a hydrothermal method that utilizes a lemon extract and ethyl acetate (EA) as a non-aqueous solvent. The resulting EA-derived CQDs (ECQDs) possessed significantly enhanced morphological, thermodynamic, and functional properties as compared with those of CQDs generated through conventional aqueous synthesis methods. Pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) data confirmed the full conversion of the lemon extract into ECQDs during EA treatment. These ECQDs were incorporated into polylactic acid (PLA) to develop nanocomposite films for food-packaging applications. Photoluminescence spectra revealed that the synthesized ECQDs possessed a bandgap of 2.9 eV, which is beneficial for various applications. The fabricated PLA/ECQD films demonstrated an impressive ultraviolet (UV)-blocking efficiency of 82 % within the UV-B spectrum, enhancing the protection of packaged foods. In addition, the incorporation of ECQD solutions significantly increased antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus species with optimized PLA/ECQD nanocomposite films achieving growth inhibition rates above 90 % for these bacterial strains. The outstanding antimicrobial and barrier properties of PLA/ECQD films highlight their application potential in food preservation and packaging, presenting an effective strategy for improving food safety and extending the shelf lives of various products.
