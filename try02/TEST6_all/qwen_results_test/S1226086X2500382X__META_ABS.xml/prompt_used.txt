You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon quantum dots synthesized from a lemon extract in ethyl acetate to enhance the performance of polylactic acid films for packaging applications This study describes a promising approach for synthesizing environmentally friendly carbon quantum dots (CQDs) using a hydrothermal method that utilizes a lemon extract and ethyl acetate (EA) as a non-aqueous solvent. The resulting EA-derived CQDs (ECQDs) possessed significantly enhanced morphological, thermodynamic, and functional properties as compared with those of CQDs generated through conventional aqueous synthesis methods. Pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) data confirmed the full conversion of the lemon extract into ECQDs during EA treatment. These ECQDs were incorporated into polylactic acid (PLA) to develop nanocomposite films for food-packaging applications. Photoluminescence spectra revealed that the synthesized ECQDs possessed a bandgap of 2.9 eV, which is beneficial for various applications. The fabricated PLA/ECQD films demonstrated an impressive ultraviolet (UV)-blocking efficiency of 82 % within the UV-B spectrum, enhancing the protection of packaged foods. In addition, the incorporation of ECQD solutions significantly increased antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus species with optimized PLA/ECQD nanocomposite films achieving growth inhibition rates above 90 % for these bacterial strains. The outstanding antimicrobial and barrier properties of PLA/ECQD films highlight their application potential in food preservation and packaging, presenting an effective strategy for improving food safety and extending the shelf lives of various products.
