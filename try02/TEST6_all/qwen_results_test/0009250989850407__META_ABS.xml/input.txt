A non-isothermal grid model for catalytic fluidized-bed reactors Gas enters a fluidized bed through jets which at a given height are stopped and the gas flow divided between bubbles and the dense phase. To describe the non-uniform mixing of the catalyst, the grid region, with a height equal to the jet penetration depth, is divided into three zones one above the other: the dead region, the quasi-dead region and the intermittently mixed region. Each of them and the dense phase are considered with lumped parameters. The jet and bubbles are assumed to be in plug flow. The catalytic reaction occurs in the three grid zones and the dense phase. There is mass and heat transfer between each of the grid zones and the jet, and between the dense phase and the bubble phase. The bubbles cause the solid movement between the three grid zones and the dense phase. There is heat transfer from the grid zones and the dense phase to the surroundings, especially through the cooling tubes. This model accounts for the thermal gradients reported in some industrial fluidized-bed reactors. It seems to be well suited to fast exothermic catalytic reactions.
