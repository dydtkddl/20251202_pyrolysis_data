Preparation of spherical WMoNbTa refractory high entropy alloy powder by radio frequency plasma and its laser powder bed fusion densification The fabrication of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) with balanced mechanical properties remains challenging due to inherent brittleness and defect sensitivity during additive manufacturing. In this work, high-quality spherical WMoNbTa RHEA powder was synthesized through an innovative spray granulation (SG) and radio frequency plasma spheroidization (RFPS) hybrid approach, achieving >98 % spheroidization efficiency and low impurity levels (O: 850 ppm, C: 350 ppm). The optimized RFPS process enabled uniform single-phase BCC powder with enhanced flowability (8.5 s/50 g) and tap density (8.33 g/cm3), critical for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) densification. Coupled with volumetric energy density (VED) optimization, macrocrack-free LPBF samples were fabricated, though micropores and grain boundary microcracks persisted due to rapid solidification stresses. Subsequent hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1350 °C/150 MPa/4 h eliminated microdefects, suppressed oxygen segregation at grain boundaries, and promoted full recrystallization, resulting in a 17.1 % increase in ultimate compressive strength (1716 MPa) and 31.1 % enhancement in fracture strain (11.8 %) compared to the as-built sample. This work pioneers a dual-process synergy: (1) SG-RFPS for high-purity spherical RHEA powder synthesis and (2) LPBF-HIP for defect-tolerant microstructure engineering, offering a scalable strategy to overcome the strength-ductility trade-off in RHEA additive manufacturing.
