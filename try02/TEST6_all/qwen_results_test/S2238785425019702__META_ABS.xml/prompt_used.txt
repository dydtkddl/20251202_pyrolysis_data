You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of spherical WMoNbTa refractory high entropy alloy powder by radio frequency plasma and its laser powder bed fusion densification The fabrication of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) with balanced mechanical properties remains challenging due to inherent brittleness and defect sensitivity during additive manufacturing. In this work, high-quality spherical WMoNbTa RHEA powder was synthesized through an innovative spray granulation (SG) and radio frequency plasma spheroidization (RFPS) hybrid approach, achieving >98 % spheroidization efficiency and low impurity levels (O: 850 ppm, C: 350 ppm). The optimized RFPS process enabled uniform single-phase BCC powder with enhanced flowability (8.5 s/50 g) and tap density (8.33 g/cm3), critical for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) densification. Coupled with volumetric energy density (VED) optimization, macrocrack-free LPBF samples were fabricated, though micropores and grain boundary microcracks persisted due to rapid solidification stresses. Subsequent hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1350 °C/150 MPa/4 h eliminated microdefects, suppressed oxygen segregation at grain boundaries, and promoted full recrystallization, resulting in a 17.1 % increase in ultimate compressive strength (1716 MPa) and 31.1 % enhancement in fracture strain (11.8 %) compared to the as-built sample. This work pioneers a dual-process synergy: (1) SG-RFPS for high-purity spherical RHEA powder synthesis and (2) LPBF-HIP for defect-tolerant microstructure engineering, offering a scalable strategy to overcome the strength-ductility trade-off in RHEA additive manufacturing.
