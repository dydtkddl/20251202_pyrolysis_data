You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic liquefaction of coal with supercritical water/CO/solvent media This paper describes studies of the catalytic activity of cobalt molybdenum sulphide, cobalt molybdenum oxide, iron sulphate, iron acetate dibasic and H2S during the reaction between supercritical CO and water, and during liquefaction of coal using supercritical CO-water-solvent mixtures. The kinetics of the water gas shift reaction was studied first and was found to be first order in all the catalysts studied. The activity of the catalysts decreased in the following order: cobalt molybdenum sulphide > cobalt molybdenum oxide > iron salts. The presence of toluene, tetralin, and THQ decreased the CO conversion on the cobalt catalysts but increased CO conversion in the presence of iron salts catalysts. Moderate coal conversion of toluene soluble products (25%–35%) were obtained in the presence of supercritical water and water/CO mixtures. Addition of organic solvents to a supercritical water/CO medium increased conversion of toluene soluble products to 70–80% for THQ, to 50–60% for tetralin, and to 35–40% for toluene. Addition of H2S to the solvent/water/CO medium increased conversion to toluene soluble products even further. In the presence of H2S/solvent/water/CO, the presence of catalysts had only a minor effect on coal conversion and were not required to achieve high coal conversions. The optimum operating conditions for an Illinois No. 6 coal were obtained using a H2S/THQ/CO/water medium at 3600 psi, and 400 °C. Higher conversions were attained with a subbituminous Wyodak coal. These studies clearly demonstrate that high conversions to soluble products can be attained using a supercritical water/Co/solvent medium.
