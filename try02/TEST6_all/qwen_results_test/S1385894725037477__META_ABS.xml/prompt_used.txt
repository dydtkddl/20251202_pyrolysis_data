You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advance in design techniques and synthesis strategies of porous carbon positive electrodes for aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitors Aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitor (ZIHC) is a kind of hybrid energy storage and conversion devices, which combines the energy storage mechanism of aqueous zinc-ion batteries and supercapacitors to realize ideal electrochemical energy storage. Recently, great research efforts have been devoted to further development of novel positive electrodes to achieve high capacitances and energy densities of ZIHCs. Compared to other electrode materials, carbon-based materials exhibit higher conductivity, greater stability, lower toxicity, and enhanced environmental compatibility, making them particularly attractive. To achieve high capacitance, porous nanostructure engineering is essential by designing porous carbon materials with high specific surface areas and ideal porous structures. These features increase the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, as well as shorten the ion diffusion pathways. Therefore, various design and synthesis strategies of carbon electrodes with precisely controlled porous structures have been developed. This review summarizes recent design techniques and synthesis strategies for creating diverse porous carbon positive electrodes, specifically focusing on template methods, chemical activation methods, structural engineering, and multi-method collaboration, as well as the effect of porous structures for the electrochemical performance of aqueous ZIHCs are discussed. Some existing challenges and prospects for the innovative development of porous carbon positive electrode design are also proposed.
