Advance in design techniques and synthesis strategies of porous carbon positive electrodes for aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitors Aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitor (ZIHC) is a kind of hybrid energy storage and conversion devices, which combines the energy storage mechanism of aqueous zinc-ion batteries and supercapacitors to realize ideal electrochemical energy storage. Recently, great research efforts have been devoted to further development of novel positive electrodes to achieve high capacitances and energy densities of ZIHCs. Compared to other electrode materials, carbon-based materials exhibit higher conductivity, greater stability, lower toxicity, and enhanced environmental compatibility, making them particularly attractive. To achieve high capacitance, porous nanostructure engineering is essential by designing porous carbon materials with high specific surface areas and ideal porous structures. These features increase the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, as well as shorten the ion diffusion pathways. Therefore, various design and synthesis strategies of carbon electrodes with precisely controlled porous structures have been developed. This review summarizes recent design techniques and synthesis strategies for creating diverse porous carbon positive electrodes, specifically focusing on template methods, chemical activation methods, structural engineering, and multi-method collaboration, as well as the effect of porous structures for the electrochemical performance of aqueous ZIHCs are discussed. Some existing challenges and prospects for the innovative development of porous carbon positive electrode design are also proposed.
