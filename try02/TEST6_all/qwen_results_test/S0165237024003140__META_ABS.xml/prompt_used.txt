You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis kinetic analysis and model constructions of different ranks of coal and validation by GA–BP neural networks In the current steel industry, environmental pressures are mounting. If the reducing gases generated from coal pyrolysis can be utilized for reducing iron ore, the goal of low-carbon production with controllable costs can be achieved. However, the release of volatile content in coal has a significant impact on the pyrolysis process and final products. Therefore, in this study, the pyrolysis characteristics and gaseous products of four types of coal with different volatile matter content was investigated by thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) technology. The results showed that coals with higher volatile matter content demonstrated stronger reactivity during pyrolysis. As the volatile matter content in coal increased, the starting temperature for releasing the reducing gases decreased, leading to a significant increase in the released gas volume. In addition, the three kinetic factors were calculated by isoconversional method, distribution of the activation energy model (DAEM) and Coats-Redfern (CR) method respectively, and the pyrolysis reaction mechanism function suitable for all coal types was reconstructed based on common solid reaction models. Finally, a predictive model based on a GA-improved back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was developed, which useing 21 input parameters to predict the TG curves, activation energy (E), lnA and mechanism function ( f α ) and achieving R 2 values above 0.95. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the pyrolysis mechanism of coals with different volatile matter content, providing scientific guidance for effective utilization.
