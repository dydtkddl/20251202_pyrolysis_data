You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal and thermo-catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene waste Thermal and thermo-catalytic cracking behaviour of a commercial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) waste was investigated in the temperature range of 400–450°C in a laboratory scale pyrex batch reactor. An equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FCC), HZSM-5 and a clinoptilolite containing rhyolite tuff were used as catalysts. The presence of a catalyst significantly altered both the yield and composition of the products and differences were found between catalysts having different acidities, micro- and macropore surface areas. The yield of gases increased in the order: non-thermo-catalytic cracking < clinoptilolite < FCC < HZSM-5 catalysed cracking, while the yields of liquid products increased in the sequence of non-thermo-catalytic cracking < clinoptilolite < HZSM-5 < FCC catalysed cracking. The catalysts significantly affected the isomerization of the olefin double bond and of the carbon-chain of the cracked products, the olefin content of liquids did not differ considerably. The effect of the catalysts on the yields and structure of products were getting less significant with increasing cracking temperature. The range of the carbon atom number in liquids was C5–C28 in non-thermo-catalytic cases, whereas using catalysts it was C5–C25, but the temperature of cracking had a noticeable effect on the distribution of carbon atom. Each liquid fraction is of low sulphur content, which may be advantageous for application as fuel.
