You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Shunt resistance criterion: Design and implementation for industrial silicon solar cell production Silicon solar cell current–voltage (I-V) curve measurement is the final characterization procedure used in a photovoltaic (PV) industrial line. The illumination I-V curve measurements are of interest because they determine the solar cell power, relegating to dark characteristic in second place. Nevertheless, the growth of PV-building-integration can increase the possibility of the hot-spot phenomenon. The most effective approach to reduce this PV module failure is to directly identify and segregate malfunctioning cells in the production line. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to design a suitable silicon solar cell pass/fail protocol and to implement it in an industrial solar cell tester. This work focuses on the definition of a protocol for any industrial measurement tool for dark and reverse-biased conditions. The defined criterion includes three different orders: the first one segregates harmful Type I PV cells that exhibit a high hot-spot possibility, the second order separates solar devices that exhibit very high current leakage, and the third order separates PV cells with a double condition: Type II behavior that is very close to Type I with assembled power. This proposed dark-reverse measurement protocol has been appropriately defined for 125d150 and 150d195 PV cell sizes, and different batches for each size have been sorted using this scheme. The work also highlights the relevance of an in-line dark-reverse measurement criterion in a production-quality system. Finally, real size PV modules have been fabricated and they overcome the hot-spot endurance test.
