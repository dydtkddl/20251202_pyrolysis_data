You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Long-lived metal-zeolite catalysts for polyolefin aromatization via synergistic tandem dehydroaromatization and hydrogenolysis Converting waste plastics directly into valuable aromatic chemicals is a promising, cost-effective recycling strategy. Traditional zeolite-catalyzed cracking of polyolefins to produce aromatics often needs high temperatures and faces issues like low selectivity for liquid aromatics, separation difficulties, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. To address this, a multifunctional Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst was developed to efficiently upgrade various polyolefins—including polyvinyl chloride—into gaseous alkanes (C1–C5) and easily separable liquid aromatics (C6–C12) at 400 °C, without added solvents or hydrogen. Aromatic products make up 57.1 wt% of total output, with more than 97.8 % selectivity for the liquid phase and a BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity of 76.1 %. The high activity and selectivity for aromatics stem from synergistic interactions between Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and acid sites in the zeolite, which promote selective C–C bond breaking and control hydrogenolysis and aromatization pathways. This synergy allows precise control over the distribution of products by carbon number and favors the formation of separable aromatics. Notably, the catalyst also prevents coking by hydrogenolyzing and hydrogenating reactive intermediates before they form stable graphite-like deposits. Consequently, Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates excellent stability, maintaining consistent aromatics yield over 13 consecutive cycles and processing over 30 times its weight in plastics without regeneration. After regeneration, the activity of the catalyst was fully restored, highlighting its potential for industrial use. This work offers valuable insights for designing durable, high-activity catalysts, providing a practical route to improve plastic recycling technologies.
