Research progress on lignin based supercapacitor electrode materials: preparation, properties, and challenges In the 21st century, portable electronic products have become the mainstream development trend, and the development of supercapacitors with high power density, long cycle life, and fast charging and discharging capabilities is of great significance. In recent years, lignin based porous carbon has been widely studied in the field of supercapacitor electrode materials due to its environmental friendliness and the additional pseudocapacitance provided by oxygen-containing groups. This article reviews the preparation methods and optimization strategies of lignin based supercapacitor electrode materials, as well as the feasibility of using natural lignin precursors for supercapacitors. The synergistic mechanism between preparation methods and optimization strategies is discussed. Finally, the challenges currently faced by lignin based porous carbon electrode materials, limitations of existing technologies, and future research directions for improving the performance of lignin based carbon were emphasized.
