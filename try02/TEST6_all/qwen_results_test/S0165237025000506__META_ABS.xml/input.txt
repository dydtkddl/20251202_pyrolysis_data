Co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polystyrene via infrared heating to produce light aromatic hydrocarbons The co-pyrolysis of coal and waste plastics is a viable method for achieving efficient and clean utilization of coal and waste and enhancing light aromatic hydrocarbon production. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polystyrene (PS) was carried out via rapid infrared heating in a fixed bed reactor with varying mixing ratios to investigate the product distribution, tar composition, and char characteristics. The results revealed that the increase of PS mixing ratio increased the interaction of the co-pyrolysis volatiles, which raised the tar and light aromatic hydrocarbons yield. Especially for the mixing ratio of coal/PS being 7:3, the content of styrene and ethylbenzene in tar is 31.5 % and 15.2 % higher than the theoretically calculated value, respectively. Moreover, co-pyrolysis promoted the interaction between volatiles to produce biphenyls such as 1,3-diphenylpropane. Electron paramagnetic resonance results indicated that the co-pyrolysis char exhibited higher amounts of methoxy ether and 1–3 cyclic π quinone free radicals, which was consistent with the decrease of phenols in the tar.
