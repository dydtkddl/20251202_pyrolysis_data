You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polystyrene via infrared heating to produce light aromatic hydrocarbons The co-pyrolysis of coal and waste plastics is a viable method for achieving efficient and clean utilization of coal and waste and enhancing light aromatic hydrocarbon production. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of Pingshuo coal and polystyrene (PS) was carried out via rapid infrared heating in a fixed bed reactor with varying mixing ratios to investigate the product distribution, tar composition, and char characteristics. The results revealed that the increase of PS mixing ratio increased the interaction of the co-pyrolysis volatiles, which raised the tar and light aromatic hydrocarbons yield. Especially for the mixing ratio of coal/PS being 7:3, the content of styrene and ethylbenzene in tar is 31.5 % and 15.2 % higher than the theoretically calculated value, respectively. Moreover, co-pyrolysis promoted the interaction between volatiles to produce biphenyls such as 1,3-diphenylpropane. Electron paramagnetic resonance results indicated that the co-pyrolysis char exhibited higher amounts of methoxy ether and 1–3 cyclic π quinone free radicals, which was consistent with the decrease of phenols in the tar.
