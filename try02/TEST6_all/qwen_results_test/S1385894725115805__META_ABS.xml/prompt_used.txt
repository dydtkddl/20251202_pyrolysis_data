You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling plastic waste into high-value gases via pulsed joule heating for economic and carbon benefits Plastic waste poses growing environmental and health risks due to incineration and landfilling, which result in low energy recovery, high carbon emissions, and toxic byproducts. This study presents a pulsed joule heating approach without additional catalysts that upcycles diverse plastic wastes into high-value combustible gases, using recyclable graphite paper as a precisely controlled conductive heating medium. Product distribution is tunable via current and pulse settings: lower currents and pulse counts favor monomer recovery (yielding on average > 50 wt% olefins), while higher inputs enhance dehydrogenation, achieving hydrogen-rich gas with 99.4 ± 8.7 wt% hydrogen recovery. The process is validated using real-world plastic wastes. At a global scale, and assuming a realistic plastic waste feedstock (33.6 % polypropylene, 46.3 % polyethylene, 10.9 % polyethylene terephthalate, 9.2 % polystyrene) with scalable conversion efficiency, replacing conventional incineration with pulsed joule heating could reduce CO2-equivalent emissions by 66.6 % (190 million tons annually) and increase energy recovery 4.4-fold, corresponding to an economic benefit of USD 18.1 billion through gas valorization. This electrified strategy compatible with renewable electricity supply offers a scalable and low-carbon solution for sustainable plastic waste management.
