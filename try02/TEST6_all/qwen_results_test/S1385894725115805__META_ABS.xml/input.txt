Upcycling plastic waste into high-value gases via pulsed joule heating for economic and carbon benefits Plastic waste poses growing environmental and health risks due to incineration and landfilling, which result in low energy recovery, high carbon emissions, and toxic byproducts. This study presents a pulsed joule heating approach without additional catalysts that upcycles diverse plastic wastes into high-value combustible gases, using recyclable graphite paper as a precisely controlled conductive heating medium. Product distribution is tunable via current and pulse settings: lower currents and pulse counts favor monomer recovery (yielding on average > 50 wt% olefins), while higher inputs enhance dehydrogenation, achieving hydrogen-rich gas with 99.4 ± 8.7 wt% hydrogen recovery. The process is validated using real-world plastic wastes. At a global scale, and assuming a realistic plastic waste feedstock (33.6 % polypropylene, 46.3 % polyethylene, 10.9 % polyethylene terephthalate, 9.2 % polystyrene) with scalable conversion efficiency, replacing conventional incineration with pulsed joule heating could reduce CO2-equivalent emissions by 66.6 % (190 million tons annually) and increase energy recovery 4.4-fold, corresponding to an economic benefit of USD 18.1 billion through gas valorization. This electrified strategy compatible with renewable electricity supply offers a scalable and low-carbon solution for sustainable plastic waste management.
