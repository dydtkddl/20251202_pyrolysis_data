You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biodiesel: A comprehensive review of properties, catalyst types, and feedstock sources Current biodiesel production faces three primary bottlenecks: variability in feedstock quality, difficulties in scaling laboratory-scale processes to industrial levels, and substantial life cycle carbon emissions. Addressing these challenges requires the development of feedstock-flexible processes, scalable reactor designs, and strategies to minimize environmental impacts. This review provides a comprehensive examination of biodiesel production, emphasizing catalyst development and feedstock selection. Catalysts are categorized into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and biocatalysts, with particular focus on the sustainability and economic advantages of waste-derived heterogeneous catalysts. For example, calcium oxide–based catalysts derived from biomass and industrial-derived waste residues can lower production costs by up to 20 % while maintaining high conversion yields (>95 %), process scalability, and life cycle assessment. Biodiesel characterization is addressed through advanced analytical techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) for functional group identification, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) for conversion verification, and gas chromatography (GC) for assessing purity and composition, ensuring conformity with ASTM and EN fuel quality standards. By focusing on biodiesel properties and sustainable feedstock utilization, this review proposes strategies to mitigate challenges related to feedstock variability, industrial scalability, and life cycle environmental performance, thereby contributing to the advancement of biodiesel's role in the global renewable energy portfolio.
