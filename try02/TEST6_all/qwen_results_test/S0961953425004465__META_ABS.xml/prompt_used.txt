You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ferric chloride-driven microwave-assisted hydrothermal pretreatment for boosting macroalgal sugar recovery and solubilization This study examines the catalytic hydrothermal solubilization of macroalgae using FeCl3 under microwave-assisted heating to optimize total reducing sugars (TRS) yield and solubilization efficiency. A Box-Behnken design evaluates FeCl3 concentration (0.05–0.15 M), temperature (50–150 °C), and reaction time (5–25 min) on biomass conversion. Higher FeCl3 concentration (0.05 M–0.15 M) further enhances TRS yield to 354 mg·g−1 and solubilization to 44.11%, likely due to Fe3+ catalyzing cellulose and hemicellulose depolymerization. Reaction time has the least effect compared to temperature and FeCl3 concentration. The RSM shows while an increase in reaction time contributes to a higher TRS yield, its influence on solubilization remains relatively minor. RSM shows high predictability (R2 = 0.9968 for TRS, 0.9940 for solubilization). Optimal conditions (0.15 M FeCl3, 98 °C, 25 min) yield 190.11 mg·g−1 TRS and 43.16% solubilization with minimal byproducts. Thermal analysis (TG-FTIR) reveals that pretreatment shifts biomass decomposition from 900 °C (raw) to 625 °C (0.15 M FeCl3), indicating enhanced breakdown. SEM images show increased porosity, roughness, and fractures, improving hydrolysis. Py-GC/MS analysis identifies high-value pyrolysis products such as benzene, toluene, phenol, styrene, and naphthalene. Overall, FeCl3-catalyzed microwave-assisted hydrothermal pretreatment significantly enhances sugar recovery and biomass solubilization, demonstrating its potential for bioethanol production and value-added chemical synthesis.
