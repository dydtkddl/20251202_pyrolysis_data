Ferric chloride-driven microwave-assisted hydrothermal pretreatment for boosting macroalgal sugar recovery and solubilization This study examines the catalytic hydrothermal solubilization of macroalgae using FeCl3 under microwave-assisted heating to optimize total reducing sugars (TRS) yield and solubilization efficiency. A Box-Behnken design evaluates FeCl3 concentration (0.05–0.15 M), temperature (50–150 °C), and reaction time (5–25 min) on biomass conversion. Higher FeCl3 concentration (0.05 M–0.15 M) further enhances TRS yield to 354 mg·g−1 and solubilization to 44.11%, likely due to Fe3+ catalyzing cellulose and hemicellulose depolymerization. Reaction time has the least effect compared to temperature and FeCl3 concentration. The RSM shows while an increase in reaction time contributes to a higher TRS yield, its influence on solubilization remains relatively minor. RSM shows high predictability (R2 = 0.9968 for TRS, 0.9940 for solubilization). Optimal conditions (0.15 M FeCl3, 98 °C, 25 min) yield 190.11 mg·g−1 TRS and 43.16% solubilization with minimal byproducts. Thermal analysis (TG-FTIR) reveals that pretreatment shifts biomass decomposition from 900 °C (raw) to 625 °C (0.15 M FeCl3), indicating enhanced breakdown. SEM images show increased porosity, roughness, and fractures, improving hydrolysis. Py-GC/MS analysis identifies high-value pyrolysis products such as benzene, toluene, phenol, styrene, and naphthalene. Overall, FeCl3-catalyzed microwave-assisted hydrothermal pretreatment significantly enhances sugar recovery and biomass solubilization, demonstrating its potential for bioethanol production and value-added chemical synthesis.
