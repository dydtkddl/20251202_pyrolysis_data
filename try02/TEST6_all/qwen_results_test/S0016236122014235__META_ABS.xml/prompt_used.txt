You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Food waste pyrolysis by traditional heating and microwave heating: A review Food waste has extensive sources and can be produced in every stage of the supply chain. Traditional landfills and incineration of food waste are deteriorating our environment. As a greener technique, pyrolysis has attracted increased interest because it provides a promising way to convert billion tons of food waste into value-added products. The main pyrolysis methods can be divided into traditional heating and microwave heating. Their distinct heating mechanism can significantly affect the pyrolysis process. Based on this, this paper summarized and overviewed the heating mechanism and effect factors of both traditional heating and microwave heating pyrolysis. Moreover, the latest studies of food waste pyrolysis in traditional and microwave heating are also reviewed from biochar, bio-oil, and biogas. This paper aims to review the effects of heating methods on food waste pyrolysis products and yield distributions, which can be of great importance to the pyrolysis application and further investigation. Moreover, the techno-economic analysis is also involved in this review to provide a reference for pyrolysis industrialization. Lastly, this paper discussed the existing challenges and future implications for the future development of food waste pyrolysis, where the pretreatment needs more optimization and studying.
