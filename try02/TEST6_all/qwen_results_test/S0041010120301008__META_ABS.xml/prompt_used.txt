You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Occurrence, quantification, and adsorptive removal of nodularin in seawater, wastewater and river water The presence of potent hepatotoxic cyanotoxins such as nodularin (NOD) in drinking water, groundwater, surface water, seawater and recreational waters presents a major risks to human and environmental health. Human exposure to cyanotoxins could lead to various health effects such as liver damage, jaundice, neurotoxicity and gastroenteritis. Therefore, it is critical to investigate their occurrence in environmental matrices. This study reports the use of tyre-based activated carbon (WTAC) as an adsorbent for preconcentration and removal of nodularin from environmental matrices prior to high performance liquid chromatographic analysis. The preconcentration and adsorption experiments were carried out in presence of other environmental components to consider the external effect on WTAC adsorption of nodularin. Under optimum conditions, the linear dynamic range was 0.05–70 μg L− 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9991. The LOD and LOQ (n = 10) in the absence and in the presence of humic acids were 0.012–0.025 μg L− 1 and 0.040–0.083, n = 10), respectively. The repeatability (n = 10) and reproducibility (n = 5) of the method expressed as relative standard deviation (%RSD) were 3.7 and 5.1%, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of WTAC was 345 μg g −1. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the presence of humic acid has an effect on the nodularin adsorption to WTAC. However, high concentrations other coexisting ions such a Cl−, NO3 −, PO4 3−, HCO3 −, SO4 2− had no significant the effect on the adsorption process. The proposed technique was then used for a preconcentration and elimination of NOD trace levels in different water matrices. The results showed that the WTAC was an effective adsorbent for the preconcentration and removal of NOD from the complex matrices.
