You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coupled effects of Fenton-like systems with different concentrations of H2O2/Biochar on diethyl phthalate removal: Dominant role of environmental persistent free radicals (EPFRs) To investigate the impact of different H2O2 concentrations on the Fenton-like systems of H2O2/biochar, this study examined the mechanism of the physical structure and environmental persistent free radicals (EPFRs) of biochar during diethyl phthalate (DEP) removal by the Fenton-like system. The peak-splitting method was utilized to differentiate EPFRs types in cotton stalk biochar produced at different temperatures. High-temperature environments promote π-electron delocalization, which facilitates phenyl π free radicals and σ-π oxygen-containing free radicals. By analyzing relationships between the removal rate K1 and removal constant Kobs of DEP with the structural properties of biochar, it was discovered that EPFRs concentrations in biochar had a significant positive correlation with K1 (r = 0.92) and Kobs (r = 0.97). Different H2O2 concentrations added to the biochar removal system resulted in varied DEP removal efficiency. Among them, CS500, CS550, and CS600 exhibited superior DEP removal efficiency when H2O2 concentration was 5 mM.
