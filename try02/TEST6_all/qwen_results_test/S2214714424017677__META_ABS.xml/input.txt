MFe2O4/biochar composites in persulfate-advanced oxidation process for antibiotic treatment: A mini review The “1+1 > 2” effect in metal-based biochar composites for persulfate-advanced oxidation processes (PS-AOPs) is a result of the synergistic interplay between the catalytic activity of metal component and the adsorptive properties of biochar, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment. In this review, we summarizes recent advancements in the synthesizing spinel ferrite modified biochar composites and their application in treating antibiotic wastewater through PS-AOPs, with a particular focus on elucidating the mechanism by which spinel ferrite modified biochar composites active PMS/PDS. Finally, this review presents an overview of the current applications and future prospects for utilization of spinel ferrite modified biochar composites in PS-AOPs. It is projected that this review will serve as a valuable reference for designing and synthesizing composite catalysts.
