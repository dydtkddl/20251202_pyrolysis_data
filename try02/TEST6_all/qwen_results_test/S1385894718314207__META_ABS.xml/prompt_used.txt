You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dimethyl ether to hydrocarbons over ZSM-5: Kinetic study in an external recycle reactor DME provides advantages in the valorization of feed streams of low H2/CO ratio, which are formed from feedstocks such as biomass or coal. It is currently accepted that the conversion of oxygenates, such as DME or methanol, to hydrocarbons proceeds via the dual-cycle mechanism. After inspection of several kinetic models developed for the methanol-to-gasoline (MtG) reaction, we show in this investigation that they have limited applicability when dimethyl ether (DME) is used as feedstock. Therefore, the development of a kinetic model able to represent the DME-to-hydrocarbons (DtH) over a ZSM-5 catalyst was necessary. In this research, we have developed a new kinetic model that considers main steps of the dual cycle mechanism, including: (i) formation of aromatic intermediates (polymethylbenzenes); (ii) dealkylation of the intermediates to produce ethylene and propylene; (iii) methylation of small olefins to increase the chain size of the hydrocarbons; (iv) hydrogenation of ethylene, propylene and butenes to produce the corresponding saturated compounds; and (v) dimerization reactions between propylene and butenes to produce higher hydrocarbons. Moreover, the kinetic parameters of this new model were estimated from regression analysis using kinetic data measured under gradientless conditions in a fixed-bed external recycle reactor over a wide range of conditions, with temperatures from 325 to 375 °C, weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) from 25 to 125 h−1, a total pressure of 1 bar and undiluted DME as feed. The newly developed model allowed a good description of the experimental results, showed better performance than models available in literature for the MtG reaction, and rendered kinetic parameters that met physicochemical and statistical constraints, showing good agreement with results from DFT calculations reported by other authors.
