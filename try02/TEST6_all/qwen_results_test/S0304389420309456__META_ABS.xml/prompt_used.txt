You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Probing the aging processes and mechanisms of microplastic under simulated multiple actions generated by discharge plasma Microplastics (MPs) are becoming one class of pollutants with high global concerns. Information regarding aging behaviors of MPs in complicated natural conditions is still lacking due to the very slow aging processes. In this study, discharge plasma oxidation was applied to simulate the various radical oxidation and physical effects naturally occurring in the environment to shed light on the aging behaviors and mechanisms of MPs, with polyvinyl chloride microplastic (PVC-MP) as a model. The surface morphology, particle size, specific surface area, crystallinity, and chemical compositions of PVC-MP were comprehensively characterized as a result of aging. The aging degree indicated by carbonyl index and oxygen-to-carbon ratio increased with the plasma oxidation intensity and duration. The aged PVC-MP was characterized as more O-containing functional groups, smaller particle size, larger specific surface area, higher hydrophilicity, and higher crystallinity. Consequently, the aged PVC-MP provided more sites for adsorption of tetrabromobisphenol (TBBPA) in solutions by forming hydrogen-bonds, and electrostatic force. The changes in the properties of the aged PVC-MP, and the strong adsorption with TBBPA led to unexpected synergistic toxic effects to Scenedesmus obliquus. The results provide direct evidences of aging processes of MPs and the potential environmental risks due to aging in the environment.
