You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable energy cycles based on liquid oxygenates as carbon-neutral hydrogen carriers: A holistic vision Simple energy-dense liquid oxygenates obtained directly from biomass e.g., fermentation ethanol, or “solar methanol”, synthesised from renewable hydrogen (via PV-driven water electrolysis) and recycled carbon dioxide, could provide the basis of an energy cycle that is climate-neutral and promotes long-term sustainability in industrial chemical processing. The development of new earth-abundant heterogeneous (photo-)catalysts and associated reaction engineering promoting hydrogen release (by steam-reforming) and insertion (by CO2 hydro-deoxygenation) under mild conditions will be pivotal to its success. This review anticipates the key methodologies involved in future bio-refineries and forecasts the increasing role therein of modular and portable low-power solar concentrators as renewable (photonic and thermal) resources. The techno-economic prospects for oxygenates like acetaldehyde, ethylene glycol, and glycerol, are also considered based on their reactivity (C2) and/or a pre-existent supply glut in need of valorisation (C3). Many examples highlighting the growing importance of computational (DFT and microkinetic) modelling in catalyst development are presented.
