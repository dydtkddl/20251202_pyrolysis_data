You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hierarchically porous MgO/biochar composites for efficient CO2 capture: Structure, performance and mechanism For enhancing the CO2 uptake performance of MgO-based materials, hierarchically porous MgO/biochar composites were prepared using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The CO2 adsorption properties was investigated in detail and the adsorption mechanism was revealed by considering structure − function relationships and performing density functional theory calculations. The MgO/biochar-1 had hierarchical pore structure and high specific surface area (1453 m2·g−1) with abundant narrow micropores (<1.0 nm), facilitating the adsorption of CO2. The results demonstrated that MgO/biochar-1 exhibited the highest CO2 capture capacity of 6.65 mol⋅kg−1 (273 K, 1 bar) and excellent selectivity for CO2/N2 (96.70 at CO2/N2 = 15:85, v/v). After 3 cycles, the adsorption capacity of MgO/biochar-1 still remained at 5.70 mol⋅kg−1 (273 K, 1 bar), suggesting the well cycling performance. The results of density functional theory calculation indicated that the oxygen-containing functional groups and MgO particles substantially enhanced the CO2 capture performance due to the enhanced interactions between MgO/biochar and CO2. This study provides novel insights for the construction of efficient and cheap solid adsorbents for CO2 capture.
