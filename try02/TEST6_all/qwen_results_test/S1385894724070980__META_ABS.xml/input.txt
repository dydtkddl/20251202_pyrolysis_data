Hierarchically porous MgO/biochar composites for efficient CO2 capture: Structure, performance and mechanism For enhancing the CO2 uptake performance of MgO-based materials, hierarchically porous MgO/biochar composites were prepared using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The CO2 adsorption properties was investigated in detail and the adsorption mechanism was revealed by considering structure − function relationships and performing density functional theory calculations. The MgO/biochar-1 had hierarchical pore structure and high specific surface area (1453 m2·g−1) with abundant narrow micropores (<1.0 nm), facilitating the adsorption of CO2. The results demonstrated that MgO/biochar-1 exhibited the highest CO2 capture capacity of 6.65 mol⋅kg−1 (273 K, 1 bar) and excellent selectivity for CO2/N2 (96.70 at CO2/N2 = 15:85, v/v). After 3 cycles, the adsorption capacity of MgO/biochar-1 still remained at 5.70 mol⋅kg−1 (273 K, 1 bar), suggesting the well cycling performance. The results of density functional theory calculation indicated that the oxygen-containing functional groups and MgO particles substantially enhanced the CO2 capture performance due to the enhanced interactions between MgO/biochar and CO2. This study provides novel insights for the construction of efficient and cheap solid adsorbents for CO2 capture.
