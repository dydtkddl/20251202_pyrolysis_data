You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Achieving high strength and pseudo-ductility in Bf/Cu composite enabled by 3D-Gr@B4C interface-modified layer Improving wettability, interfacial mechanical and thermal compatibility between reinforced boron fiber and Cu are strongly desirable for developing continuous boron fiber reinforced Cu matrix (Bf/Cu) composite, which shows great potential for application in nuclear fusion reactor as a promising high-strength heat-sink material. Herein, a three-dimensional graphene network hybrid B4C (3D-Gr@B4C) coating was fabricated on B fiber by single filament chemical vapor deposition as the interface-modified layer of Bf/Cu composite. It is revealed that the 3D-Gr in 3D-Gr@B4C interface-modified layer can not only supply diffusion channel to Cu for enhancing interfacial thickness and strength, but also serve as high-thermal-conductivity network to increase TC of Bf/Cu composite from 322.3 W/m·K to 343.9 W/m·K. Meanwhile, modulus of 3D-Gr@B4C interface-modified layer lying between Cu and B can also improve the interfacial mechanical compatibility of composite. Accordingly, interface modification on B fiber using 3D-Gr@B4C layer enables tensile strength up to 1016 MPa at RT and 620 MPa at 300 °C, which are ∼1.3 and ∼1.5 times higher than the corresponding values of Bf/Cu composite, respectively. Furthermore, introducing 3D-Gr@B4C layer inhibits abrupt failure of Bf/Cu composite at small tensile strain and opens up fiber pull-outs and shearing of Cu matrix at large tensile strain, producing pseudo-ductile fracture.
