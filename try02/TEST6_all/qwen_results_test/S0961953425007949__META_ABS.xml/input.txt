Integrating dry leaf combustion with palm empty fruit bunch pyrolysis for biochar production and energy recovery: An Aspen Plus model This study presents a simulation-based design of a continuous pyrolysis system for converting palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) into biochar, using dry leaves as a renewable heat source. Modeled in Aspen Plus, the system incorporates customized yield prediction models, RYield reactors, and an integrated Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for energy recovery. The model was validated against experimental data (R2: 94.9 %), and simulation results show that pyrolysis temperature significantly affects product distribution, with bio-oil yield peaking at ∼400 °C. The system achieves an energy efficiency of 67.94 %, with an estimated annual CO2-equivalent avoidance of ∼1.08 tons per unit. This approach demonstrates the potential of decentralized biomass systems for rural energy generation and carbon sequestration. Future work will focus on optimizing thermal efficiency through enhanced ORC integration.
