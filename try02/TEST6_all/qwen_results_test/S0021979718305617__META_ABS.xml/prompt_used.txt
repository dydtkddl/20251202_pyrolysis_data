You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reduced graphene oxide decorated with carbon nanopolyhedrons as an efficient and lightweight microwave absorber Graphene-based composites are becoming a new kind of microwave absorbers that can overcome the challenges related to the performance and light weight in electromagnetic pollution precaution. Herein, a series of reduced graphene oxide decorated with carbon nanopolyhedrons (CNPs/rGO) composites have been successfully fabricated through in situ pyrolysis of ZIF-8/GO hybrids. It is found that GO can restrain the growth of ZIF-8 crystals and produce small-size CNPs after high-temperature pyrolysis, and CNPs will suppress the re-stacking of rGO nanosheets. More importantly, the coupling of CNPs and rGO not only generates the desirable synergistic effects, but also accounts for the profitable interfacial polarization. Therefore, the electromagnetic parameters and microwave absorption properties of these composites can be rationally modulated in terms of the amount of GO. The optimized CNPs/rGO composite exhibits strong reflection loss [−66.2 dB (6.2 GHz, 2.89 mm)] and broad qualified bandwidth (over −10 dB in 3.2–18.0 GHz with integrated absorber thickness of 1.0–5.0 mm), which are superior to many graphene-based composites with high-density magnetic components. Electromagnetic analysis reveals that good attenuation ability and impedance matching are responsible for its excellent performance. It is believed that these results may inspire the design of lightweight microwave absorbers in the future.
