You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal annealing of coal at high temperature and high pressure. Effects on fragmentation and on rate of combustion, gasification and oxy-combustion The present paper addresses thermal annealing of coal under the combined effects of temperature and pressure. Coal particles were pyrolysed in a pressurized heated grid reactor with heating rate of 5000°C/s up to 1600°C. The pressure during heat treatment was set to values in the range 1–12bar. After heat treatment char samples were collected and subjected to: 1. Isothermal and non isothermal thermogravimetric analysis, in order to measure their reactivity towards oxygen, carbon dioxide and mixtures of oxygen–carbon dioxide. 2. XRD and porosimetric analysis in order to investigate their structure. 3. Laser light scattering particle analysis in order to assess the extent of fragmentation experienced during heat treatment. Results show that upon heat treatment coal particles undergo severe thermal annealing and extensive fragmentation. For a given temperature of heat treatment, the effect of pressure of char preparation turns out to be non monotonous: at 1500°C both char porosity and reactivity pass through a minimum at pressure in the order of 2–5bar. The probability of fragmentation and the degree of graphitization follow a specular trend, with a maximum at pressures of 2–5bar.
