Catalytic microwave conversion of LDPE–PET waste: Unravelling the influence of process parameters Catalytic Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (CMAP) is emerging as a highly efficient and sustainable thermochemical strategy for valorising plastic waste into high-value fuels and chemicals, addressing critical environmental burdens. This study investigates the CMAP of a binary thermoplastic blend comprising low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in a 1:1 (wt./wt.) ratio under variable process parameters: microwave power (270, 450, 630 W), susceptor dosage (5, 10, 15 g activated carbon), and catalyst loading (5, 10, 15 g zeolite). Product yields were 30–45 wt% for pyrolytic oils, 20–35 wt% for permanent gases, and 25–40 wt% for char. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of liquid products identified dominant C–H stretching, carbonyl (CO), and aromatic CC bands, indicative of complex aliphatic, oxygenated, and aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks. GC–MS profiling revealed power-dependent chemical distributions: aliphatic hydrocarbons (30–50 wt%) dominated at 270 W, mono- and polyaromatics (25–35 wt%) were prevalent at 450 W, while oxygenated species including furans and cyclopentenones (15–25 wt%) increased at 630 W. Phenolic derivatives were also identified across conditions. Carbon number distribution spanned C7–C25, with a peak in the C10–C15 fraction at 450 W, consistent with intensified chain scission and secondary cracking. Higher power promoted formation of lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (C7–C10), indicating enhanced thermal decomposition.
