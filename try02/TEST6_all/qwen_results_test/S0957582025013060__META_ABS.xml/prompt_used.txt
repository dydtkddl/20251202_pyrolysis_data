You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic microwave conversion of LDPE–PET waste: Unravelling the influence of process parameters Catalytic Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (CMAP) is emerging as a highly efficient and sustainable thermochemical strategy for valorising plastic waste into high-value fuels and chemicals, addressing critical environmental burdens. This study investigates the CMAP of a binary thermoplastic blend comprising low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in a 1:1 (wt./wt.) ratio under variable process parameters: microwave power (270, 450, 630 W), susceptor dosage (5, 10, 15 g activated carbon), and catalyst loading (5, 10, 15 g zeolite). Product yields were 30–45 wt% for pyrolytic oils, 20–35 wt% for permanent gases, and 25–40 wt% for char. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of liquid products identified dominant C–H stretching, carbonyl (CO), and aromatic CC bands, indicative of complex aliphatic, oxygenated, and aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks. GC–MS profiling revealed power-dependent chemical distributions: aliphatic hydrocarbons (30–50 wt%) dominated at 270 W, mono- and polyaromatics (25–35 wt%) were prevalent at 450 W, while oxygenated species including furans and cyclopentenones (15–25 wt%) increased at 630 W. Phenolic derivatives were also identified across conditions. Carbon number distribution spanned C7–C25, with a peak in the C10–C15 fraction at 450 W, consistent with intensified chain scission and secondary cracking. Higher power promoted formation of lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (C7–C10), indicating enhanced thermal decomposition.
