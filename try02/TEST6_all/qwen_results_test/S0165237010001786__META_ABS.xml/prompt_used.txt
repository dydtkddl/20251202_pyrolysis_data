You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of oak via pyroprobe and bench scale, packed bed pyrolysis reactors The pyrolytic conversion of oak sawdust at 500°C in flowing He over eight proprietary catalysts is described and compared to the control bed material, quartz sand. The reactions were conducted and compared in two reactors, an analytical, μg-scale pyroprobe reactor and a bench, g-scale packed bed reactor. The catalysts examined were modified acid catalysts, dealuminated-zeolite Y, β-zeolite, a naturally occurring metal hydroxide containing mineral, mordenite, and a mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieve. The packed bed reactor allowed the collection of three bulk product fractions, char, liquid, and gas, all of which could not be obtained from the μg-scale pyroprobe reactions. The catalysts effect on the mass balance of the bulk fractions tended toward more chars and less liquid compared to the sand control. The catalysts’ effects on the liquid products obtained in both reactors shifted away from acetic acid, furfural and higher molecular weight phenolics obtained with sand to lower molecular weight aromatics. This halved the total acid number of the liquid fraction and raised the pH by up to 1.4 units. The modified catalysts’ effects on the gas products from both reactors did not follow a specific trend. Instead, specific catalysts were able to enrich specific gas species up to a factor of 15 while suppressing the formation of others compared to the sand control. Two catalysts, β-zeolite and a naturally occurring metal hydroxide containing mineral, were regenerated and recycled up to five times with no loss of activity.
