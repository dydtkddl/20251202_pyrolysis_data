You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon-based materials derived from green and sustainable chemistry: Current perspectives for electrocatalysis and energy applications Green and sustainable chemistry is pivotal in tackling the growing global demand for clean energy and environmental sustainability. This review focuses on carbon-based materials, derived from renewable or waste biomass resources, as emerging, eco-friendly alternatives in electrocatalysis and energy storage applications. These materials possess inherent advantages such as high surface area, superior electrical conductivity, structural tunability, and chemical stability, making them suitable candidates for key reactions including the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Methodologically, we explore green synthesis approaches—such as hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis, and low-energy chemical treatments—that align with sustainable practices by minimizing hazardous reagents and energy consumption. We further analyze recent advances in heteroatom doping (e.g., N, S, P) and hierarchical structural engineering, which enhance catalytic performance by tuning electronic properties and improving ion/mass transport pathways. Our findings underscore that porous carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots significantly boost the efficiency of fuel cells, supercapacitors, and rechargeable batteries. However, challenges persist in terms of scalability, reproducibility, and understanding the complex structure–activity relationships. To address these limitations, we recommend a concerted interdisciplinary approach involving materials science, surface chemistry, and process engineering. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized synthesis protocols, real-time performance monitoring, and closed-loop recycling strategies. By consolidating current knowledge and identifying strategic opportunities, this review aims to guide the rational design of next-generation carbon materials, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies.
