You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of pyrolysis atmosphere and temperature co-regulation on the sorption of tetracycline onto biochar: structure-performance relationship variation Presently, as the prevalent pyrolysis atmospheres, N2 is widely used, while air-limitation and CO2 are rarely considered, to produce biochar to adsorb tetracycline. This study thus used N2, CO2, and air-limitation to produce various biochars at 300 ∼ 750 °C, and explored their structure-performance relationship for tetracycline sorption. The maximum sorption capacities of biochars produced in CO2 and air-limitation were 55.36 mg/g and 71.11 mg/g (at 750 °C), respectively, being 2.34 and 3.01 times that of biochars produced in N2 (23.60 mg/g at 750 °C). Interestingly, except for high pore volume and specific surface area supported pore filling and sites providing effect, ash (containing metal cations, P-O, and S=O) induced complexing effect was the primary mechanism for tetracycline sorption, rather than hydrophobic effect, π-π interaction, and hydrogen bond caused by C composition. This study provides important information about adjusting the pyrolysis atmosphere to improve the sorption performance of biochar toward tetracycline.
