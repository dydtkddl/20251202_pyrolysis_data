You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A sustainable approach for material and metal recovery from E-waste using subcritical to supercritical methanol The heterogeneous nature of e-waste, which is a rich source of metals, polymers, glass fibres and ceramics, is troublesome. Multi-step processes are employed to effectively treat e-waste with minimum environmental impact. In this research, a subcritical to supercritical methanol environment was investigated to pre-treat e-waste, recovering non-metallic fractions and eventually concentrate metals from e-waste. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 150 °C to 300 °C at an autogenous pressure with initial atmospheric pressure. The mechanism of depolymerization was investigated by varying reaction time from 30 min to 240 min; solid to liquid ratio of 1:10 to 1:30 g/ml in a batch reactor under N2 environment. Comparative analysis of liquid products obtained after Supercritical Methanol (SCM) treatment for both Waste Random Access Memory (WRAM) and Waste Printed Circuit Board (WPCB) was done with pyrolyzed oil/liquid product. This research briefly illustrates oil and solid product compositional changes with operating temperature, pressure, and solid/liquid ratio range. The metal concentrations of copper, nickel, silver, zinc, and gold are greater than 90% after SCM treatment. For comparison, the feed material was pyrolyzed under the same condition, the difference in oil and solid products are assessed. In the end section, the environmental and economic benefits of SCM were also discussed compared to other supercritical and conventional technologies. An efficient and greener approach of supercritical solvent is proposed via this research for e-waste recycling.
