You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A state-of-the-art review on waste plastics-derived aviation fuel: Unveiling the heterogeneous catalytic systems and techno-economy feasibility of catalytic pyrolysis In recent years, there has been an increase in the amount of attention paid in published scientific works to the problems that waste plastics, and the associated issues cause in the land and marine ecosystems. Pyrolysis is a promising method for converting waste polymers into useful products such as aviation fuel oil, and the scientific and business communities have been attempting to commercialize it. Much work has been put into the research and development of efficient catalytic pyrolysis systems. There is, however, a significant gap in writing a cutting-edge review on the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to produce aviation fuel oil using the PRISMA technique. The objective of this study is to examine the up-to-date scientific and technological breakthroughs associated with the existing aviation fuel production paths and to identify those that may eventually lead to the construction of a sustainable supply chain fuel. This study focuses on the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to enhance aviation fuel oil production, the factors that affect the enhanced pyrolysis activity, such as process conditions, catalyst, kinetics, and mechanistic insights, as well as the technological feasibility analysis of waste plastic pyrolysis and the proposed setup for commercialization of catalytic plastic pyrolysis. It was discovered that catalytic pyrolysis, temperature, and reactor type could be used to simulate an adequate reactor model to attain the highest possible jet fuel efficiency with zeolites, activated carbon, clays, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and metal-based catalysts. It can be concluded that the alterations of reaction conditions significantly impact the overall selectivity and composition of aviation fuel. The production of aviation fuel is essential for attaining technological and economic objectives, and the current research offers numerous effective ways to transform waste plastics straight into transportation jet fuel.
