You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Eco-friendly design of double-layered coated cotton fabrics for dual-functional flame retardancy and electromagnetic interference shielding With the rapid development of 5G communication technology, it is essential to develop a multifunctional cotton fabric with both flame retardant and electromagnetic shielding properties for cutting-edge electronic communication equipment. In this study, a high-efficiency flame retardant coating was prepared by a simple one-step method using phosphoric acid, sodium alginate (SA) and MXene as raw materials. Due to the phosphorylated sodium alginate (PSA) catalyzing the charring of cotton fabrics and MXene acting as a physical barrier, the coating exhibited excellent flame retardant efficiency against cotton fabrics at an ultra-low addition of about 4.7 wt% (CT-MP-1 achieved a UL-94 rating of V-0 and a limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 24 %). After vertical flammability test of CT-MP-3, the limiting oxygen index was reached 35 %, and the length of combustion damage was reduced from 30 cm to 11 cm compared with pure cotton (CT). Thermogravimetric testing proved that CT-MP-3 reaches 10.15 % of char residue at 800°C. Cone calorimeter test showed that the total heat release (THR) and the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of CT-MP-3 decreased by 39.5 % and 84.6 % compared with CT, respectively. In addition, MXene solution is sprayed on the surface of CT-MP-3 as an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding layer, so that CT-MP-3-m3 can achieve EMI shielding effect (∼ 20 dB). In conclusion, this study lays a foundation for the preparation of EMI shielding cotton fabrics with excellent flame retardant properties, and provides a new method for EMI shielding and flame retardant of electronic communication equipment.
