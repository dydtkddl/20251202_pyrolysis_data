Eco-friendly design of double-layered coated cotton fabrics for dual-functional flame retardancy and electromagnetic interference shielding With the rapid development of 5G communication technology, it is essential to develop a multifunctional cotton fabric with both flame retardant and electromagnetic shielding properties for cutting-edge electronic communication equipment. In this study, a high-efficiency flame retardant coating was prepared by a simple one-step method using phosphoric acid, sodium alginate (SA) and MXene as raw materials. Due to the phosphorylated sodium alginate (PSA) catalyzing the charring of cotton fabrics and MXene acting as a physical barrier, the coating exhibited excellent flame retardant efficiency against cotton fabrics at an ultra-low addition of about 4.7 wt% (CT-MP-1 achieved a UL-94 rating of V-0 and a limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of 24 %). After vertical flammability test of CT-MP-3, the limiting oxygen index was reached 35 %, and the length of combustion damage was reduced from 30 cm to 11 cm compared with pure cotton (CT). Thermogravimetric testing proved that CT-MP-3 reaches 10.15 % of char residue at 800°C. Cone calorimeter test showed that the total heat release (THR) and the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of CT-MP-3 decreased by 39.5 % and 84.6 % compared with CT, respectively. In addition, MXene solution is sprayed on the surface of CT-MP-3 as an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding layer, so that CT-MP-3-m3 can achieve EMI shielding effect (∼ 20 dB). In conclusion, this study lays a foundation for the preparation of EMI shielding cotton fabrics with excellent flame retardant properties, and provides a new method for EMI shielding and flame retardant of electronic communication equipment.
