You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microstructure evolution and enhanced permeation of SiC membranes derived from allylhydridopolycarbosilane The evolution of the physicochemical properties of allylhydridopolycarbosilane (AHPCS) was systematically investigated via DLS, TG, FTIR, XRD, and EDS. AHPCS-derived membranes were prepared by coating AHPCS sols onto porous substrates, which was then followed by pyrolysis at 300–800 °C. The pre-crosslinking by thermal curing significantly increased the colloidal sol size of AHPCS in toluene solutions, which effectively reduced penetration into substrates and enhanced the gas permeation. Furthermore, the pore structure of AHPCS-derived membranes could be precisely tailored by the pyrolysis temperatures, and the results indicated that the structure of membranes could be roughly classified into one of three types: a dense polymer structure, a loose transitional structure, and a denser ceramic structure (here, the term ‘dense/denser’ refers to the small/smaller pore structure, while the ‘loose’ refers to the large pore structure). AHPCS-derived membranes prepared at 300–800 °C under a N2 flow displayed superior H2 permeance of (0.2–5) × 10−6 mol/(m2 s Pa) at 200 °C with good H2/N2 selectivity of 12–56. Ceramic SiC membranes prepared at 700 °C showed an attractive H2 permeance of (2–4) × 10−6 mol (m2 s Pa)−1 at 200 °C with H2/N2 selectivity of 16–22, H2/SF6 selectivity higher than 10,000, and N2/SF6 selectivity higher than 800. Moreover, the structure of the ceramic SiC membranes was highly stable with good oxidation resistance at 500 °C under air. AHPCS membranes prepared at 300–800 °C had different pore structures that exhibited a high level of quality and a variety of permeation properties that could provide many options for membrane materials over a wide range of applications.
