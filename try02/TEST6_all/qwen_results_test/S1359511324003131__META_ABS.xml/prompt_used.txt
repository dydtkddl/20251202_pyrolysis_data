You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover by γ-valerolactone pretreatment and the characteristics of enzymatic residues Efficient pretreatment methods are crucial for the generation of fermentable sugars from the renewable lignocellulose. In this study, γ-valerolactone (GVL), a biomass-derived green solvent, was used to fractionate corn stover (CS). The impact of different additives on the enzymatic hydrolysis and pretreatment of CS within the GVL/water system was carefully investigated. The results demonstrate that the use of H2SO4-assisted GVL/H2O (80:20, w/w) pretreatment at mild conditions successfully facilitates the depolymerization of CS, thereby improving the cellulase accessibility. Furthermore, by increasing the GVL pretreatment temperature to 160 °C with 100 mM H2SO4 addition, the pretreated CS led to nearly 100 % of hydrolysis yield at 2 % (w/v) solid load. Finally, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to evaluate the thermal decomposition characteristics of untreated CS and enzymatic residues based on the H2SO4-assisted GVL/H2O pretreatment. The results indicate that the enzymatic residues had two depolymerization stages from 200 °C to 500 °C with a final residual mass of 22.73 %, which was higher than that of untreated CS (20.56 %). Overall, this study provides an efficient lignocellulose pretreatment for fermentable sugars production and valorization of enzymatic residues.
