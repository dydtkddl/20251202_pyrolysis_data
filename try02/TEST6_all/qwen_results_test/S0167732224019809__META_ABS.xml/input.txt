Pesticides removal and their detection in real samples using green synthesized nanocomposites of biogenic quantum dots and metal oxides: A comprehensive review on recent updates The use of pesticides is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity but they pose significant threats to the environment and human health due to their persistence and toxicity, necessitating effective monitoring and remediation strategies. This review delves into the application of green carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for sensitive pesticide detection and degradation. An analysis of the past decade’s research reveals that sensors based on green CQDs have gained significant traction in pesticide sensing. For CQD-based nanocomposites in pesticide degradation, bismuth oxide-based nanocomposites have been primarily explored, indicating a need for further research with other metal-based nanocomposites. The principal findings demonstrate that CQD-based nanocomposites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity as CQDs act as charge carriers, possess up-conversion photoluminescence properties, and enhance photocatalyst stability. This review comprehensively discusses the synthesis techniques and characteristics of biomass-derived CQDs and assesses their role in fluorescence sensing and photocatalytic degradation in detail. By identifying key challenges and outlining future research directions, this review aims to inspire innovative solutions for mitigating pesticide pollution through the development of sustainable CQD-based technologies.
