You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pesticides removal and their detection in real samples using green synthesized nanocomposites of biogenic quantum dots and metal oxides: A comprehensive review on recent updates The use of pesticides is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity but they pose significant threats to the environment and human health due to their persistence and toxicity, necessitating effective monitoring and remediation strategies. This review delves into the application of green carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for sensitive pesticide detection and degradation. An analysis of the past decade’s research reveals that sensors based on green CQDs have gained significant traction in pesticide sensing. For CQD-based nanocomposites in pesticide degradation, bismuth oxide-based nanocomposites have been primarily explored, indicating a need for further research with other metal-based nanocomposites. The principal findings demonstrate that CQD-based nanocomposites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity as CQDs act as charge carriers, possess up-conversion photoluminescence properties, and enhance photocatalyst stability. This review comprehensively discusses the synthesis techniques and characteristics of biomass-derived CQDs and assesses their role in fluorescence sensing and photocatalytic degradation in detail. By identifying key challenges and outlining future research directions, this review aims to inspire innovative solutions for mitigating pesticide pollution through the development of sustainable CQD-based technologies.
