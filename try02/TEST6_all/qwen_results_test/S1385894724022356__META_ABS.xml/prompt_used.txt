You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient thermal decomposition of AP through intimately encapsulating in 3DOM CoFe2O4 spinel Designing highly active catalysts and constructing the interface between ammonium perchlorate (AP) and catalysts are effective strategies for achieving efficient thermal decomposition of AP, which is an urgent need for developing AP based composite solid propellants. Herein, we report an impregnation vacuum freeze-drying strategy to encapsulate AP in an independent three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) CoFe2O4 (3D CFO) spinel, resulting in a novel 3D CFO encapsulated AP nanocomposite materials (AP-3DCNCs). The connected pores of 3D CFO provide a model structure for the growth of AP nanocrystals, while the impregnation vacuum freeze-drying strategy ensures the uniform distribution of AP crystals in pores, effectively achieving the size effect of AP nanocrystals (39.88 ∼ 55.50 nm). By adjusting the loading capacity of the AP, the AP-3DCNCs configuration was effectively controlled. The thermal decomposition of AP-3DCNCs is greatly enhanced due to their unique configuration. The high-temperature decomposition temperature is significantly reduced by 180.06–141.78 °C, and the maximum equivalent heat release increased by 2.03 times. It can be foreseen AP-3DCNCs are attractive nanocomposites for the thermal decomposition of AP, and these results provide a convenient strategy for the preparation of transition metal-based composite catalysts with promising applications in the field of solid propellants.
