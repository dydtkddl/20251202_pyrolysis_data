You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation on the poisoning characteristics of methane as impurity in La0.9Ce0.1Ni5 based hydrogen storage and purification system In the present work, poisoning effect of CH4 as gaseous impurities in La0.9Ce0.1Ni5 based “Metal Hydride Hydrogen Purification System (MHHPS)” was investigated by varying the impurity level between 10% and 50% by weight, in the H2 gas mixture and by performing cyclic test with 10% impurity. Prototype reactor with 6 embedded cooling tube (ECT) was fabricated and filled with 1.2 kg of La0.9Ce0.1Ni5 for purification study. The experimentation comprises of three steps i.e. absorption, flushing and desorption of gas mixture. The gas samples from each purification stages were analysed using Gas Chromatograph (GC). The system delivered 99.9995% pure hydrogen for 10–20% impure gas mixture. While, for higher impurity level, the purity level of desorbed hydrogen was in the range of 95.9%–99.6%. According to the cyclic study, the amount of hydrogen absorbed was decreased in the range of 0.6 wt% to 0.9 wt% for 50%–90% hydrogen content. For pure hydrogen, the absorption capacity was 1.2 wt%, for absorption condition of 20 °C and 10 bar. The regeneration of the poisoned “Metal Hydride (MH)” bed was performed in two regeneration cycles. The bed poisoning can be decreased significantly, if the desorption temperature is maintained above 90 °C.
