You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of pore structure and surface characteristics of balsa wood-derived activated carbon on hydrogen production from methane decomposition Carbon-based catalysts are highly promising for hydrogen production via methane cracking due to their low cost, high-temperature stability, and resistance to sulfur poisoning. However, their practical application is hindered by several challenges, including difficulty in identifying active sites, complexity in catalyst preparation, and limited stability. In this study, we investigated the effects of surface functional groups and specific surface area on methane adsorption and decomposition using balsa wood-derived activated carbon. Three distinct activation methods were employed to modify the carbon, resulting in variations in surface area and functional group composition. Experimental results demonstrated that optimizing the specific surface area significantly enhances methane conversion, with potassium hydroxide-treated activated carbon achieving a methane conversion rate of 62 % and a hydrogen yield of 57 %, both 20 % points higher than those of unmodified biochar. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations revealed that surface oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carbonyl groups, play a crucial role in promoting methane decomposition by enhancing adsorption and interactions with the catalyst. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing both surface structure and functional groups of activated carbon to improve catalytic performance in methane cracking.
