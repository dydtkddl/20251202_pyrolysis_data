A novel hybrid model for pyrolysis of polystyrene using the method of moments and low molecular component balances The plastic waste crisis is a major global issue, necessitating the development and optimization of efficient recycling processes like pyrolysis to convert plastics into new products or chemicals. Pyrolysis is an inherently complex radical process that should be understood in order to continuously operate and optimize it on a large scale. Therefore, this work constructs a detailed kinetic model for the pyrolysis of polystyrene, built using 13 reaction families, leading to the formation of monomer, dimers, and trimers for each of the investigated polystyrene materials. Our modeling approach combines two different representations for low and high molecular weight species. Where low molecular weight species are explicitly considered in the model, the high molecular weight species are tracked through the Method of Moments. Our work for the first time bridges the gap between the statistical Method of Moments and full chemistry simulations. The model is combined with comprehensive rate of production and sensitivity analyses. These analyses identify random chain fission, radical recombination, and hydrogen abstraction reactions as the main reactions impacting the kinetics of the overall process and final product distribution. The model is validated against an extensive dataset, obtained from an in-house micropyrolysis unit, spanning a wide range of reaction temperatures and polymer chain length distributions. This effort proves the model’s versatility, its accuracy, and its computational efficiency, making our model an excellent tool not only for understanding the process, but also for streamlining the design of future, efficient industrial processes.
