You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of eggshell as catalyst on the torrefaction of empty fruit bunch Biomass derived energy is considered as a sustainable energy. However, the utilization of biomass as a solid fuel has many challenges such as low energy density, high moisture and volatile matter content. Hence, torrefaction is one of the thermal treatments applied to enhance the fuel properties of biomass. The objective of this research was to investigate the influence of calcium-based catalyst on the torrefaction of empty fruit bunch (EFB). Waste eggshell was utilized as Ca source as it stands to be beneficial in terms of availability and cost. The effect of torrefaction parameters such as temperatures from 200 °C to 300 °C, residence times from 30 min to 90 min, and the catalyst amounts from 0 wt% to 15 wt% were investigated. Among the three process parameters, temperature had the most significant effect on mass and energy yield. However, the effect of residence time and the catalyst loading was relatively insignificant. With the increment in torrefaction temperature, higher heating value (HHV) and carbon content in torrefied biomass increased. After catalytic torrefaction, the torrefied biomass displayed increment on cellulose crystallinity and volatile matter content. Moreover, the surface structure of catalytic torrefied biomass at 300 °C was turned into highly fibrous surface due to degradation of lignin. The results from this study concluded that the eggshell catalyst did not alter the characteristics of solid fuel significantly in torrefaction.
