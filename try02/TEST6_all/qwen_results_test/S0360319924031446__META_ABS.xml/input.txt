Progress in numerical simulations and fundamental characteristics of pulverized coal co-firing with ammonia Coal-fired power plants are still the way of power generation in most countries, but the CO2 generated by coal remains high. Pulverized coal co-firing with ammonia is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which has become a hot topic. This review summarizes the progress on pulverized coal co-firing with ammonia. The effects of ammonia co-firing on the formation and transformation mechanisms of NO x and emission characteristics, as well as the emissions of other pollutants, are analyzed and summarized. This review also focuses on applying the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) sub-models in pulverized coal co-firing with ammonia. CFD is vital in pulverized coal ammonia research because of its speed and low-cost advantages. The sub-models and mechanisms of turbulent flow, heat transfer, combustion, and pollutant generation are summarized to understand better the combustion process of CFD co-combustion of pulverized coal and ammonia. Finally, the influence of pulverized coal mixed with ammonia, the CFD sub-model application, and the areas to be improved are summarized and prospected. Pulverized coal co-firing with ammonia is a feasible method to reduce carbon. This review offers fundamental theoretical support and technical guidance for the subsequent pulverized coal co-firing with ammonia.
