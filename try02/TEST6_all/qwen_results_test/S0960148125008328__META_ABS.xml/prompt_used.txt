You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient conversion of CO2 to CH4 through supercritical water gasification of plastic with calcium looping Calcium looping (CaL) is a promising technology with significant implications for carbon capture. However, the traditional CaL requires a high temperature of 950 °C for CaCO3 decomposition, posing challenges for further development due to stringent temperature conditions. This study leverages the advantages of a hydrogen-rich reaction environment in a supercritical water gasification (SCWG) system to develop a thermodynamic model of a solar-driven SCWG system incorporating CaL. This innovation reduces the high-temperature requirement of traditional CaL by 41 %, lowering it to 560 °C, and simultaneously alleviates the coupling difficulty of solar-driven systems. The system utilises waste carbide slag (CS) to convert waste plastics into combustible CH4 and other industrial products, achieving thermochemical elimination of CO2 into CH4. Results indicate that CH4 production in traditional gasification systems increases with temperature, whereas the inclusion of CaL shows a trend of initial increase followed by a decrease, peaking at 560 °C with a 19.12 % increase compared to systems without CaL. Both energy and exergy efficiencies decline with temperature, while the impact of pressure on gasification performance and system efficiency remains below 10 %. Increasing the plastic-to-water ratio enhances CH4 production and energy and exergy efficiencies but reduces the gas yield per unit of plastic.
