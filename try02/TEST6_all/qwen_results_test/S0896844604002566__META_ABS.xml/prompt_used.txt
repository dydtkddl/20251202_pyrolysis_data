You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation of polymer particles with supercritical fluids: A review Recent developments on particle formation from polymers using supercritical fluids have been reviewed with an emphasis on articles published during 2000–2003. First, a brief description of the basic operating principles of the various particle formation processes is presented. These include the rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS), the gas antisolvent process (GAS), supercritical antisolvent process (SAS) and its various modifications, and the particles from gas-saturated solution (PGSS) processes. An account of the general review articles that have been published in previous years is then provided. The publications that have appeared over the past 4 years have been reviewed under two groupings, one involving the production of particles from pure polymers, and the other involving the production of polymer particles that contain active ingredients, especially those that pertain to pharmaceuticals. The majority of the efforts in the current supercritical particle formation technology is indeed on the production of polymer particles that are of pharmaceutical significance. In each grouping, the publications were further categorized according to the primary role played by the supercritical fluid in the process, namely whether it was used as a solvent, or as an antisolvent, or as a solute. This review is the first comprehensive review specifically focused on the formation of particles from polymers.
