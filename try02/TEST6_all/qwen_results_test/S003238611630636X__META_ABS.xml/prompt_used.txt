You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polypropylene nanocomposites with polymer coated multiwall carbon nanotubes Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT) have been functionalized using nitric acid. The functionalized MWNTs (f-MWNT) form stable dispersions in butanol, while as received nanotubes do not. The f-MWNTs/butanol dispersion was added with polypropylene (PP) or maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-g-PP) in xylene solution to form PP/f-MWNT and MA-g-PP/f-MWNT master batches, respectively. Both PP and MA-g-PP formed coatings on f-MWNTs, where the polymer coating thickness was 4–5 nm. Both PP and MA-g-PP exhibited non-covalently bonded interactions with f-MWNTs, and the evidence of these interactions was obtained using FTIR spectroscopy. The interfacial polymers (PP or MA-g-PP) in the master batches exhibited about 20 °C higher thermal decomposition temperature and greater chemical resistance in xylene than the bulk matrix polymer (PP or MA-g-PP). The PP/f-MWNT and MA-g-PP/f-MWNT master batches, as well as pristine MWNTs (p-MWNT) were melt blended with PP and injection molded nanocomposite samples were prepared from the melt blends. Studies regarding crystallization, rheology, and mechanical behavior all showed distinct differences in the nanocomposites performance when processed with MWNTs via the two master-batch approaches, and from pristine nanotubes. Both master batches resulted in much better MWNT dispersions than was achieved using p-MWNTs. Mechanical properties of the three types of injection molded samples at 0.1 wt% MWNT have been determined and compared.
