Non-food crops derived lignocellulose biorefinery for sustainable production of biomaterials, biochemicals and bioenergy: A review on trends and techniques With advancement in biotechnology and reduction in dependency upon non-renewable refineries, the lignocellulose-based bio-economy has become the part of circular economy. Lignocellulose derived from non-food crops can help to boost the bio-economy when used as a valuable resource in biorefineries for production of various biomaterials, bioenergy and biochemicals for various commercial applications. Non-food crops have always been important in agriculture, supplying fuel, fibre, building materials, and a variety of other valuable resources. This will not only help to stabilise the circular bioeconomy, but it will also help to reduce waste and greenhouse gas pollution. However, there are barriers to using non-food residues in biorefinery in terms of product, innovation, and commercialization. The other major challenge in utilization of plant-based substrate is their complex structure and recalcitrant nature. Thus, advanced biotechnological interventions and policies are required to enhance such biorefineries to produce sustainable bioproducts. This review provides a critical overview on trends and techniques used for the valorisation of non-food crops derived lignocellulose for biomaterials, bioenergy, biochemicals, and other value-added products within the green biorefinery along with critical suggestions on the future potential of non-food crops for environmental sustainability.
