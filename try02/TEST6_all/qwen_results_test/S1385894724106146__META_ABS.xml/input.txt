Selective separation and value-added utilization of non-metallic components from waste mobile phone circuit boards for reinforcing epoxy composites The non-metallic components (NMCs) derived from waste mobile phone printed circuit boards (WMPCBs) are frequently disregarded because of their low economic worth and intricate composition, resulting in resource waste and pollution. In this study, a simple and sustainable method is employed to effectively separate NMCs from WMPCBs by using an ultrasound-enhanced gravity separation technology. Subsequently, a combination process of glutathione leaching, ball milling, and KH-550 modification is conducted to prepare modified-NMCs (m-NMCs) while also effectively removing residual metals from NMCs. The m-NMCs, which have strong dispersibility and compatibility in the epoxy resin (EP) matrix, served as fillers to create m-NMCs/EP composites to improve the performance of EP. Additionally, the mechanical and thermal properties of m-NMCs/EP composites are systematically examined. The results demonstrate that the mechanical and thermal properties of the m-NMCs/EP composites are improved by controlling the contents of m-NMCs. The increments of tensile strength, flexural strength, compressive strength, and hardness for EP composite at the addition of 5 wt% m-NMCs are 51.29 ± 3.92 %, 47.18 ± 2.00 %, 27.86 ± 0.72 %, and 164.59 ± 2.84 %, respectively. Furthermore, the thermal stability and initial curing temperature of composites are also positively affected. The as-prepared NMCs and m-NMCs/EP composites display comparatively weak environmental threats. This study provides a new insight into industrial applications for both separation and value-added utilization of NMCs.
