You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective separation and value-added utilization of non-metallic components from waste mobile phone circuit boards for reinforcing epoxy composites The non-metallic components (NMCs) derived from waste mobile phone printed circuit boards (WMPCBs) are frequently disregarded because of their low economic worth and intricate composition, resulting in resource waste and pollution. In this study, a simple and sustainable method is employed to effectively separate NMCs from WMPCBs by using an ultrasound-enhanced gravity separation technology. Subsequently, a combination process of glutathione leaching, ball milling, and KH-550 modification is conducted to prepare modified-NMCs (m-NMCs) while also effectively removing residual metals from NMCs. The m-NMCs, which have strong dispersibility and compatibility in the epoxy resin (EP) matrix, served as fillers to create m-NMCs/EP composites to improve the performance of EP. Additionally, the mechanical and thermal properties of m-NMCs/EP composites are systematically examined. The results demonstrate that the mechanical and thermal properties of the m-NMCs/EP composites are improved by controlling the contents of m-NMCs. The increments of tensile strength, flexural strength, compressive strength, and hardness for EP composite at the addition of 5 wt% m-NMCs are 51.29 ± 3.92 %, 47.18 ± 2.00 %, 27.86 ± 0.72 %, and 164.59 ± 2.84 %, respectively. Furthermore, the thermal stability and initial curing temperature of composites are also positively affected. The as-prepared NMCs and m-NMCs/EP composites display comparatively weak environmental threats. This study provides a new insight into industrial applications for both separation and value-added utilization of NMCs.
