Thermocatalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste into renewable fuel and value-added chemicals: A review of plastic types, operating parameters and upgradation of pyrolysis oil The depletion of fossil fuels and increasing demand for global energy needs suggest the need to explore alternative green, sustainable, and renewable energy sources. Harnessing plastic waste via the pyrolysis technique is a viable alternative for fuel production. This method addresses concerns about waste plastic disposal while simultaneously producing fuels. Plastic waste fuel is a viable alternative to current petroleum-based fuels due to its heating value (44–45 MJ kg−1), deficient moisture and ash content, and nearly neutral pH. The present review explores the feasibility of converting waste plastic to fuels via pyrolysis, a thermochemical conversion technique. Specifically, the review discusses the different types of pyrolysis, the resulting products, and their characteristics. The pyrolysis operating parameters, such as catalyst type, temperature, residence duration, heating rates, and plastic waste type, along with yields, quality, and applications, are also investigated. The review also assesses the characteristics of pyrolytic oil and possible upgradation techniques. The objective of this article is to provide insights and commercialize pyrolysis technology to render the needs of the fuel and biofuel industries, as well as to assist researchers interested in the thermochemical transformation of feedstock and the creation of a new pyrolyzer.
