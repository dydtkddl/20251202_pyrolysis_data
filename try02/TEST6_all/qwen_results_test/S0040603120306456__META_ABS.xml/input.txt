Thermokinetic parameters evaluation using reaction calorimetry: Application to butyl methacrylate solution radical polymerization This study investigates the possibility to use reaction calorimetry to estimate thermokinetic parameters of an industrial reaction. The synthesis chosen in this study is the radical polymerization of butyl methacrylate in different organic solvents. The kinetic parameters estimation method is based on the comparison of experimental thermal power profiles released during polymerization and measured using a reaction calorimeter RC1-RTCal with calculated power profiles by means of a simplified model. Individual kinetic parameters of the three main steps (initiation, propagation, termination) were estimated using a minimization method based on a genetic algorithm. Contrary to classical methods, in this paper the three kinetic parameters are estimated simultaneously and at high conversion. The measurement of physical properties, average molecular mass, polydispersity index and viscosity, made it possible to understand the effect of the solvents nature on individual kinetic rate constants. Estimated results are in good consistency with those encountered in the literature obtained by classical methods.
