You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dehydrohalogenation during pyrolysis of brominated flame retardant containing high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) mixed with polyvinylchloride (PVC) Dehydrohalogenation during pyrolysis of brominated flame retardant containing polystyrene (brominated high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br)) mixed with polyvinylchloride (PVC) was carried out in a laboratory scale batch process. Thermal and catalytic degradation of HIPS-Br mixed with PVC on carbon composite of iron oxide (TR-00301) catalyst was investigated. The thermal degradation of waste plastics (HIPS-Br/PVC) yielded liquid products with 55,000ppm bromine and 4300ppm chlorine content in oil. Catalytic degradation (4g; TR-00301) of HIPS-Br/PVC waste plastics at 430°C produced halogen-free clean oil, which can be used as a fuel oil or chemical feedstock. The main liquid products during catalytic degradation were benzene, toluene, styrene, ethyl benzene, α-methyl styrene, butyl benzene, 1,2-dimethyl benzene etc. The average carbon number of the liquid products produced during catalytic degradation (9.3) of waste plastics was less than that of the thermal degradation (10.4) and the density of liquid products was found to be lower during the catalytic degradation than the thermal degradation. The possibility of a single step catalytic process for the conversion of halogenated waste plastics into fuel oil with the simultaneous removal of chlorine and bromine content from the oil was demonstrated.
