You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of anthraquinone and biochar on anaerobic ammonia oxidation system initiation and functional microorganism enrichment This study explored the effects of anthraquinone concentration gradients (0.025–0.075 mmol/L) in combination with biochar (10 g/L) on the initiation of an anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) system and the dynamics of associated functional microorganisms. At the low anthraquinone concentration (0.025 mmol/L), biochar effectively safeguarded core functional bacterial activity by adsorbing toxic substances and providing attachment sites for microorganisms, thereby enhancing NH 4 + -N removal efficiency to 98.6 % and significantly enhancing the system stability. At the medium concentration (0.05 mmol/L), anthraquinone inhibited core functional bacteria, leading to NO 2 ‐ -N accumulation. Biochar maintained nitrogen removal functionality through promoting synergistic metabolism between denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria, achieving 75.4 % of NH 4 + -N removal efficiency. At the high anthraquinone concentration (0.075 mmol/L), the relative abundance of the core functional bacterium Candidatus Brocadia dropped to 1.03 %, leading to the irreversible collapse of the nitrogen removal function. Within the concentration range established in this study, the safe control threshold for anthraquinone was determined to be below 0.05 mmol/L, with biochar's synergistic adsorption effect being effective only under low-to-medium anthraquinone concentrations.
