You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on feasible recycling pathways and technologies of solar photovoltaic modules Given the rapid increase in production and installation of PV systems, recycling of PV modules is becoming more and more important. In this paper, three types of recycling pathways from perspectives of close-loop life cycle, which are manufacturing waste recycling, disposed module remanufacturing and recycling, are investigated. For each pathway, proven technologies are presented and their advantages and drawbacks are described. The results show that recycling technologies for PV manufacturing wastes and end-of-life modules are wildly explored and some are commercially available, although the challenges still remain in process efficiency, reduction in process complexity, energy requirements, and use of chemicals. Some research has been conducted on remanufacturing and reuse of PV modules. The ease-to-disassembly design may improve the reusability of valuable components. It is also found that though studies showed that PV module manufacturing waste recycling and end-of-life module recycling have significant positive impacts on the reducing environment loads, economic viability of PV module recycling is still unfavorable and policies are needed to encourage producer responsibility not only in the PV manufacturing sector but also in the entire energy industry, and an efficient collection network should be important to the economic viability of PV module recycling business.
