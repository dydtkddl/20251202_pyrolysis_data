Exploration of waste-generated nanocomposites as energy-driven systems for various methods of hydrogen production; A review Recently, waste-generated nanomaterials have received a surge in consideration for energy production due to their excellent properties and eco-friendly effects. A plethora of literature has reported on the growing interest for the production of hydrogen (H2) by utilizing sunlight through water splitting and the recycling of bio-waste into organic catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no review on waste-derived nanocomposites for the production of H2. Herein, potential methods, modes of fabrication, and the efficacy of synthesized nanocomposites for H2 production have been highlighted. Distinct attention has been given to waste-generated nanocomposites, including a variety of graphene nanomaterials. Remarkable efforts have been made to fabricate biomass-derived nanomaterials and to optimize their reaction conditions and efficient use in energy production. Finally, future prospects and challenges in improving photocatalytic H2 production are also summarized.
