You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE over H-beta and HZSM-5 zeolites in dynamic conditions Study of the evolution of the process The effect of the addition of a nanocrystalline H-beta zeolite in the pyrolysis of a commercial LDPE has been studied using dynamic conditions in a thermobalance and in a batch reactor, the results have been compared with those obtained using a HZSM-5 zeolite. The H-beta catalyst has an important influence on the decomposition of the polymer even at very low zeolite concentration. Although this mixture has a saturating effect at a certain concentration of catalyst (around 7%), a remarkable effect in the first steps of LDPE decomposition as increasing the catalyst loading has been observed. This important catalytic effect has been attributed to the external acid sites present in the H-beta zeolite. The study of the gaseous products evolved in the catalytic pyrolysis shows the influence of the structure and the temperature on the composition of the gas, and a possible effect of the deactivation of the catalyst. The isobutane/n-butane ratio obtained showed an important variation with temperature and was higher in the gas produced using H-beta than with HZSM-5. This different behaviour can be explained by the different pore structure. A preliminary study of the coke formed with the H-beta zeolite has been carried out and the results show that the zeolite causes an important delay in the oxidation process.
