You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of liquid lead and lead-bismuth eutectic on three alumina forming austenitic (AFA) steels through slow strain rate testing Liquid metal embrittlement (LME) in three newly developed alumina-forming austenitic (AFA) alloys, two 50 kg batches and one 5-ton heat, was studied in the temperature range 350–600 °C in liquid Pb and 140–600 °C in LBE using slow strain rate testing (SSRT) in a low-oxygen environment. No significant decrease in the engineering strain was observed in either environment. However, the presence of secondary cracks along the length of the specimen and brittle intergranular areas on the fracture surfaces indicates that the AFA alloys do show a minor degree of embrittlement above 570 °C. This appears to be related to grain boundary wetting by Pb/LBE. At temperatures below 570 °C, this wetting effect does not seem to be strong enough to induce LME in the alloys, and their ability to form a sufficiently protective oxide means that they remain unaffected by LME. The results indicate that the AFA alloy group can perform sufficiently well in liquid Pb/LBE environments, and long-term testing should be carried out to determine their viability as candidate materials for use in Pb- and LBE-based cooling systems.
