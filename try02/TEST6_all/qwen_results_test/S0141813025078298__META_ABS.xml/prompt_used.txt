You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multifunctional biocarbon/cellulose composites: Synchronizing superior EMI shielding, flame Retardancy and biofertilization via cradle-to-cradle strategy Current shielding technologies predominantly focus on performance optimization while neglecting fire safety considerations especially in construction building. To address the vulnerability of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials to accidental fires, we develop sustainable biocarbon/cellulose composites with integrated EMI shielding and flame-retardant capabilities. This approach employs porous biocarbon particles as functional units combined with three-dimensional cellulose networks through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and physical entanglements. The resulting composite exhibits exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) reaching up to 81.6 dB and superior flame resistance with a limiting oxygen index (LOI) greater than 37 %. Notably, the total heat release and total smoke production of the composite are only 0.4 MJ/m2 and 14 m2, respectively, corresponding to reductions of 97.2 % and 98.7 % compared to traditional plastic sample. Significantly, the biocarbon/cellulose composite also offers substantially lower environmental impacts compared to petroleum-based plastics, with the potential for waste to serve as biofertilizer enhancing plant growth and facilitating carbon sequestration. This cradle-to-cradle paradigm contrasts fundamentally with conventional non-degradable petroleum-based polymers, establishing an environmentally friendly alternative for advanced material applications.
