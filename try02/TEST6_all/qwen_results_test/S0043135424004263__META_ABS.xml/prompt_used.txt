You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Practical strategies of phosphorus reclamation from sewage sludge after different thermal processing: Insights into phosphorus transformation In the context of circular economy and global shortage of phosphorus (P) fertilizer production, it is crucial to effectively recover P during the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge (SS). Although thermal treatment of SS has been widely applied, a targeted P reclamation route is not yet well established. This study has comprehensively investigated and compared the physicochemical properties of SS and solid residues (hydrochar (HC), biochar (BC), sewage sludge ash (SSA), hydrochar ash (HCA), and biochar ash (BCA)) after application of three typical thermal treatment techniques (i.e., hydrothermal carbonization (180‒240 °C), pyrolysis (400‒600 °C) and combustion (850 ℃). P speciation and transformation during thermal processes were extensively explored followed by a rational proposal of effective P reclamation routes. Specifically, thermal processing decomposed organic P and converted non-apatite P to apatite P. Orthophosphate-P was found to be the main species in all samples. Physicochemical properties of the resulting thermal-derived products were significantly affected by the thermal techniques applied, thereby determining their feasibility for different P reclamation purposes. In particular, ash is not recommended for agricultural use due to higher harmful metals content, while acid leaching can be an alternative solution to synthesize non-Fe-containing P products because of the lower co-dissolved Fe content in the leachate. HC and BC offer the option for synthesis of Fe containing products. Eventually, HC and BC demonstrate great potential for agriculture application, however, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted before their real-world applications.
