Recent advancements of hydroxyapatite and polyethylene glycol (PEG) composites for tissue engineering applications – A comprehensive review Tissue engineering is a hastily growing area that attempts to create multifunctional biocompatible biomaterials to regenerate both damaged skin tissues and bone tissues. In these interdisciplinary fields, hydroxyapatite (HAP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based biomaterials create the highest attraction towards regenerative research by easily mimicking and restoring various biological tissues with significant physical properties (provide porous structure, mechanical strength, degradation, swelling, drug release systems) and biological properties (cell adhesion, cell proliferation, tissue granulation). Moreover, tissue engineering has a wide range of applications and influences both soft tissues (muscles, tendons, ligaments, skeletal tissues, and blood vessels) and hard tissues (bones and teeth). The current review provides detailed insights on the preparation and characterization of HAP and PEG-based composites, along with their merits and demerits. We also summarized various applications of HAP and PEG in tissue engineering, such as wound healing, bone application, coating in implants, dentistry, and drug delivery systems. Finally, the enhancement of mechanical and biological properties has been discussed based on recent research articles. The comprehensive review also anticipated the shortcomings and future perspectives of HAP-PEG-based composites to meet the requirements of applications in tissue engineering.
