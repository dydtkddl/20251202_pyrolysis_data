Biochemicals distribution and the collaborative pyrolysis study from three main components of Helianthus annuus stems based on PY-GC/MS In this work, collaborative interaction research under “real native mixture” and lower pyrolysis temperature between Helianthus annuus stems and its three main components were studied using qualitative and quantitative Py-GC/MS. Under the optimized condition (400 °C and 0.2 min), products distribution of hemicellulose were focused on at anterior part of TICs under single components pyrolysis, cellulose on middle and lignin on posterior, while, multicomponent co-pyrolysis has average trend. Finally, principal components analysis (PCA) method was used for exploring similarities or differences in product distribution profiles between the contents of samples. 32 typical biochemicals were classified into five categories broadly, including common, contents increase, decrease or disappeared, uncharged and new products between single components pyrolysis and multicomponent co-pyrolysis. For aromatic biochemical, early separation of biomass to obtain lignin is important for targeted-pyrolysis in industrial application.
