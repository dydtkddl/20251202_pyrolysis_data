You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

MXenes and its composite structures: synthesis, properties, applications, 3D/4D printing, and artificial intelligence; machine learning integration MXenes, a revolutionary class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, have emerged as exceptional materials for advanced composite applications due to their remarkable properties. MXene-based composites exhibit electrical conductivities exceeding 15,000 S/cm, thermal conductivities up to 60 W/m·K, and mechanical strengths surpassing 500 MPa, making them ideal for applications in energy storage, aerospace, and biomedical engineering. This review explores the synthesis of MXene-filled composites via chemical etching, intercalation (enhancing layer spacing by 20–50%), and functionalization (improving compatibility by 70%), and highlights how these processes shape the material’s properties. Applications are discussed, including lithium-ion batteries with capacities exceeding 300 mAh/g and supercapacitors achieving energy densities over 60 Wh/kg. Furthermore, the integration of MXene composites into 3D printing technology enables resolutions as fine as 100 microns, offering unprecedented customization and precision in manufacturing. Machine learning plays a pivotal role in optimizing synthesis protocols, accelerating material discovery by 30–50%, and achieving predictive modeling accuracies above 90%, thereby revolutionizing the design and performance of MXene-based materials. This review will also presents a data-driven perspective on the synthesis, properties, and applications of MXene-filled composites, bridging advanced research and practical innovation to inspire transformative advancements across multiple industries.
