MXenes and its composite structures: synthesis, properties, applications, 3D/4D printing, and artificial intelligence; machine learning integration MXenes, a revolutionary class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, have emerged as exceptional materials for advanced composite applications due to their remarkable properties. MXene-based composites exhibit electrical conductivities exceeding 15,000 S/cm, thermal conductivities up to 60 W/m·K, and mechanical strengths surpassing 500 MPa, making them ideal for applications in energy storage, aerospace, and biomedical engineering. This review explores the synthesis of MXene-filled composites via chemical etching, intercalation (enhancing layer spacing by 20–50%), and functionalization (improving compatibility by 70%), and highlights how these processes shape the material’s properties. Applications are discussed, including lithium-ion batteries with capacities exceeding 300 mAh/g and supercapacitors achieving energy densities over 60 Wh/kg. Furthermore, the integration of MXene composites into 3D printing technology enables resolutions as fine as 100 microns, offering unprecedented customization and precision in manufacturing. Machine learning plays a pivotal role in optimizing synthesis protocols, accelerating material discovery by 30–50%, and achieving predictive modeling accuracies above 90%, thereby revolutionizing the design and performance of MXene-based materials. This review will also presents a data-driven perspective on the synthesis, properties, and applications of MXene-filled composites, bridging advanced research and practical innovation to inspire transformative advancements across multiple industries.
