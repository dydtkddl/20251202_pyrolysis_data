Integrating machine learning predictions of pyrolysis products for improved biomass gasification simulations using the multiphase particle-in-cell method Numerical simulation methods are crucial for studying biomass gasification for hydrogen production, with the optimization of pyrolysis models being key to enhancing prediction accuracy and understanding gasification mechanisms. In this study, the XGBoost-based machine learning (ML) model is developed to predict pyrolysis products based on biomass composition and pyrolysis conditions. The model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of approximately 0.8 for product yields and tar components, and over 0.9 for pyrolysis gas components. The ML model is then integrated into the Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) framework for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a pilot-scale two-stage biomass gasifier. Results show that neglecting tar or using a single-compound tar model leads to prediction errors of 20%–50%. In contrast, the ML-based lumped tar mode reduces the error to around 5%. This work presents a novel application of ML in CFD simulations, providing a promising framework for numerical modeling of biomass gasification.
