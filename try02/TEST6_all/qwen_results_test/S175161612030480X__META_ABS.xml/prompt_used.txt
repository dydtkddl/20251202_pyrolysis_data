You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and characterization of core-shell nanoparticles and their application in dental resins The aim of this study was to synthesize acrylic core-shell particles and silica-loaded core-shell hybrid particles through emulsion polymerization. Also this work examined the influence of synthesized nanoparticles loading in a Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin matrix on some mechanical properties of the dental composite resins. Core-shell particles consisting of polybutyl acrylate (PBA) rubbery core and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/polystyrene (PS) shell were synthesized by seeded emulsion polymerization. For preparing the core-shell hybrid particles, first silica particles with diameters of about 68 nm were synthesized based on the Stöber process. Then the surface of silica particles was treated with ɣ-MPS. Afterwards, polymeric shell was coated on silica nanoparticles through emulsion polymerization. The morphology of core-shell particles was examined by SEM/TEM. Mechanical properties (fracture toughness, flexural strength and flexural modulus) of the photo-cured Bis-GMA/TEGDMA dental resins/composites filled with different mass fractions of synthesized nanoparticles were tested, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the statistical analysis of the acquired data. Formation of glassy shell on PBA core in core-shell particles, grafting of ɣ -MPS onto the silica particles and encapsulation of modified silica by polymeric shell in core-shell hybrid particles were confirmed using various analytical techniques. The results of mechanical tests showed that fracture toughness of Bis-GMA/TEGDMA dental resins improved about 35% by the inclusion of 5 wt% silica-loaded core-shell hybrid particles with little effect on flexural strength. This study shows that incorporation of proper amount of hybrid core-shell particles in dental composites can improve their fracture toughness and thus may extend their service life.
