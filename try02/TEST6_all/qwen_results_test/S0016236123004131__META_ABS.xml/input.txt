Hydrogen-rich syngas production from the lignocellulosic biomass by catalytic gasification: A state of art review on advance technologies, economic challenges, and future prospectus Global population growth, modernization, and industrialization have all significantly increased energy consumption, which has worsened the climate and led to greenhouse gas emissions, forcing researchers to look into eco-friendly, renewable, and sustainable energy sources. Hydrogen (H2) is emerging as one of the cleanest and most carbon-free future energy carriers generated from diverse domestic resources, organic wastes, lignocellulosic biomass, natural gas, and fossil fuels by biochemical and thermochemical routes. Applying thermochemical routes, lignocellulosic biomass for sustainable H2 production have shown great potential for industrial implementation. As a result, the current study emphasizes the state-of-the-art review of developments in gasification technologies, operating circumstances, and catalysts employed for producing H2-rich syngas. Emerging catalytic technologies to improve H2-rich syngas production were discussed in detail. New technologies including, solar gasification, microwave gasification, plasma gasification, and integrated pyrolysis-gasification were also highlighted. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the process are also pointed out in brief to assist future researchers and stakeholders working for its commercialization.
