You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste battery separators with limited removal of the Al2O3 layer for selective aromatic hydrocarbons production over HZSM-5 catalyst Waste battery separators typically feature a "sandwich" structure made of plastic substrates and Al2O3 layers, which are stable and difficult to degrade or recycle. To address this, a novel method was developed for the directional degradation and high-value conversion of waste plastics, combining alkaline pretreatment with catalytic pyrolysis, promoting the efficient and valuable recycling of waste battery separators. Specifically, alkaline washing was applied for the pretreatment of the Al2O3-layered separators to control the limited removal of the Al2O3 layer. Aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) were subsequently produced by pyrolysis using a HZSM-5 catalyst. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for the systematical evaluation of the effects of pretreatment and pyrolysis conditions on AHs production. The findings demonstrated the limited removal of the compact Al2O3 layer through alkaline pretreatment enhanced the synergistic catalytic effect of Al2O3 and HZSM-5. This not only promoted the release of volatile components and their decomposition into more light olefins catalyzed by Al2O3, but also enhanced the subsequent conversion of light olefins into AHs catalyzed by HZSM-5. Optimal conditions included a 0.050 mol/L NaOH concentration, a 650°C-pyrolysis temperature and a catalyst/sample ratio of 12, achieving an AHs yield of 89.89 wt% (on dry ash-free basis). This yield was considerably higher than the 60.40 wt% achieved from untreated separators and the 65.61 wt% from pure polyethylene separators. This study laid a solid foundation for the efficient and high-value recycling of waste battery separators.
