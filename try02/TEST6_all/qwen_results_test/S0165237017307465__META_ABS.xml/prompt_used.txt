You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of beech wood pyrolytic vapors Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of beech wood chips was undertaken in a laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor equipped with a biomass semi-continuous dispenser. During pyrolysis, chars are retained on a quartz frit and the pyrolytic vapors are entrained through a fixed-bed catalyst to be converted. Several acidic catalysts such as zeolites H-Beta, zeolite HMFI and 5% Ni supported on HMFI were screened in this equipment. The Ni/HMFI catalyst was also tested in the presence of 1 vol.% of hydrogen in the feed stream. Mass and carbon balances were carefully checked and the gas, liquids and solids fractions were analyzed in-depth to evaluate the impact of the catalyst compared to thermal conversion. In the presence of a catalyst, with a low catalyst-to-biomass ratio of 0.1, a lower amount of bio-oil was formed but it contained less oxygen. The bio-oils were characterized by bi-dimensional GC (GCxGC) coupled with MS and FID detectors. The amount of gaseous products also increased in the presence of all catalysts. In addition of the deoxygenation, gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) showed a decrease of the highest molecular masses in the bio-oil after catalytic treatment, which confirms the conversion of some oligomers. The presence of Ni enhanced the deoxygenation reactions while the addition of H2 is also beneficial to the bio-oil composition.
