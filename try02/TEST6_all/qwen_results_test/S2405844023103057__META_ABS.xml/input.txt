Synthesis and characterization of polyurethane flexible foams provided from PET derivatives, fly ash, and glass wastes The aim of this study involved the synthesis and characterization of polyurethane (PUR) foams obtained from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) depolymerization products and two types of filling agents, namely fly ash and glass waste. The depolymerized PET-based products were obtained by zinc acetate-catalyzed glycolysis process in diethylene glycol (DEG) as a co-reactant. The resulting glycolysis products were contacted with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, castor oil, and reinforcing agents. The resulting PUR specimens were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), EDX mapping, mechanical tests, and thermal analysis. The analysis confirmed that the best mechanical performances were registered by the specimens with the lowest concentration of filling agent, while the highest thermal resistance was achieved by the PUR foams with the highest concentration of reinforcing agent.
