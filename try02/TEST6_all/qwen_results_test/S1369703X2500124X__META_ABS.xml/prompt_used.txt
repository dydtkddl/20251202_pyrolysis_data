You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Three-dimensional and serum-free culture in fixed-bed bioreactor enhance exosome production by affecting the cytoskeleton through integrin β1 and RAC1 Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles containing a variety of bioactive factors, showing significant potential as cell-free therapeutic agents. However, the large clinical doses required for exosome administration highlight the need for a scalable serum-free production system to increase exosome yield. In this study, human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) were cultured in three-dimensional (3D) environments using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber membranes. Two key pathways promoting exosome secretion and biogenesis through 3D culture were identified. Specifically, 3D culture reduced the expression of Integrin β1, leading to the decondensation of cortical actin, and increased the expression of RAC1, which promoted actin aggregation on the membranes of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Building on this mechanistic understanding, we simulated the depolymerization/aggregation of the cytoskeleton in 3D culture and designed a serum-free medium optimized for exosome production. For large-scale exosome production, hUCMSCs were cultured in a fixed-bed bioreactor using PET fiber rolls as the fixed-bed layer with the developed serum-free medium. This setup increased exosome production per cell by 16-fold compared to 2D culture, yielding 2.6 × 10^14 exosome particles. The exosome products demonstrated enhanced in vitro angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and in vivo wound healing capabilities. This study provides valuable insights and strategic guidance for the serum-free, large-scale production of exosomes using bioreactors, with significant implications for therapeutic applications.
