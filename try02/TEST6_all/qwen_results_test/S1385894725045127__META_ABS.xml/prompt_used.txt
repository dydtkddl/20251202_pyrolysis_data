You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

When low-dimensional nanomaterials meet polymers: A promising configuration for flame retardancy and corrosion protection Nanomaterial advancements have enabled the development of innovative functional coatings across various sectors. To mitigate the risk of catastrophic failures caused by fire hazards and material degradation, the integration of low-dimensional nanomaterials into polymer coatings has emerged as a crucial safety measure. When engineered at the nanoscale, these materials exhibit robust properties that significantly enhance performance in specialized applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of low-dimensional nanomaterials and their role in improving the flame retardancy and corrosion resistance of polymer composites. Key low-dimensional nanomaterials, including nanoparticles (NPs), nanoclusters, quantum dots (QDs), layered double hydroxide (LDH), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphene derivatives (e.g., GO, rGO), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), nanowires and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have demonstrated effectiveness upon reinforcement in polymer matrices by strengthening nanocomposite coatings against fire and deterioration. These nanomaterials enhance structural integrity by increasing thermal stability, enhancing flame resistance and promoting char layer formation during combustion. By forming barrier layers, they prevent the substrate from the infiltration of corrosive agents such as water, oxygen and chlorine. Furthermore, nanomaterials such as silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and titania (TiO2) have also been incorporated into polymers to enhance the protective features. This comprehensive review highlights the current progress of low-dimensional nanomaterials for flame retardation and corrosion protection by demonstrating their underlying mechanisms and multifunctional capabilities in improving the protection and endurance of polymer-based systems.
