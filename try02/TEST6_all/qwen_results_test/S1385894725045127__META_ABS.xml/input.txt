When low-dimensional nanomaterials meet polymers: A promising configuration for flame retardancy and corrosion protection Nanomaterial advancements have enabled the development of innovative functional coatings across various sectors. To mitigate the risk of catastrophic failures caused by fire hazards and material degradation, the integration of low-dimensional nanomaterials into polymer coatings has emerged as a crucial safety measure. When engineered at the nanoscale, these materials exhibit robust properties that significantly enhance performance in specialized applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of low-dimensional nanomaterials and their role in improving the flame retardancy and corrosion resistance of polymer composites. Key low-dimensional nanomaterials, including nanoparticles (NPs), nanoclusters, quantum dots (QDs), layered double hydroxide (LDH), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphene derivatives (e.g., GO, rGO), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), nanowires and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have demonstrated effectiveness upon reinforcement in polymer matrices by strengthening nanocomposite coatings against fire and deterioration. These nanomaterials enhance structural integrity by increasing thermal stability, enhancing flame resistance and promoting char layer formation during combustion. By forming barrier layers, they prevent the substrate from the infiltration of corrosive agents such as water, oxygen and chlorine. Furthermore, nanomaterials such as silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and titania (TiO2) have also been incorporated into polymers to enhance the protective features. This comprehensive review highlights the current progress of low-dimensional nanomaterials for flame retardation and corrosion protection by demonstrating their underlying mechanisms and multifunctional capabilities in improving the protection and endurance of polymer-based systems.
