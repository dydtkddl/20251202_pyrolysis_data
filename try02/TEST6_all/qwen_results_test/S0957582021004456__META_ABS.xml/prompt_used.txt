You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Methane production and toxicity evaluation of petroleum refinery biosludge through optimization of different modes of heat The colossal amount of hydrocarbon-rich sludge generated from effluent treatment plants of petroleum refineries has enormous potential for methane-rich biogas production. The biodegradation of petroleum refinery biosludge (PRB) was compared between undigested residue (UR) and anaerobically acclimated or digested sludge (DS) from an anaerobic reactor at five different inoculum:sludge ratios (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 based on volatile solids content). Upon performing batch anaerobic degradation assay tests, methanogen-rich DS provided a better seeding environment with maximum methane yield being attained at ratio DS:PRB = 0.5. The long hydrolysis phase of the complex hydrocarbon substrate was intended to be improved through the optimization of different modes of heat application (dry heat, pressurized moist heat, agitated open moist heat and microwave irradiation). The best mode was dry heat which when applied at 140 °C for 60 min improved soluble chemical oxygen demand and fatty acids concentration of untreated sludge by 2.28 and 1.3 folds respectively. Dry heat application enhanced methane production by 24.8 % with 48.7 % organic matter removal in presence of DS as inoculum. Morphological and chemical characterization corroborated the fragmentation of aliphatic hydrocarbon bonds through dry heat application. Positive energy recovery (21,826 kJ) from PRB upon dry heat pretreatment evinces its feasibility at a larger scale. The presence of toxic organic pollutants was confirmed by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis and the phytotoxicity assay using V. radiata showed concentration-dependent decrease in seed germination, shoot length, root length and biomass after the digestion process in comparison to control thereby, suggesting a sustainable and promising method to petrochemical industries for utilization and transformation of such toxic hydrocarbon-rich sludge into a renewable energy source.
