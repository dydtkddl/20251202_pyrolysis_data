You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of oil production through ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene with activated carbon This study studied the ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of waste polyethylene (WPE) with activated carbon (AC). It was found that the operating parameters and AC/WPE mass ratio had complex interactions on the WPE-AC catalytic pyrolysis oil and gas yields. A hybrid method of artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA) was used to establish the mathematical expressions of oil and gas yields under different conditions and optimize the conditions to obtain the highest oil yield. The R2 values and the average absolute relative errors between the experimental and the ANN predicted values were 0.9992 and 0.60%, and 0.9830 and 5.01% in the training and the testing tests, respectively. The optimal oil production calculated by ANN-GA was 69.16 wt% under 479 °C, the AC/WPE mass ratio of 1, and 10 mL/min. The experimental oil yield was 69.63 wt% under the optimal parameters, which was close to the predicted value of ANN-GA. The WPE-AC catalytic pyrolysis oils under different conditions were characterized by the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The types of oil's functional groups did not change with different operating parameters and AC/WPE mass ratios. The oils were composed of alkenes, naphthenes, alkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons ranging from C8 to C33. The operating parameters and AC/WPE mass ratio affected the oil fractions to a great extent.
