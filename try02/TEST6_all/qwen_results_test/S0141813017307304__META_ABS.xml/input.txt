Syntrophic association of termite gut bacterial symbionts with bifunctional characteristics of cellulose degrading and polyhydroxyalkanoate producing bacteria The guild between higher termites and their partnership with the diverse community of bacteria and archaea in their gut is a marvel evolutionary achievement. Sustained attempts were made worldwide with a quest for identifying viable important biological macromolecule polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulating bacteria. Termite gut serve as a novel source for bacteria with dual properties like PHA production as well as cellulose degradation. Among 40 isolates cultivated, 32.5% turned positive for PCR based screening of PhaC gene. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that elite PHA producer and cellulose degrader which is phylogenetically affiliated to Bacillus cereus. The PHA production was maximized by employing different carbon and nitrogen sources along with altered pH and temperatures. GC–MS, FTIR and 1HNMR analyses confirmed the presence of PHA and the thermal characterization was performed through TGA and DSC for the termite gut isolate. Our results indicated that the combined integrative approach using isolated strains from termite gut would be preferable choice in producing biomolecules from cellulosic materials.
