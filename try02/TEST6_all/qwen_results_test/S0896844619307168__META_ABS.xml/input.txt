Migration and transformation of nitrogen during hydrothermal liquefaction of penicillin sludge In this study, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was used to dispose the penicillin sludge (PS). The effects of different reaction conditions on the product and the redistribution and transformation pathway of nitrogen were investigated. The results showed that the highest yield of bio-oil was 37.5% when the temperature of HTL was 340 °C and the holding time was 30 min. About 20% of the nitrogen was present in the solid residue obtained by HTL of PS, and the remaining was converted into other phases. The most amino-N in the PS was present in the aqueous phase in the form of Org-N, and the remaining was converted to pyrrole-N, pyridine-N and quaternary-N in the solid residue. The amine-N in the oil phase was also derived from the hydrolysis of the amino nitrogen. As the temperature of the HTL increased, the amine-N formed a heterocycle-n by Diels- Alder reaction.
