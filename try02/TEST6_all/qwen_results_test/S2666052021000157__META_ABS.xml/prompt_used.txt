You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-quality hydrocarbon fuel production from municipal mixed plastic waste using a locally available low-cost catalyst Thermal treatment of plastic waste into fuels has gained substantial prominence in the scientific community, but processing of municipal mixed plastic waste (MMPW) has still challenging issues due to the wide variance in plastic composition, size, decomposition behavior, and thermal behavior. Hence, the current study was aimed to address these problems by converting MMPW into high-quality hydrocarbon fuel and compare its behavior with conventional mixed virgin plastics (MVP) via thermochemical pyrolysis technology. A locally available low-cost catalyst i.e., CAT-1 of 10 wt% was employed to enhance the fuel yield. Yield patterns of the process were investigated to identify the optimum operating conditions and the maximum fuel yields of liquid fuel attained with MMPW, and MVP was 74.8 wt% and 86.1 wt%, respectively. Detailed chemical characterization of the fuel fractions revealed the presence of a wide variety of hydrocarbons disbursement i.e., C9 – C18. Non-condensable gas composition revealed the major percentage of ethane and propene along with a minor percentage of hydrogen. Physical characteristics of produced hydrocarbon fuel were found to be comparable with the conventional petroleum fuels i.e., higher heating value of 42.1 MJ kg−1, kinematic viscosity 2.48 cSt, and carbon residue value of 0.15 wt%, which signifies the application of the produced hydrocarbon fuel in automobiles, stationary engines and industrial heating appliances as a promising fuel candidate.
