Comparison between different mathematical models for the simulation of Industrial Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) units Most of the work dealing with the modelling of industrial fluid catalytic cracking units is based upon a highly empirical approach that helps in building units and operating them, but does not help to elucidate the main features and characteristics of these units for better design, control, and optimization. It is shown in this paper that a better insight into the behaviour of these units can be achieved through the use of less empirical mathematical models coupled with industrial verifications. The present paper emphasizes the bifurcation behaviour of these industrial units.
