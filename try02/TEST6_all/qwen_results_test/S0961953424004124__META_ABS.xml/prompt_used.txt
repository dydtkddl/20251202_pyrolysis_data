You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research on the mechanism of hydrogen production by catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and polypropylene: An experimental and theoretical study The utilization of solid wastes such as biomass and plastics for energy production holds significant practical importance. This study conducts experimental research on microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of cotton stalks (CS) and polypropylene (PP) over alkali-modified HZSM-5 and Ni @ alkali-modified HZSM-5 for hydrogen production. The hydrogen production mechanism is carried out through experiments, reaction kinetics, and response surface method (RSM). The experimental results indicate that the optimal temperature for the co-CFP of CS and PP over 5%Ni-HT1.0 is 550 °C, and the hydrogen concentration is 37.9 vol%. The synergistic effect between CS and PP is explored by calculating comprehensive pyrolysis index. The activation energy is analyzed using the reaction kinetics Model-free integration methods (FWO and KAS), as well as model-fitting methods (CR). When the ratio of CS to PP is high (CS:PP = 1.0:0.5), the activation energy for the co-pyrolysis decreased. The addition of catalysts also has an important impact on the reduction of activation energy. By utilizing RSM to analyze the interactive effects on the generation of H2. This study provides a new approach for the co-pyrolysis of biomass such and plastics for hydrogen production.
