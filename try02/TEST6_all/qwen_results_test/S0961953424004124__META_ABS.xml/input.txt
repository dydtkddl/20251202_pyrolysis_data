Research on the mechanism of hydrogen production by catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of cotton stalks and polypropylene: An experimental and theoretical study The utilization of solid wastes such as biomass and plastics for energy production holds significant practical importance. This study conducts experimental research on microwave-assisted catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of cotton stalks (CS) and polypropylene (PP) over alkali-modified HZSM-5 and Ni @ alkali-modified HZSM-5 for hydrogen production. The hydrogen production mechanism is carried out through experiments, reaction kinetics, and response surface method (RSM). The experimental results indicate that the optimal temperature for the co-CFP of CS and PP over 5%Ni-HT1.0 is 550 °C, and the hydrogen concentration is 37.9 vol%. The synergistic effect between CS and PP is explored by calculating comprehensive pyrolysis index. The activation energy is analyzed using the reaction kinetics Model-free integration methods (FWO and KAS), as well as model-fitting methods (CR). When the ratio of CS to PP is high (CS:PP = 1.0:0.5), the activation energy for the co-pyrolysis decreased. The addition of catalysts also has an important impact on the reduction of activation energy. By utilizing RSM to analyze the interactive effects on the generation of H2. This study provides a new approach for the co-pyrolysis of biomass such and plastics for hydrogen production.
