You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development and validation of an analytical pyrolysis method for determination of microplastic polymers in atmospheric aerosols There is a need to develop analytical techniques for detection of airborne microplastic particles due to increasing evidence of their presence in ambient air and the associated possible health and climate effects. Many current analytical methods are limited by particle size and subjective visual evaluation. We have tested and validated an analytical pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, py-GC-MS, method that was developed specifically for detection of micro- and nanoplastic particles in aerosol samples. Some of the most common polymers, namely polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PU), polyamide (PA) and polystyrene (PS), were mixed and analyzed in atmospherically relevant sample matrices. A temperature-ramped selected ion monitoring (SIM) method was developed to detect them, based on characteristic pyrolysis products identified in pyrograms of each polymer individually and in their mixtures. Calibration curves in the range 10 ng – 1 µg were determined for each polymer with R2 values ranging from 0.72 to 0.99. A negative matrix effect was observed for reactive pyrolysis products, which was stronger in samples containing more aerosol matrix. This effect may be caused by secondary reactions between the pyrolysis products and aerosol matrix components. On the contrary a positive matrix effect was observed for PVC, possibly due to the addition of alkenes by the matrix which partake in radical reactions to form naphthalene. Deuterated polystyrene was tested as an internal standard to account for the matrix effect, but it was found to only be suitable for PS and PP. Other internal standards are thus needed for the other polymers. This study presents a method for direct analysis of aerosol particle samples with quantification of PP, PS, and PA on the nanogram scale and semi-quantification of PE, PU, PET, and PVC, also in the sub-microgram range.
