Microwave pyrolysis of Choerospondias axillaris seeds with their derived biochar for comprehensive utilization of the biomass Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising resource for producing biofuels with improved properties and has been extensively utilized in microwave pyrolysis. This study explores the use of Choerospondias axillaris seeds for bio-oil production, with the derived biochar serving as both a microwave absorber and in-situ catalyst. The research characterized the biochar including SEM, BET, NH3-TPD, FTIR, etc, and investigated the impact of different heating modes and types of microwave absorbers on the composition and distribution of pyrolysis products. The results demonstrated that the biochar exhibits excellent microwave absorption properties and catalytic performance. The biochar exhibits a dielectric loss tangent of 0.23 and a specific surface area of 154.54 m2·g−1, characterized by a rich hollow porous structure and surface functional groups. It contains metal elements such as Na, K, and Ca, along with Lewis acid sites, making it an excellent microwave absorption catalyst. Furthermore, the study investigated the effects of microwave power and pyrolysis temperature, revealing that optimal conditions of 700 W and 500 °C result in a fast heating rate of 77.7 °C·min−1, a bio-oil yield of 34.5 wt%, and an aromatics relative content of 61.0 %. The stability of the biochar as a microwave absorption catalyst was evaluated through a reuse study, demonstrating its relatively excellent warming characteristics and product distribution even after five cycles. In summary, this paper proposed an innovative method that employs the derived biochar to enhance biomass pyrolysis, thereby achieving the comprehensive and high-value utilization of Choerospondias axillaris seeds and providing a viable pathway for their sustainable development.
