You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave pyrolysis of Choerospondias axillaris seeds with their derived biochar for comprehensive utilization of the biomass Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising resource for producing biofuels with improved properties and has been extensively utilized in microwave pyrolysis. This study explores the use of Choerospondias axillaris seeds for bio-oil production, with the derived biochar serving as both a microwave absorber and in-situ catalyst. The research characterized the biochar including SEM, BET, NH3-TPD, FTIR, etc, and investigated the impact of different heating modes and types of microwave absorbers on the composition and distribution of pyrolysis products. The results demonstrated that the biochar exhibits excellent microwave absorption properties and catalytic performance. The biochar exhibits a dielectric loss tangent of 0.23 and a specific surface area of 154.54 m2·g−1, characterized by a rich hollow porous structure and surface functional groups. It contains metal elements such as Na, K, and Ca, along with Lewis acid sites, making it an excellent microwave absorption catalyst. Furthermore, the study investigated the effects of microwave power and pyrolysis temperature, revealing that optimal conditions of 700 W and 500 °C result in a fast heating rate of 77.7 °C·min−1, a bio-oil yield of 34.5 wt%, and an aromatics relative content of 61.0 %. The stability of the biochar as a microwave absorption catalyst was evaluated through a reuse study, demonstrating its relatively excellent warming characteristics and product distribution even after five cycles. In summary, this paper proposed an innovative method that employs the derived biochar to enhance biomass pyrolysis, thereby achieving the comprehensive and high-value utilization of Choerospondias axillaris seeds and providing a viable pathway for their sustainable development.
