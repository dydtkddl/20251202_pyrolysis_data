Valorisation of argemone mexicana seeds to renewable fuels by thermochemical conversion process In this paper, argemone mexicana seed was used for the production and characterization of biofuel and biochar using thermochemical conversion process. Thermal pyrolysis of Argemone mexicana seed was carried out in a semi- batch reactor in the temperature range of 400−600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min, maximum liquid product yield of 52 % was obtained at 550 °C. The obtained biofuel was analysed according to its fuel properties, functional groups and compounds present in it. The calorific value of the obtained biofuel was found to be 6542 kcal/kg which is less than diesel fuel. The morphological characteristics of bio-char was determined using SEM and BET analysis which revealed their macroporous surface with a less surface area of 0.208 m2/g. The calorific value of obtained bio-char was 2765.43 kcal/kg which is in the comparable range with solid fuel. The obtained results shows that the Argemone mexicana seed can be used as a potential feedstock of renewable fuels.
