You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Powder bed selective laser process (sintering/melting) applied to tailored calcium phosphate-based powders This paper focuses on the tailoring of calcium phosphate powders for their use as powder bed selective laser process feedstock. Hydroxyapatite and chlorapatite were used as starting powders for the preparation of different blends through the addition of graphite as a laser absorptance additive. A methodical study was conducted to compare the processing windows of the blends containing different amounts of graphite through the laser patterning of circular samples. It was found that the addition of graphite increases the process window of the powder blends being the powder without additive non processable. Hydroxyapatite showed a clear phase transition (decreased when using higher volumetric energy density) into other calcium phosphate phases while chlorapatite was demonstrated to be thermally stable during the whole process (examined through X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopies). In parallel, the study evaluating the powder blend composed of hydroxyapatite and graphite for the production of solid and complex parts was carried out although it required long printing times. The productivity of the process was improved by modification of printing parameters. Then, a series of solid samples were produced for the analysis of the microstructure and mechanical properties. High interconnected porosity was observed in the samples which could improve the bioactivity of the bioceramic scaffolds. A post-treatment of the parts increased their proportion in the hydroxyapatite phase and their mechanical properties. These results are expected to contribute to the application of powder bed selective laser processing of calcium phosphates powders toward bone tissue engineering.
