Effect of different temperatures on the properties of pyrolysis products of Parthenium hysterophorus This research encompasses the use of noxious weed Parthenium hysterophorus as feedstock for pyrolysis carried out at varying temperatures of 300, 450 and 600°C. Temperature significantly affected the yield and properties of the pyrolysis products including char, syngas and bio-oil. Biochar yield decreased from 61% to 37% from 300 °C to 600 °C, whereas yield of gas and oil increased with increasing temperature. The pyrolysis products were physico-chemically characterized. In biochar, pH, conductivity, fixed carbon, ash content, bulk density and specific surface area of the biochar increased whereas cation exchange capacity, calorific value, volatile matter, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen content decreased with increasing temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the biochar prepared at higher temperature was more stable. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry analysis of biochar indicated the presence of alkanes, alkenes, nitriles, fatty acids, esters, amides and aromatic compounds. Number of compounds decreased with increasing temperature, but aromatic compounds increased with increasing temperature. Scanning electron micrographs of biochar prepared at different temperatures indicated micropore formation at lower temperature while increase in the size of pores and disorganization of vessels occurred at increasing temperature. The chemical composition was found to be richer at lower pyrolysis temperature. GC–MS analysis of the bio-oil indicated the presence of phenols, ketones, acids, alkanes, alkenes, nitrogenated compounds, heterocyclics and benzene derivatives.
