Self-driving surrogate modeling for optimizing targeted bio-oil yield and heating value in waste biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis Optimizing bio‑oil yield and heating value in waste biomass‑plastic co‑pyrolysis is critical for advancing renewable energy production and sustainable waste management. However, traditional predictive models rely on static literature datasets and lack real‑time interaction between the prediction model and experimental feedback, leading to limited exploration of the parameter space, convergence on local minima, and an inability to correct discrepancies between predicted and actual experiment outcomes. To address these challenges, this study presents a self‑driving surrogate modeling framework that integrates a deep learning model pre‑trained on extensive literature data with iterative experimental updates via transfer learning and closed‑loop calibration. The framework dynamically and automatically adjusts its parameters in response to real‑time data and optimizes the plastic blend ratio to maximize both bio‑oil yield and heating value by the new experiment proposal. The results show that the source‑domain model achieved a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.967 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.06 for bio‑oil yield prediction from 56 data sources. Iterative calibration improved performance to R² values of 0.971 for bio-oil yield and 0.984 for heating value, with mean absolute percentage errors maintained below 1.0 %. The optimization result reveals that the blending condition suggested by the model improved the bio-oil yield from pure biomass pyrolysis to 60.72 % bio-oil and the higher heating value up to 42.15 megajoules per kilogram.
