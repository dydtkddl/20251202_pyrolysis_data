You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced CO2 capture using polystyrene-functionalized 5-amino-1H-tetrazole as an effective adsorbent: Synthesis, optimization, and performance evaluation Amine-functionalized adsorbents have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, developing cost-effective adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and superior cyclic stability remains challenging. This study synthesized and optimized a novel polystyrene-supported 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (PS-ATZ) adsorbent for enhanced CO2 capture. By employing Central Composite Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the adsorption conditions were finely tuned to maximize performance. Under optimal conditions, the adsorbent achieved a CO2 adsorption capacity of 11.105 mmol/g at 8.778 bar, 25.036 °C, and 10.556 % ATZ loading. Characterization revealed significant surface area and porosity enhancements. Isotherm studies indicated that the Hill isotherm model best fit the experimental data, suggesting cooperative adsorption. Kinetic studies showed that the fractional-order model best described the adsorption process, accounting for surface heterogeneity and multilayer adsorption. The thermodynamic analysis illustrated a spontaneous and exothermic adsorption process. Notably, the PS-ATZ adsorbent maintained high stability over multiple adsorption–desorption cycles, positioning it as a promising candidate for industrial CO2 capture and separation applications, particularly in scenarios requiring high efficiency and durability.
