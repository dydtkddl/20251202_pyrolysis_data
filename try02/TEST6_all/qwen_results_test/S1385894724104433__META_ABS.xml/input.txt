Enhanced CO2 capture using polystyrene-functionalized 5-amino-1H-tetrazole as an effective adsorbent: Synthesis, optimization, and performance evaluation Amine-functionalized adsorbents have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, developing cost-effective adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and superior cyclic stability remains challenging. This study synthesized and optimized a novel polystyrene-supported 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (PS-ATZ) adsorbent for enhanced CO2 capture. By employing Central Composite Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the adsorption conditions were finely tuned to maximize performance. Under optimal conditions, the adsorbent achieved a CO2 adsorption capacity of 11.105 mmol/g at 8.778 bar, 25.036 °C, and 10.556 % ATZ loading. Characterization revealed significant surface area and porosity enhancements. Isotherm studies indicated that the Hill isotherm model best fit the experimental data, suggesting cooperative adsorption. Kinetic studies showed that the fractional-order model best described the adsorption process, accounting for surface heterogeneity and multilayer adsorption. The thermodynamic analysis illustrated a spontaneous and exothermic adsorption process. Notably, the PS-ATZ adsorbent maintained high stability over multiple adsorption–desorption cycles, positioning it as a promising candidate for industrial CO2 capture and separation applications, particularly in scenarios requiring high efficiency and durability.
