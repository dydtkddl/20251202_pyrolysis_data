You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical simulation and experimental analysis of ablation response behavior of silicone rubber based flexible ablative material SR-FAMs play a critical role in the aerospace and fire protection sectors for thermal protection purpose. Nevertheless, the ablation mechanism and internal response behavior of SR-FAMs remain unclear because complex thermochemical reactions occur when they face with high temperature ablation conditions. In this work, a PDMS/CF/SiO2 composite containing 6 phr CF and 10 phr SiO2 was selected as the model system, and the pyrolysis mechanism of PDMS/CF/SiO2 composite was studied through a holistic analysis of the type of gaseous products, the composition of solid residue, and the evolution of microstructure at high temperatures. A multi-stage pyrolysis kinetic analysis was conducted to determine the kinetic parameters associating with each pyrolysis stage, which enabled accurate description of the thermal decomposition characteristics. Moreover, an ablation model was constructed to capture the ablation deformation and simulate ablation process of PDMS/CF/SiO2. The proposed model successfully predicted the time-dependent evolution of three-dimensional temperature fields, conversion of pyrolysis products, gas-phase flow, and pressure distribution. The simulation results indicated that the transition of horizontal-to-vertical gas flow promoted the formation of columnar barrier structures in the char layer of PDMS/CF/SiO2. The results of the numerical model agreed well with experimental data in terms of LAR, MAR, surface and back-face temperature, with a prediction error less than 5%. This work provided new insights into the ablation behavior of SR-FAMs and offered reference to the design and optimization of flexible thermal protection materials.
