You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive study of the influence of post-processing on the microstructure evolution and high-temperature performance of Haynes 230 superalloy manufactured by laser-powder bed fusion This study evaluates the effects of various post-processing treatments on the nickel-based HA230 superalloy processed by Laser Powder Bed Fusion. The study focuses on microstructural features, deformation, and fracture behavior at room temperature and at an elevated temperature of 850 °C. Post-processing consists of a series of heat treatment regimes, including solution annealing (SA) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1160 and 1200 °C, as well as a combination of these treatments. A parametric study revealed that, in the as-built state, a higher number of solid-state cracks and various types of defects were present in the microstructure. There was found significant reduction of both cracks and defects after implementing HIP in combination with SA, which achieved nearly complete densification. Combining HIP at 1200 °C also induces an extensive static recrystallization, resulting in a significant reduction in dislocation density and the GOSS texture component, as well as the formation of coarse columnar grains. The SA state exhibits the highest mechanical properties at room temperature, while the combined treatment of HIP and SA reaches the highest values at elevated temperatures. The sustained high strain hardening ability at elevated temperatures is associated with a combination of carbides, low-angle grain boundaries, and nano-twins. Regardless of the heat treatment, the fracture behavior at room temperature exhibits a transcrystalline ductile fracture with checkerboard morphological features. The morphology transforms into an array of voids at 850 °C, accompanied by the formation of intercrystalline fracture features. This phenomenon is further amplified by both HIP regimes.
