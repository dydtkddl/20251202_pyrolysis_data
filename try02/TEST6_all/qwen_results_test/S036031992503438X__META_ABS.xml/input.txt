Enhanced catalyst dip coating on structured metal support for methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation Additive manufacturing enables the design of metal periodic cellular structures as advanced catalyst carriers, but efficient coating methods remain challenging. Here we presents a robust approach for coating metal substrates, including perforated stainless-steel sheets and twisted copper wires, achieving a high catalyst loading of 0.05 mg mm−2 and minimal mass loss of 0.76 wt% after a 10-min stability test. Notably, the copper substrate resists oxidation during coating while offering superior thermal conductivity, making it an extraordinary catalyst support. To assess its performance, a modeling study was conducted on methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation in a continuous flow reactor. Compared to a packed bed, the structured copper catalyst exhibited 21 % higher conversion rates, demonstrating the benefits of enhanced heat transfer. A long-term MCH dehydrogenation experiment further confirms the practical coating stability and sustained catalytic activity. This work provides an effective coating strategy for thermally conductive metal substrates made from powders compatible with additive manufacturing, offering significant potential for improving heterogeneous catalytic reactor performance.
