You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced catalyst dip coating on structured metal support for methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation Additive manufacturing enables the design of metal periodic cellular structures as advanced catalyst carriers, but efficient coating methods remain challenging. Here we presents a robust approach for coating metal substrates, including perforated stainless-steel sheets and twisted copper wires, achieving a high catalyst loading of 0.05 mg mm−2 and minimal mass loss of 0.76 wt% after a 10-min stability test. Notably, the copper substrate resists oxidation during coating while offering superior thermal conductivity, making it an extraordinary catalyst support. To assess its performance, a modeling study was conducted on methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation in a continuous flow reactor. Compared to a packed bed, the structured copper catalyst exhibited 21 % higher conversion rates, demonstrating the benefits of enhanced heat transfer. A long-term MCH dehydrogenation experiment further confirms the practical coating stability and sustained catalytic activity. This work provides an effective coating strategy for thermally conductive metal substrates made from powders compatible with additive manufacturing, offering significant potential for improving heterogeneous catalytic reactor performance.
