You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles, characterization, and biosensing applications This comprehensive review provides an in-depth overview of the green (biological) synthesis, characterization, and biosensor applications of metal nanoparticles (NPs). Because of their unique physical and chemical properties, high surface area, and nanoscale size, NPs have become crucial in various fields. The review emphasizes the synthesis, properties, and applications of several metal NPs, particularly silver (AgNPs), gold (AuNPs), platinum (PtNPs), copper (CuNPs), zinc oxide (ZnONPs), iron oxide (FeONPs), and palladium (PdNPs). Green synthesis methods, a truly innovative approach, utilize biological substances such as plant extracts, bacteria, fungi, and yeast. These methods offer environmentally friendly and biologically compatible alternatives to conventional chemical synthesis techniques. This review details these sustainable approaches and their advantages over traditional methods. These natural sources provide an abundant, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable alternative for NP production. The importance of thorough characterization of nanoparticles is also discussed, highlighting techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV–Vis spectroscopy to analyze the size, shape, surface properties, structural integrity, and optical behavior of the NPs. The review highlights the vast potential of metal NPs in biosensors, which play a critical role in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety. Incorporating metal NPs in electrochemical, optical, thermometric, and piezoelectric biosensors significantly enhances sensitivity and specificity, enabling rapid and real-time detection of various analytes.
