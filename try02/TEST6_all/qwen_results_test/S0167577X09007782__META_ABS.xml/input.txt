A novel non-catalytic approach for fabrication of bamboo-like carbon nanotubes Bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (BCNTs) were synthesized via pyrolysis of PMMA@PDVB core–shell spheres in argon atmosphere at 900°C without any metallic catalyst. TEM and HRTEM observations show the carbon nanotubes with bamboo-like structure. The content of polymerized divinylbenzene (PDVB) in the core–shell nanostructures plays a very important role for the formation of BCNTs. The possible growth mechanism for BCNTs is proposed.
