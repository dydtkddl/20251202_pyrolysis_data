You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Earth-abundant transition metal and metal oxide nanomaterials: Synthesis and electrochemical applications Earth-abundant transition metal and metal oxide (EATM&MO) nanomaterials offer numerous positive attributes such as catalytic activity, selective enzyme-mimicking catalysis, energy harvesting and storage, green chemistry and atom economy guided by size and morphology induced intrinsic properties at the nanoscale. Noble metal nanomaterials have long been played a central role and highly efficient for various electrochemical applications but their high cost and least abundance unfortunately make them less attractive towards industrial applications. In this perspective, the design and development of EATM&MO nanomaterials with unique features are imperative in the fabrication of potential electrochemical devices. This review gives an account of the various emerging synthesis of EATM&MO nanomaterials and their nanocomposites using numerous chemical strategies for the state-of-the-art electrochemical applications. A variety of synthetic strategies for the production of diverse size-, morphology-, and composition- controlled EATM&MO nanomaterials has been described for emerging applications such as sensing and biosensing, fuel cells, photovoltaics, water electrolyzer, photo-electrochemical water electrolyzer, and energy storage systems (Lithium Ion Batteries, LIBs). Recent progress, important approaches, structure property relations, and future outlook towards the EATM&MO nanomaterials fabrication for diverse electrochemical devices are highlighted.
