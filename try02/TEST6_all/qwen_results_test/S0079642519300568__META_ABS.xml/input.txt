Earth-abundant transition metal and metal oxide nanomaterials: Synthesis and electrochemical applications Earth-abundant transition metal and metal oxide (EATM&MO) nanomaterials offer numerous positive attributes such as catalytic activity, selective enzyme-mimicking catalysis, energy harvesting and storage, green chemistry and atom economy guided by size and morphology induced intrinsic properties at the nanoscale. Noble metal nanomaterials have long been played a central role and highly efficient for various electrochemical applications but their high cost and least abundance unfortunately make them less attractive towards industrial applications. In this perspective, the design and development of EATM&MO nanomaterials with unique features are imperative in the fabrication of potential electrochemical devices. This review gives an account of the various emerging synthesis of EATM&MO nanomaterials and their nanocomposites using numerous chemical strategies for the state-of-the-art electrochemical applications. A variety of synthetic strategies for the production of diverse size-, morphology-, and composition- controlled EATM&MO nanomaterials has been described for emerging applications such as sensing and biosensing, fuel cells, photovoltaics, water electrolyzer, photo-electrochemical water electrolyzer, and energy storage systems (Lithium Ion Batteries, LIBs). Recent progress, important approaches, structure property relations, and future outlook towards the EATM&MO nanomaterials fabrication for diverse electrochemical devices are highlighted.
