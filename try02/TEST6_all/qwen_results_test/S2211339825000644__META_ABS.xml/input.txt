Kinetic modeling for radical polymerization and depolymerization Radical polymerization and its reverse process, radical depolymerization, are central to modern polymer manufacturing and recycling strategies. This review highlights recent advances in understanding the mechanisms and modeling techniques. Enhanced deterministic and stochastic models have successfully described the complexities of radical polymerization processes. Parallel breakthroughs in radical depolymerization kinetics, particularly through end-group-assisted unzipping and visible-light activation, have facilitated efficient monomer recovery under milder reaction conditions. Additionally, advanced modeling leveraging quantum chemistry and machine learning and experimental validations has significantly boosted predictive accuracy. By integrating state-of-the-art kinetic modeling with sustainable design principles, researchers are progressively establishing foundations for closed-loop polymer lifecycles.
