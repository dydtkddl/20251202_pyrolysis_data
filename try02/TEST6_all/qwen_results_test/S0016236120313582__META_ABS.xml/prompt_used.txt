You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pickering HIPEs derived hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon supported bimetallic AuPd catalyst for base-free aerobic oxidation of HMF to FDCA in water As an important renewable alternative to the production of petroleum-derived terephthalic acid, selective aerobic oxidation of biomass derivative 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into high value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is attracting increasing attention. Herein, a novel hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) supported bimetallic AuPd catalyst was synthesized by Pickering high internal phase emulsions (Pickering HIPEs) templating method, subsequent carbonization and the sol-curing technique. By varying Pickering HIPEs parameter, nitrogen-doped content and the loaded AuPd nanoparticles, AuxPdy/NC catalysts with adjustable porous structure and basicity were obtained. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the high basicity of NC support and efficient bimetallic AuPd catalyst, tandem oxidation of HMF to FDCA reactions can be carried out under base-free condition in water, which makes the biomass transformation process environmental friendliness and economic. And the highest yield of FDCA at 96.7% was achieved under the optimal reaction conditions. Regeneration test revealed the obtained AuxPdy/NC catalyst was recovered and reused at least five times without significant loss of catalytic activity. The present work offers a versatile strategy for developing nitrogen-doped carbon supported highly efficient bimetallic catalysts with hierarchical porous structure and adjusting basicity for a wide range of base-free catalytic oxidation in water.
