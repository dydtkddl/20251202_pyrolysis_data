You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste to alternative aviation fuels: A review The depletion of fossil fuel sources and the urgency to combat global warming have led to extensive research into renewable energy alternatives. Among these alternatives, biofuel is emerging as a promising replacement for petroleum fuel. The aviation industry, which produces significant CO2 emissions annually, recognizes the need for sustainable solutions to minimize its carbon footprint. Biomass-to-liquid thermochemical routes, a cornerstone in sustainable hydrocarbon fuel production, are particularly pivotal for bio-jet fuel synthesis. Among the diverse thermal conversion technologies, pyrolysis holds promise for transforming waste biomass and plastic into liquid fuels. However, the ensuing oil from renewable biological sources and/or waste plastics from pyrolysis poses significant challenges due to its inferior quality, characterized by oxygenated compounds and high water content. The resulting oil from renewable biological sources and/or waste plastics is chemically unstable, viscous, and corrosive, necessitating thorough upgrading for its viable use as a kerosene fraction or blend. This review focuses on catalytic post-treatment strategies for enhancing oil from renewable biological sources and/or waste plastics quality, specifically emphasizing catalytic processes, including catalytic pyrolysis, deoxygenation, isomerization, and cracking. Drawing insights from the latest literature, the article navigates through recent advancements and challenges in converting authentic pyrolysis oil alternative jet fuel. Special attention is given to elucidating the intricate conversion pathways, shedding light on catalytic pyrolysis and hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation routes.
