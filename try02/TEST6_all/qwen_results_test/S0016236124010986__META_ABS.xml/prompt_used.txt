You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene to co-produce BTX aromatics and H2 by Ni/ZSM-5 in the rotary reactor with solid heat carriers Plastic waste pollution has become a crucial concern in the field of environmental conservation. Catalytic pyrolysis offers an appealing and efficient technology that can convert plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or valuable chemical products. This provides a practical solution to address the challenges associated with waste management. In this research, an innovative approach of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis was employed in a rotary reactor with solid heat carriers, along with a Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, to simultaneously produce BTX aromatics and hydrogen from polyethylene. Experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the characteristics of the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. This was achieved by adjusting the metallic nickel loadings on the ZSM-5 support. Next, the effect of Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts and the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio on the selectivity of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil and hydrogen was examined. The results revealed that as the metallic nickel loading increased to 10 wt%, the concentration of BTX aromatics in the pyrolysis oil also increased and reached a maximum of 59.2%. Furthermore, the hydrogen gas fraction in the pyrolysis gas was 58.0 vol% when using the 10Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process. The Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated a significant positive effect in cleaving the H∙ group. By varying the catalyst-to-polyethylene mass ratio from 0.5 to 2, the concentration of monocyclic aromatics in the pyrolysis oil increased from 68.2% to 87.7%. However, the catalyst-to-feed ratio had an insignificant impact on the hydrogen fraction in the pyrolysis gas, with the hydrogen gas fraction ranging from 43.9 vol% to 46.8 vol%. Additionally, this study provided insights into the potential mechanism of in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene within the rotary kiln.
