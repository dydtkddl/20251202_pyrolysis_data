You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of flame retardants and Sb2O3 synergist on the thermal decomposition of high-impact polystyrene and on its debromination by ammonia treatment Brominated high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br) with 10.8wt% bromine (Br) coming from 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)oxide or 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)ethane flame retardant and with or without 5wt% antimony trioxide (Sb2O3) synergist were thermally degraded at 450°C into liquid products (oils). The composition of hydrocarbons and Br-containing compounds in oils was determined by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) or with mass selective detector (GC-MSD). It was found that the flame retardants had small effect on the composition of pyrolysis oils: 1,2-bis(pentabromophenyl)ethane increased the unsaturated compounds of PhCC type to the detriment of ethylbenzene. Contrary, the synergist had more remarkable effect on the pyrolysis of HIPS-Br. Decomposition started faster giving lower amount of gases, oils with higher density and more pyrolysis residue. Pyrolysis oils contained more saturated aromatic compounds (of Ph-C n H2n +1 type), more trimers and polycyclic compounds and less unsaturated Ph-CC compounds. Cyclisation and dehydrogenation of styrene dimers was inhibited therefore less phenyl- and phenylmethyl-naphthalene was produced. Ammonia acted as a trap for the hydrobromic acid. More than 90wt% of initial bromine in the samples was recovered as inorganic ammonium bromide. The Sb2O3 synergist had stronger debromination effect in the presence of ammonia.
