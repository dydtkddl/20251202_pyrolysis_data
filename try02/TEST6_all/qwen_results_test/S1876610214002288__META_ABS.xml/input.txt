Fuel Oil Production from Municipal Plastic Wastes in Sequential Pyrolysis and Catalytic Reforming Reactors The aim of this research was to study fuel oil production from municipal plastic wastes by sequential pyrolysis and catalytic reforming processes. Three kinds of municipal plastic wastes were collected from the final disposal site and the small recycling company in Yogyakarta city, Indonesia. Commercial Y-zeolite and natural zeolite catalysts were used in this study. The results show that the feedstock types strongly affect the product yields and the quality of liquid and solid products. HDPE waste produced the highest liquid fraction. The catalyst presences reduced the liquid fraction and increased the gaseous fraction. Furthermore, municipal plastic wastes pyrolysis produced higher heating value solid products than those of biomass and low rank coal.
