You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel biphasic approach for direct fabrication of highly porous, flexible conducting carbon nanofiber mats from polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/NaHCO3 nanocomposite A novel method for the development of porous, flexible carbon nanofibers from a bead-free, electrospun Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) nanocomposite fibers using thermally induced selective removal mechanism is reported. Uniform size distribution of ball-milled NaHCO3 nanoparticles in PAN nanofibers provided an effective pathway for the creation of homogenous mesopores in carbon nanofibers with reduced fiber diameter. Structural and morphological characterization using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman Spectroscopy revealed the evolution of porous carbon nanofibers from electrospun PAN/NaHCO3 nanocomposite fibers during the controlled thermal treatment process and the formation of graphitic crystallites in the networks of nanofibers. The micro/mesopores having uniform size distribution was created on the surface of the nanofibers as well as inside the fibers creating a porous fiber assembly. The mesoporous carbon nanofibers exhibited high specific surface area of ∼724 m2 g−1 and excellent electrical conductivity of 294 S/m which suggests their promising application as a high-performance catalyst support material in fuel cells.
