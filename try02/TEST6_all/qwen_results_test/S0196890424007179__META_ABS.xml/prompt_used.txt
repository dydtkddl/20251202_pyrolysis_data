You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review of development and applications of hydrogen energy technologies in China for carbon neutrality: Technology advances and challenges Concerning the transition from a carbon-based energy economy to a renewable energy economy, hydrogen is considered an essential energy carrier for efficient and broad energy systems in China in the near future. China aims to gradually replace fossil fuel-based power generation with renewable energy technologies to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. This ambitious undertaking will involve building an industrial production chain spanning the production, storage, transportation, and utilisation of hydrogen energy by 2030 (when China’s carbon peak will be reached). This review analyses the current status of technological R&D in China’s hydrogen energy industry. Based on published data in the open literature, we compared the costs and carbon emissions for grey, blue, and green hydrogen production. The primary challenges concerning hydrogen transportation and storage are highlighted in this study. Given that primary carbon emissions in China are a result of power generation using fossil fuels, we provide an overview of the advances in hydrogen-to-power industry technology R&D, including hydrogen-related power generation technology, hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen internal combustion engines, hydrogen gas turbines, and catalytic hydrogen combustion using liquid hydrogen carriers (e.g. ammonia, methanol, and ethanol).
