A review on the evolution of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and its future prospects The environmental pollution crisis and the new environmental legislations have facilitated the need for cleaner-burning gasoline. Oxygenate additives, which can increase the octane rating and induce complete fuel combustion, play increasingly important roles in the development of a greener and more sustainable environment. In this short review, one of the better-known oxygenate additives, ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), is discussed; this compound gained interest after the limitations and negative impacts caused by the addition of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) to gasoline were discovered. The discussion focuses on the trends in ETBE production and on the evolution of conventional separation techniques toward the development of hybrid processes. Moreover, a new concept that involves the use of nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes) in the production and separation of ETBE is proposed and discussed.
