Catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires over Bi-metallic USY for the production of hydrogen and light gases Catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires over Ultra-Stable Y (USY) zeolite support was studied to evaluate how inexpensive transition-metal promoters steer gas/liquid selectivity and product quality. Building on prior monometallic USY-supported systems, this study presents the first systematic assessment of transition-metal promoters (Ce, Fe, Zn, Cu) on Ni/USY for waste-tire pyrolysis, undertaken to compare product distributions and target higher H2 production. The results of this study offer a feasible route to co-produce hydrogen-rich gas and high-value light aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylenes…) from waste tires, by using inexpensive transition metal-promoted zeolite catalysts. 5Ni/USY tripled the hydrogen content of the product gas to 59.37 % and cut the C11+ fraction of the liquid phase by 70 % relative to the parent USY. Among the bimetallic catalysts, 5Ni-1Ce/USY raised H2 content of the gas output to 61.93 % and further enriched the oil product in single-ring aromatics (p-xylene, ethylbenzene). H2-TPR revealed a 30°C upward shift in the main Ni-reduction peak indicating stronger Ni-support interaction in the Ce-promoted catalyst and XPS results suggest finer dispersion and lower outer-surface Ni exposure. TGA and XRD analyses of spent catalysts showed that 5Ni/USY and 5Ni-1Ce/USY produced mainly graphitic carbon, whereas Fe- and Cu-based catalysts accumulated amorphous carbon. Therefore, the controlled Ce promotion of Ni/USY offers a low-cost route to maximize H2 and light aromatics while mitigating coking during waste tire pyrolysis.
