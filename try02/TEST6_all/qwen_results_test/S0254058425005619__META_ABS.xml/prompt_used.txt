You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Response surface method design of nano-copper modified coffee shell biochar to treat copper cyanide wastewater: Characterization and catalytic oxidation adsorption mechanism Utilizing dihydrate copper chloride as an impregnating agent, nano-copper-loaded coffee husk biochar (HBC-Cu) was synthesized through a one-step carbothermal reduction method, which was employed for the treatment of copper cyanide complexes ([ ) present in copper cyanide wastewater. Characterization of HBC-Cu was conducted utilizing various techniques, including infrared spectroscopy, surface area analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. A Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented to assess the influence of preparation variables on adsorption by biochar, specifically: A(the mass ratio of ( ) to HBC (1–2 g)), B( impregnation duration (12–18 h)), and C( carbonization temperature (700–900 ℃)). The ANOVA results of the BBD model indicated a p -value of less than 0.0001, accompanied by an F-value of 951.17. The equilibrium adsorption curve illustrated that the adsorption process was exothermic and could be more accurately represented by the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. The maximum adsorption capacity of HBC-Cu was determined to be 132.21 mg g − 1 , with catalytic oxidation identified as the predominant adsorption mechanism. The findings indicate that HBC-Cu is an effective and promising adsorbent for treating copper cyanide wastewater.
