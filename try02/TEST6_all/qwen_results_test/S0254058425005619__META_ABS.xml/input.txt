Response surface method design of nano-copper modified coffee shell biochar to treat copper cyanide wastewater: Characterization and catalytic oxidation adsorption mechanism Utilizing dihydrate copper chloride as an impregnating agent, nano-copper-loaded coffee husk biochar (HBC-Cu) was synthesized through a one-step carbothermal reduction method, which was employed for the treatment of copper cyanide complexes ([ ) present in copper cyanide wastewater. Characterization of HBC-Cu was conducted utilizing various techniques, including infrared spectroscopy, surface area analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction. A Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented to assess the influence of preparation variables on adsorption by biochar, specifically: A(the mass ratio of ( ) to HBC (1–2 g)), B( impregnation duration (12–18 h)), and C( carbonization temperature (700–900 ℃)). The ANOVA results of the BBD model indicated a p -value of less than 0.0001, accompanied by an F-value of 951.17. The equilibrium adsorption curve illustrated that the adsorption process was exothermic and could be more accurately represented by the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetics. The maximum adsorption capacity of HBC-Cu was determined to be 132.21 mg g − 1 , with catalytic oxidation identified as the predominant adsorption mechanism. The findings indicate that HBC-Cu is an effective and promising adsorbent for treating copper cyanide wastewater.
