You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gasification of coal and PET in fluidized bed reactor Blended fuel comprising 23wt.% polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and 77wt.% brown coal was gasified in an atmospheric fluidized bed gasifier of laboratory-scale. The gasification agent was composed of 10vol.% O2 in bulk of nitrogen. Thermal and texture analyses were carried out to determine the basic properties of the fuel components. The influence of experimental conditions, such as the fluidized bed and freeboard temperatures on major and minor gas components and tar content, as well as features of the blended fuel gasification in comparison with the single coal gasification, were studied. In the case of coal with PET gasification, only the fluidized bed temperature showed significant influence on CO, CO2, CH4 and H2 content in the producer gas, whereas the effect of the freeboard temperature was insignificant. In single coal gasification both temperatures had considerable and almost the same influence. The content of minor components, such as ethane, ethylene, acetylene and benzene, was found to be more dependent on the freeboard temperature than on the fluidized bed temperature. It was observed that the higher the freeboard temperatures get, the lower is the concentration of the minor components, with the exception of acetylene. The absolute contents of almost all minor and tar components were approximately three times higher in blended fuel gasification than that in single coal gasification. Finally, partition of carbon (char) and selected metals into bottom and cyclone ash in gasification of both fuels is discussed.
