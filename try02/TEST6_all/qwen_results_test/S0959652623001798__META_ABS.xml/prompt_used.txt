You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on pyrolysis from the circular economy point of view and its environmental and social effects The rising volume of waste created worldwide due to industrialization and commercial activity necessitates a method of waste management that is both effective and efficient. However, waste management is linked to unsustainable patterns in a linear economic system. On the contrary, a circular economy (CE) is widely perceived to solve various issues, including resource scarcity and long-term economic benefits. Utilizing pyrolysis to convert waste to energy and valuable compounds is a potential method for reducing waste while producing valuable end products. The current article offers a thorough analysis of pyrolysis from a circular economy point of view. First, the nature of pyrolysis is briefly described to understand subsequent concepts better. In the following, the pyrolysis of three types of waste, including tire, plastic, and biomass, is deeply investigated from the CE aspect. Then, the social and environmental impacts of pyrolysis from the life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective in developed and developing countries are scrutinized. In the end, ongoing challenges and suggestions for future research are also discussed. Pyrolysis products have not yet been standardized for trade in the market. However, pyrolysis might be able to close the loop of energy and materials. Also, LCA results revealed that pyrolysis has acceptable environmental impacts and a low global warming potential (GWP).
