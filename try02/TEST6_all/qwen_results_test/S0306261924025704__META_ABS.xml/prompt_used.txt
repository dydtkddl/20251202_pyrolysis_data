You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel photo-thermal chemical looping water splitting technology to achieve efficient and stable hydrogen production under mild condition The high operational temperatures constrain the practical application of chemical looping steam reforming coupled with water splitting (CLSR-WS) technology. Herein, we first propose a novel photo-thermal CLSR-WS technology to lower the temperature by introducing photothermal coupling catalysis. Under light irradiation, abundant oxygen vacancy (VO) generates on the surface of oxygen carriers (OCs), facilitating the migration of lattice oxygen and the adsorption of gaseous reactants during CLSR. This innovation results in an impressive H2 yield of 8.26 mmol/g OC with 98.14 % purity at 550 °C, comprehensively surpassing the traditional benchmark performance at 800 °C. The reduction of temperature leads to the enhancement in syngas yield and H2 purity, together with a cyclic stability. Co-Fe oxides are found as the suitable OCs for this new technology. Benefitting from the reduced energy of VO formation and bandgap, Co-Fe OCs could utilize the longer-wavelength light to generate VO. Our findings offer a pathway for overcoming the high-temperature bottleneck in CLSR-WS and achieving efficient and stable H2 production under moderate conditions.
