You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of plastics and food waste mixture under flue gas condition for bio-oil production Growing global population increased the energy demand and generation of municipal solid wastes (MSW). MSW can be utilized to produce green renewable fuels via pyrolysis technology. This study investigated the co-pyrolysis of MSW represented by mixtures of food and plastic wastes, in a downdraft pyrolyzer using synthetic flue gas composition. The food wastes in this study included fish and chicken bones, and leftover rice, and plastics included polypropylene and polyethylene (high density and low density) plastics respectively. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and types of feedstocks on the bio-oil yield and quality were determined. Although the highest bio-oil yield was obtained at 400 °C for all feedstocks, GC–MS results indicated major compounds such as fatty acids, esters, amides, nitriles, sugars were more notable at 300 °C. The bio-oil exhibited high water contents due to combustion from the flue gas. Fish bone and plastic mixture has the lowest O/C ratio and the best calorific value of 33.9 MJ/kg compared to the other two feedstocks, however extensive treatments were required to be used as fuel. Overall, bio-oil from this study has the potential to be used as an alternative fuel from co-pyrolysis of food and plastic wastes with further treatments and processing.
