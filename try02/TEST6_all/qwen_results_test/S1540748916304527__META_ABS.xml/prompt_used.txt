You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of biomass particle size on bed agglomeration during biomass pyrolysis in fluidised bed Bed agglomeration in fluidised bed was recently discovered to be an important consideration during biomass pyrolysis under the conditions pertinent to bio-oil production. The results in this study show that biomass particle size has a significant effect on bed agglomeration during biomass fast pyrolysis at 500°C. Sand loading, which is defined as the mass of sand sticking to the biomass particles normalised to the total mass of biomass fed, is used for quantifying the interaction between the pyrolysing biomass particle and sand in fluidised bed to form bed agglomerates. Under the experimental conditions, at biomass particle sizes ≤430µm, sand loading increases with increasing biomass particle size. At biomass particle sizes >430µm, sand loading decreases with further increase in biomass particle size. The results further show that mass transfer of the sticky agent produced from biomass pyrolysis plays a key role in bed agglomeration. At small particle sizes (≤430µm), sand loading is dominantly influenced by convective mass transfer of sticky agent while at large particle sizes (>430µm), sand loading is mainly controlled by diffusive mass transfer of sticky agent within the pyrolysing biomass particle.
