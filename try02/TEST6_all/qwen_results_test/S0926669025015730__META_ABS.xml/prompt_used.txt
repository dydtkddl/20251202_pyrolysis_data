You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tannic acid-enriched polyurethanes: Synthesis, properties, and application potential Polyurethanes find wide application in various industries, including transportation, automotive, medical, sports, and construction, due to their remarkable tailor-made properties, processability, and biocompatibility. Tannic acid, a natural and non-toxic polyphenolic compound, possesses many beneficial properties, including the promotion of tissue repair, flame resistance, corrosion inhibition, and desired biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, the utility of tannic acid is limited due to its limited environmental stability, inherent biodegradability, and sensitivity to external disturbances. To enhance its functional properties, tannic acid is frequently subjected to chemical modification or incorporated into polymeric matrices and composite systems. “Incorporating tannic acid into polyurethane matrices imparts a broad spectrum of desirable properties for different applications, such as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, improved biocompatibility, increased thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and flame retardancy.”A variety of products, including hydrogels, elastomers, fibers, and foams, along with composites derived from tannic acid and polyurethanes, have been developed for diverse applications. This review highlights the key properties of tannic acid and summarizes recent research on tannic acid–based polyurethanes, with emphasis on their synthesis strategies and applications in antibacterial coatings, wound dressings, tissue engineering, flame retarded polymers, water purification, and food packaging.
