You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Petroleum-like fuels with substantially enriched branched iso-paraffins and benzenes via boehmite-assisted pyrolysis of oil shale Oil shale (OS) is a potential alternative to substitute/supplement traditional fossil fuels, where catalyst-assisted OS pyrolysis has become a subject of general concern. While great progresses have been realized in this field, the pursuit of high-performance catalysts for a niche OS utilization still remains a formidable challenge, because most of the catalysts face various problems, including, high cost, unsatisfactory performances, etc. Based on a two-stage flash pyrolysis, we herein report our efforts about this issue by using boehmite, a low-cost industrially relevant material of an easy availability, as catalyst. We show that boehmite could arouse 17.0 % decreases in activation energy of OS pyrolysis. When the pyrolysis is executed at the 1st stage (450 °C), the content of hydrocarbons and short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (≤C13), which are desired for petroleum-like fuels (PLFs), increases evidently by 56.73 % and 158.5 %, respectively, while that of heteroatomic compounds and long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (≥C20), which are undesired for PLFs, decreases distinctly by 60.09 % and 41.6 %, respectively, indicating an evident improvement in the quality of the pyrolysates. Fascinatingly, the content of branched iso-paraffins, especially, monomethyl-, dimethyl- and trimethyl-branched paraffins, which are either efficient octane number boosters, important tectons for functional surfactants, or significant component for high-quality fuels of excellent low-temperature performances, increases substantially by ca. 180.2 % from ca. 16.02 % to 44.89 %. For the 2nd stage at 585 °C, besides a distinctly improved quality of the pyrolysates, the content of benzene, toluene, xylene and trimethylbenzene, which are value-added chemicals broadly employed in numerous industrial fields of paramount importance, is enriched distinctly by 94 %, 65.2 %, 13 %, and 19 %, respectively. We find that the concentration of the Brönsted acid sites (BASs) of the employed boehmite, which contain 94 % medium and strong BASs, is substantially lower than that of Lewis acid sites (LASs), which contain merely 54.91 % medium and strong LASs, such that the competitive-collaborative actions of BASs and LASs confer boehmite with outstanding catalytic reactivity.
