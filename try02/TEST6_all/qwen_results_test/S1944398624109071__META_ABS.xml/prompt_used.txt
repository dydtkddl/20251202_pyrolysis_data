You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study on the removal of methyl orange using zeolite/biochar- supported iron oxide catalyst from industrial by-products Biochar- and zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst (BC-Fe and Z-Fe, respectively), were prepared from industrial by-products using a solvent-free method. The effectiveness of the prepared catalysts was tested by conducting batch experiments to remove methyl orange (MO) dye from dye-laden water. The optimum process variables for a maximum removal efficiency were identified using the Box–Behnken design of experiments (DoE) technique. The variables chosen were contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH, and initial adsorbate dosage. BC-Fe has a removal efficiency of 95% at a high acidic pH with a lower adsorbent concentration (3–5 g/L), as compared to that of the Z-Fe adsorbent (4–5 g/L). The higher surface area and pore volume of BC-Fe (66.998 m2/g, 17 cc/g) than that of Z-Fe (50.039 m2/g, 13.07 cc/g) resulted in a better removal efficiency with a low adsorbent dosage. Statistical verification was performed to check the real-time robustness of the developed Box–Behnken DoE model. The methyl orange (MO) dye adsorption was best described by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms. Kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with rate constants of 0.01156 (BC-Fe) and 0.02063 g/mg·min (Z-Fe) was the best fit for adsorption. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic with an increase in randomness at the solid–liquid interface.
