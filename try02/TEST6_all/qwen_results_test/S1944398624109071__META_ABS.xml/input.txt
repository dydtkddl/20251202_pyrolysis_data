Comparative study on the removal of methyl orange using zeolite/biochar- supported iron oxide catalyst from industrial by-products Biochar- and zeolite-supported iron oxide catalyst (BC-Fe and Z-Fe, respectively), were prepared from industrial by-products using a solvent-free method. The effectiveness of the prepared catalysts was tested by conducting batch experiments to remove methyl orange (MO) dye from dye-laden water. The optimum process variables for a maximum removal efficiency were identified using the Box–Behnken design of experiments (DoE) technique. The variables chosen were contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH, and initial adsorbate dosage. BC-Fe has a removal efficiency of 95% at a high acidic pH with a lower adsorbent concentration (3–5 g/L), as compared to that of the Z-Fe adsorbent (4–5 g/L). The higher surface area and pore volume of BC-Fe (66.998 m2/g, 17 cc/g) than that of Z-Fe (50.039 m2/g, 13.07 cc/g) resulted in a better removal efficiency with a low adsorbent dosage. Statistical verification was performed to check the real-time robustness of the developed Box–Behnken DoE model. The methyl orange (MO) dye adsorption was best described by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms. Kinetic studies revealed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with rate constants of 0.01156 (BC-Fe) and 0.02063 g/mg·min (Z-Fe) was the best fit for adsorption. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic with an increase in randomness at the solid–liquid interface.
