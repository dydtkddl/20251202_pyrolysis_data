You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A roadmap of MOFs derived porous carbon, oxides, chalcogenides, and phosphides of metals: Synthesis, properties, parameter modulation and their utilization as an electrode for Li/Na/K-ion batteries Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are extensively studied nanomaterials known for their advantageous properties, including good porosity and high surface area. MOFs have garnered significant attention for their role as templates in producing tailored MOF-derived nanomaterials in the realm of energy storage devices. These MOF-derived materials, encompassing metal oxide, porous carbon, and metal oxide@C composites, have exhibited outstanding performance in energy storage devices. While the application of MOFs in deriving phosphides, sulfides and selenides has gained interest, it remains an area with untapped potential. This review provides a comprehensive overview of MOF's evolution from their pristine form to highly functionalized MOF derived composites. Specifically, we delve into present methodologies, challenges, and opportunities for creating MOF derived composites. The distinct advantages of composites derived from MOF are investigated within the context of electrochemical applications, encompassing a range of batteries, involving lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K)-ions. In conclusion, the review addresses the existing challenges and outlines the future prospects for MOFs in their journey towards commercialization within the energy storage field.
