A roadmap of MOFs derived porous carbon, oxides, chalcogenides, and phosphides of metals: Synthesis, properties, parameter modulation and their utilization as an electrode for Li/Na/K-ion batteries Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are extensively studied nanomaterials known for their advantageous properties, including good porosity and high surface area. MOFs have garnered significant attention for their role as templates in producing tailored MOF-derived nanomaterials in the realm of energy storage devices. These MOF-derived materials, encompassing metal oxide, porous carbon, and metal oxide@C composites, have exhibited outstanding performance in energy storage devices. While the application of MOFs in deriving phosphides, sulfides and selenides has gained interest, it remains an area with untapped potential. This review provides a comprehensive overview of MOF's evolution from their pristine form to highly functionalized MOF derived composites. Specifically, we delve into present methodologies, challenges, and opportunities for creating MOF derived composites. The distinct advantages of composites derived from MOF are investigated within the context of electrochemical applications, encompassing a range of batteries, involving lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K)-ions. In conclusion, the review addresses the existing challenges and outlines the future prospects for MOFs in their journey towards commercialization within the energy storage field.
