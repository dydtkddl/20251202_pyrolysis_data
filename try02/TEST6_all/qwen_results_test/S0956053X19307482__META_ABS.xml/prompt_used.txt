You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste over zeolite- and sodium-based catalysts for enhanced yields of hydrocarbon products Ex-situ co-pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse pith and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was investigated over zeolite-based catalysts using a tandem micro-reactor at an optimised temperature of 700 °C. A combination of zeolite (HZSM-5) and sodium carbonate/gamma-alumina served as effective catalysts for 18% more oxygen removal than HZSM-5 alone. The combined catalysts led to improved yields of aromatic (8.7%) and olefinic (6.9%) compounds. Carbon yields of 20.3% total aromatics, 18.3% BTXE (benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene), 17% olefins, and 7% phenols were achieved under optimal conditions of 700 °C, a pith (biomass) to PET ratio of 4 and an HZSM-5 to sodium carbonate/gamma-alumina ratio of 5. The catalytic presence of sodium prevented coke formation, which has been a major cause of deactivation of zeolite catalysts during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics. This finding indicates that the catalyst combination as well as biomass/plastic mixtures used in this work can lead to both high yields of valuable aromatic chemicals and potentially, extended catalyst life time.
