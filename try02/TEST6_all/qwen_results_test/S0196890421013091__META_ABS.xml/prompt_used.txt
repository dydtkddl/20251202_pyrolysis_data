You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in photocatalytic carbon-based materials for enhanced water splitting under visible-light irradiation Hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting under visible-light irradiation is an appealing approach to generate clean and economical renewable energy resources. The key challenge in this field of research is to design and engineer cost-effective, green, and efficient photocatalysts. Recently, carbon-based photocatalysts have attracted huge interest for visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution reactions due to their high chemical stability, excellent electrical conductivity, and tunable surface characteristics. Here, a critical review on how various carbon-based materials such as carbon nitride, conjugated polymers, metal-organic frameworks, functionalized carbon quantum dots, and graphene derivatives emerged as next-generation photocatalysts for hydrogen production in the last five years is provided. We also highlight how the size-modulation and functionalization of nano-carbon-based materials with active species can lead to improved photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the potential of carbon dots and graphene-derivatives as noble metal-free co-catalysts and solid electron mediators in hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light illumination is discussed. The review finally elaborates the research gap and future perspectives, paving the way for new research to develop efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production.
