You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reactive extrusion of vitrimers: A short review Vitrimers are dynamic covalent polymer networks that combine the mechanical robustness of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics. Their unique associative bond exchange mechanism enables thermal malleability and stress relaxation while preserving network integrity, offering a promising route toward sustainable, high-performance materials. However, scalable processing of vitrimers remains a key challenge. Reactive extrusion (REX), a continuous, solvent-free method commonly used in polymer manufacturing, has emerged as a powerful technique to synthesize and reprocess vitrimers. This review highlights recent advancements in integrating vitrimer chemistry with reactive extrusion, focusing on diverse dynamic bond systems including trans-esterification, dioxaborolane metathesis, disulfide exchange, silyl ether exchange, and vinylogous urethane exchange. We explore the compatibility of these systems with REX in various polymer matrices ranging from polyesters and polyolefins to bio-based networks and discuss how parameters such as crosslink density, catalyst use, and phase behavior influence processability and material performance. Despite challenges such as limited residence time, degradation risks, and incomplete curing, emerging strategies like pre-vitrimer formation and tailored network design promise to overcome current limitations. By bridging polymer chemistry and process engineering, REX of vitrimers holds significant potential for enabling scalable, recyclable thermoset alternatives aligned with circular economy goals.
