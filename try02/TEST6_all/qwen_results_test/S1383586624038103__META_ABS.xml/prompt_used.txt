You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Elucidating synergistic effects and environmental value enhancement in infrared-Assisted Co-Pyrolysis of coal and polyvinyl chloride Co-pyrolysis of high-alkali coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) through infrared heating is a promising approach for managing escalating PVC waste and converting low-grade coal resources efficiently. The synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis and thermal degradation of PVC were studied through thermogravimetric analysis (TG-FTIR) and spectral analysis. Furthermore, chlorine migration and chemical transformation integral to the process, along with catalytic interactions, were explored through chlorine mass balance assessment, employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ion chromatography to establish a groundbreaking understanding of these phenomena. The results of products exhibited a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing with increasing temperatures and mixing ratios. The maximum oil yield was 14.62 %, achieving at 600 °C and 20 %. Meanwhile, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons remained high level through the synergistic interaction of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, nearly exceeding 60 %. The results showed that the Artificial Neural Network model had a high prediction accuracy with an R2 value of 0.99, while the decarboxylation effect dissociated the metal, resulting in an increase in the fixation of inorganic chlorine from 1 % to 66 % and a decrease in the chlorine content in the liquid phase. Innovatively, the study employs an ANN model for predicting the behavior of co-pyrolysis, exemplifying high accuracy in understanding complex thermal conversions of PVC and coal. Notably, the work challenges existing constraints by applying sophisticated analytical methods to elucidate the thermodynamics and kinetics of the co-pyrolysis processes, thereby enhancing the energetic and environmental value of the products.
