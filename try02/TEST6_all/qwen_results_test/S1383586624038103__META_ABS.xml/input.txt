Elucidating synergistic effects and environmental value enhancement in infrared-Assisted Co-Pyrolysis of coal and polyvinyl chloride Co-pyrolysis of high-alkali coal and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) through infrared heating is a promising approach for managing escalating PVC waste and converting low-grade coal resources efficiently. The synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis and thermal degradation of PVC were studied through thermogravimetric analysis (TG-FTIR) and spectral analysis. Furthermore, chlorine migration and chemical transformation integral to the process, along with catalytic interactions, were explored through chlorine mass balance assessment, employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ion chromatography to establish a groundbreaking understanding of these phenomena. The results of products exhibited a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing with increasing temperatures and mixing ratios. The maximum oil yield was 14.62 %, achieving at 600 °C and 20 %. Meanwhile, the content of aromatic hydrocarbons remained high level through the synergistic interaction of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, nearly exceeding 60 %. The results showed that the Artificial Neural Network model had a high prediction accuracy with an R2 value of 0.99, while the decarboxylation effect dissociated the metal, resulting in an increase in the fixation of inorganic chlorine from 1 % to 66 % and a decrease in the chlorine content in the liquid phase. Innovatively, the study employs an ANN model for predicting the behavior of co-pyrolysis, exemplifying high accuracy in understanding complex thermal conversions of PVC and coal. Notably, the work challenges existing constraints by applying sophisticated analytical methods to elucidate the thermodynamics and kinetics of the co-pyrolysis processes, thereby enhancing the energetic and environmental value of the products.
