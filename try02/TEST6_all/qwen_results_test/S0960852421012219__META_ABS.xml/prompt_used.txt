You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Third-generation L-Lactic acid production by the microwave-assisted hydrolysis of red macroalgae Eucheuma denticulatum extract The development of an efficient third-generation L-lactic acid (L-LA) production process from Eucheuma denticulatum extract (EDE) was achieved in this study. Microwave-assisted dilute acid hydrolysis (MADAH) and microwave-assisted hydrothermal hydrolysis (MAHTH) were chosen as the hydrolysis of EDE for the objective of increasing galactose yield. Single-factor optimization of hydrolysis of the EDE was studied, MADAH had high performance in galactose production relative to MAHTH, in which the yield and optimal conditions for both processes were 50.7% (0.1 M H2SO4, 120 °C for 25 min) and 47.8% (0 M H2SO4,160 °C for 35 min), respectively. For fermentation, the optimal L-LA yield was achieved at the inoculum cell density of 4% (w/w) Bacillus coagulans ATCC 7050 with 89.4% and 6% (w/w) Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14 with 87.6%. In addition, lipid-extracted Chlorella vulgaris residues (CVRs) as co-nutrient supplementation increased the relative abundance of B. coagulans ATCC 7050, thus benefiting L-LA production.
