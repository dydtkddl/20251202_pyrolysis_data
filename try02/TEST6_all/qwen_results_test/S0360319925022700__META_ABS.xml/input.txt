Performance and techno-economic analysis of a low carbon emission poly-generation system integrating solar-aided molten methane pyrolysis with chemical looping combustion To diversify solar energy utilization and save fossil fuel, a high-efficiency hydrogen, solid carbon, and power poly-generation system with near-zero greenhouse gas emissions is developed in this article. The proposed process consists of solar-aided methane pyrolysis system, and chemical looping combustion system (CLC). The total exergy efficiency of the suggested system is 2–9 % greater than that of the reference systems when compared to pyrolysis system integrated with CLC technology and solar-heated pyrolysis technology. Notably, this technology absorbs 99.85 % of CO2 emissions and reduces fuel energy usage by 43.34 %, resulting in a low CO2 emission of 0.02 kg/kg H2. The novel system is the most cost-efficient option, with a levelized hydrogen cost of 1.41$/kg H2. The effect of direct normal irradiation(DNI) on four typical days is evaluated, and the lower DNI situation is considered. These analyses demonstrate the potential of this system in achieving superior techno-economic performance and environmental impact.
