Solar full spectrum management in low and medium temperature light-driven chemical hydrogen synthesis - A review Solar-driven chemical hydrogen synthesis presents a promising solution for developing sustainable energy resources and controlling global carbon emissions. Despite significant efforts being dedicated to full spectrum utilization of solar energy, several vital factors limit efficient solar-chemical conversion. This research focuses on reviewing the progress and applications of the full solar spectrum utilization in the chemical synthesis of clean hydrogen at mid-and-low temperature solar heat. Detailed discussions are provided on fundamental mechanisms, design criteria, and spectrum management. Additionally, besides emphasizing the importance of the catalyst material in absorbing a broad spectrum, efficient solar-hydrogen conversion can be achieved through a series of spectral integration methods and energy cascade utilization technologies. Three strategies, including spectrum expansion, spectrum enhancement, and spectrum assignment, are analyzed, and their respective advantages, as well as the application progress in solar photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, and photoelectric catalysis, are discussed. According to these strategies, the efficiency of chemical hydrogen synthesis can be improved, and the comprehensive performance of the solar spectrum utilization system can be optimized to realize a cost-effective mid-and-low temperature solar hydrogen production process.
