You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solar full spectrum management in low and medium temperature light-driven chemical hydrogen synthesis - A review Solar-driven chemical hydrogen synthesis presents a promising solution for developing sustainable energy resources and controlling global carbon emissions. Despite significant efforts being dedicated to full spectrum utilization of solar energy, several vital factors limit efficient solar-chemical conversion. This research focuses on reviewing the progress and applications of the full solar spectrum utilization in the chemical synthesis of clean hydrogen at mid-and-low temperature solar heat. Detailed discussions are provided on fundamental mechanisms, design criteria, and spectrum management. Additionally, besides emphasizing the importance of the catalyst material in absorbing a broad spectrum, efficient solar-hydrogen conversion can be achieved through a series of spectral integration methods and energy cascade utilization technologies. Three strategies, including spectrum expansion, spectrum enhancement, and spectrum assignment, are analyzed, and their respective advantages, as well as the application progress in solar photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, and photoelectric catalysis, are discussed. According to these strategies, the efficiency of chemical hydrogen synthesis can be improved, and the comprehensive performance of the solar spectrum utilization system can be optimized to realize a cost-effective mid-and-low temperature solar hydrogen production process.
