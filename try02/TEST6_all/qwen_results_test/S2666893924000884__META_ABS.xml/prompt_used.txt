You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Industrial byproduct pine nut skin factorial design optimization for production of subcritical water extracts rich in pectic polysaccharides, xyloglucans, and phenolic compounds by microwave extraction Pine nut skin (Pinus pinea L.) is a poorly explored industrial byproduct with potential to be utilized as a food ingredient. Subcritical water extraction (SWE), an eco-friendly extraction technique with higher efficiency than hot-water extraction (HWE), was studied to evaluate its suitability in producing extracts rich in soluble fiber and phenolic compounds. For this, a factorial design was developed considering temperature (120–180 °C), time (2–10 min), and mass/volume ratio (1–3 g/60 mL) under microwave irradiation. This design aimed to maximize the extraction of carbohydrates, while achieving the highest content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. SWE produced higher yields (2.6-fold in relation to HWE) of extracts rich in polysaccharides, determined by methylation analysis, oligosaccharides, determined by GC-qMS as alditol acetates, and phenolic compounds, determined by HPLC-ESI-MS. SWE increased the recovery of pectic oligosaccharides (10-fold) and xyloglucans (2-fold), and allowed to recover pectic polysaccharides, type II arabinogalactans and insoluble-bound phenolic compounds. Mono-, oligo- and polysaccharides were not hydrolyzed during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, showing potential prebiotic functionality. Although phenolic compounds suffered a 23 % (gallic acid equivalents) decrease, phenolic acids and aldehydes were released or conserved upon intestinal phase. These results highlight the potential of PNS valorization as functional food ingredients through the subcritical water solubilization of polysaccharides and phenolic compounds.
