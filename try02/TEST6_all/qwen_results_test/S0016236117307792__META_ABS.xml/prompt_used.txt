You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass fast pyrolysis in a drop tube reactor for bio oil production: Experiments and modeling Woody biomass fast pyrolysis in Entrained Flow Reactor (EFR) is studied both with experiments in a lab-scale drop tube reactor (DTR) and simulations with a 1-D model. The parameters of the study are temperature (450–600°C), woody biomass particle size (370–640µm) and gas residence time (12.6–20.6s). The most critical phenomena affecting the bio-oil yield are considered in the model: heating of the biomass particles, slip velocity of the biomass particles varying with biomass/char properties, biomass pyrolysis and tar cracking. The analyses of all products – char, bio-oil and gas – also brought information on the advancement of the pyrolysis and cracking for the different tests. The reactor temperature and particle size were found to have a major influence on the pyrolysis product distribution. The production of bio-oil reaches a maximum of 62.4wt.% at 500°C for the 370µm particles. The particle conversion advancement is then estimated at 94% at the reactor exit. The bio-oil yield is lower at higher temperatures for a constant particle size due to tar cracking. At 550°C, increasing the particle size from 370µm to 640µm induces a decrease of the bio-oil yield from 48.3 to 34.8 wt.%, which was shown to be due to incomplete pyrolysis of the particles, because of a too short residence time as well as a too long heating time of particles. The pyrolysis conditions – temperature, particle size – were not found to have any significant influence on the bio-oil properties, such as acidity.
