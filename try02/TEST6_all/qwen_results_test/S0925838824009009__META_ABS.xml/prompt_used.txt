You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A universal synthesis strategy for facile and scalable of magnetic biochar composite materials for PMS activation: Catalytic mechanisms Biochar-based catalysts have shown great promise for application in AOPs due to their wide source and good performance, while its development is limited by its complicated preparation process and large variation in performance. Herein, a series of magnetic biochar composites(Fe@NC-XX) based on different biomass (duckweed, shrimp shell, peanut shell, corncob, and pomelo peel) were fabricated via one-pot pyrolysis method. The removal of sulfadiazine (SDZ) by all materials reached more than 90% within 20 min. The characterization results indicated that the special structure of Fe encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was the main reason why this approach is not limited to specific biomass. Acts as a catalytic center, Fe catalyzes the formation of CNTs during annealing. Meanwhile, graphene sheets and carbon nanoparticles formed by melamine and biomass decomposition migrate to the nucleus surface to form a hollow structure of CNTs. In addition, the results of quenching experiments and ESR tests elucidated that surface-bound radicals accumulated on the surface of CNTs, which can remarkably boost the efficient removal of SDZ. Consequently, the synthetic strategy of Fe nanoparticles anchored in N-doped CNTs that are not selective for biomass provides a new pathway for a universal synthesis method of biochar-based catalysts.
