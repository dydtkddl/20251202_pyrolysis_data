You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing sustainability in PET glycolysis by closed-loop recycling Glycolysis is a mild process for the chemical recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), but still lacks efficiency due to high waste streams. The aim of this work therefore is to facilitate recycling of ethylene glycol (EG) reactant/solvent and homogeneously dissolved zinc acetate (ZnAc2) catalyst as well as dissolved product bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) in the water-free PET glycolysis process. Through a combined approach of re-dosing and washing we saved 48.6±0.5% of EG and 50.0±5.2% of ZnAc2. By incorporating the collection of evaporated EG during BHET drying/re-polymerization, additional 35% of EG could further be saved in each of the five duplicate runs. While applying an optimized washing procedure in the recycling experiments, an equilibrium PET conversion was consistently reached after 150min of reaction time. Furthermore, the overall process yield was maintained at 80.6±1.8% in the recycling runs and the waste stream generation was reduced to a minimum. This study highlights the viability and environmental advantages of internal recycling, paving the way for a more sustainable and cost-effective PET glycolysis process.
