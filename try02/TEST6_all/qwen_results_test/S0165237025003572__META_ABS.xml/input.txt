Comprehensive analysis of colored p-PVC using multifunctional Py-GC/MS: Insights into additives This study investigates colored plasticized polyvinyl chloride (p-PVC), a common yet unstable material in modern museum collections due to its complex composition and vulnerability to degradation. While transparent p-PVC has been well-studied, colored p-PVC, with its intricate formulation and various additives, remains underexplored. To address this, colored vinyl sheets from Kiki Kogelnik's Hangings (1968–1986) were analyzed using a multifunctional Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) approach. For the first time, a combination of Single-Shot (SS) Py-GC/MS, Double-Shot (DS) Py-GC/MS, Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA)-MS, and Heart-Cut EGA-GC/MS (with and without cryotrap) was applied, showcasing their respective strengths and limitations in identifying additives such as plasticizers, lubricants, and colorants. Additionally, Multi-Functional Splitless (MFS) sampler was employed, enabling the use of the SS Py-GC/MS with F-Splitless injection for high-sensitivity analysis of trace samples (∼1 µg, compared to ∼100 µg required in conventional Py-GC/MS methods). This study uncovered the complex composition of the vinyl sheets, identifying plasticizers (e.g. DEHP, DBP), lubricants (e.g. polydimethylsiloxane oil), flame retardants (e.g. TPhP), antioxidants (e.g. octocrylene), and pigments (e.g. β-naphthol), while confirming their high quality. Our findings show that DS Py-GC/MS is optimal for 100–200 µg samples, while Heart-Cut EGA-GC/MS excels with larger samples (>300 µg), particularly for colorants and lubricants. SS Py-GC/MS with F-Splitless injection is highly effective for small samples (<10 µg), though extended acquisition times may be needed for high-molecular-weight phthalates. These results provide valuable guidance for selecting the optimal Py-GC/MS method for p-PVC analysis in heritage science to obtain maximum information with minimal sample amount.
