You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Amorphous calcium carbonate in form of spherical nanosized particles and its application as fillers for polymers The synthesis of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) via a liquid precursor to give spherical particles with monodisperse distribution of diameters in the range of 0.4–1.2μm has been optimized to the level to obtain multigram yields per batch. The synthesis was achieved by precipitation of ACC from a strongly alkaline solution of calcium chloride (CaCl2) at ambient temperature using the hydrolysis of water soluble dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the internal source of CO2. As ACC produced by this novel method contains a small fraction of bound water a drying process, namely annealing at 200°C for 6h was developed. The water free powder was blended with conventional polyolefins (linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS)) in a melt extrusion process. Blending with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) as a model of a biomedically relevant polymer was also achieved. While a homogenous dispersion of the dried amorphous calcium carbonate (DACC) particles in the polymer composites was easily achieved, the interaction between the polymer continuous phase and particle surface seems to be rather weak. Consequently, the physical properties of the blends having volume fractions from 10 to 40% of the filler behave as expected for non-interacting materials, e.g. the melt viscosity increases as predicted from Einstein's law, the glass transition and melting temperature of the polymer matrices remain largely unaffected. The Young's modulus did increase while tensile strength and elongation at break decrease.
