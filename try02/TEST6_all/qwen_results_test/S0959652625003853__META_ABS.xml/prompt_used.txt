You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Feasibility study of renewable recycled carbon fuel production via plastic waste pyrolysis Plastic solid waste (PSW) poses a major environmental issue because of its persistence and accumulation worldwide. This study examines a large-scale pyrolysis plant simulation that handles real PSW, focusing on a short supply chain. Data from experimental work supported detailed modeling, showing that the plant efficiently processes PSW with high energy and thermal efficiency. The plant is also capable of yielding renewable Recycled Carbon Fuels, meeting the latest European regulations (REDIII), which highlights its eco-friendly approach. Using the REDIII methodology makes the results clear and comparable, improving how similar technologies are assessed with respect to traditional Life Cycle Assessment methods. The greenhouse gas emissions from plastic waste treatment plants were evaluated using 1 MJ of gaseous fuel as the functional unit, emphasizing the impact of different plant configurations. Notably, the industrial scenario with the most efficient thermal and electrical integration system achieved emissions of 14.43 gCO2eq/MJFUEL and an 85% emission savings compared to fossil fuels, meeting the renewable RCF criteria set by REDIII. A techno-economic analysis found the plant to be a promising investment with a payback period of 6 years. The study also indicated how the fate of the solid residues from pyrolysis can affect both sustainability and profitability performances, potentially reducing the payback period by 1.3 years. This research suggests new ways to evaluate the economic impact of solid end-use, helping to build a foundation for more sustainable waste management practices.
