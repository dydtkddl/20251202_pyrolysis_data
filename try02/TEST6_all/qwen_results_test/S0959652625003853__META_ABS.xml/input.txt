Feasibility study of renewable recycled carbon fuel production via plastic waste pyrolysis Plastic solid waste (PSW) poses a major environmental issue because of its persistence and accumulation worldwide. This study examines a large-scale pyrolysis plant simulation that handles real PSW, focusing on a short supply chain. Data from experimental work supported detailed modeling, showing that the plant efficiently processes PSW with high energy and thermal efficiency. The plant is also capable of yielding renewable Recycled Carbon Fuels, meeting the latest European regulations (REDIII), which highlights its eco-friendly approach. Using the REDIII methodology makes the results clear and comparable, improving how similar technologies are assessed with respect to traditional Life Cycle Assessment methods. The greenhouse gas emissions from plastic waste treatment plants were evaluated using 1 MJ of gaseous fuel as the functional unit, emphasizing the impact of different plant configurations. Notably, the industrial scenario with the most efficient thermal and electrical integration system achieved emissions of 14.43 gCO2eq/MJFUEL and an 85% emission savings compared to fossil fuels, meeting the renewable RCF criteria set by REDIII. A techno-economic analysis found the plant to be a promising investment with a payback period of 6 years. The study also indicated how the fate of the solid residues from pyrolysis can affect both sustainability and profitability performances, potentially reducing the payback period by 1.3 years. This research suggests new ways to evaluate the economic impact of solid end-use, helping to build a foundation for more sustainable waste management practices.
