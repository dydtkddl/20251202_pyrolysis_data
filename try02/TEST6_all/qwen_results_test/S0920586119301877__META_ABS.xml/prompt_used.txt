You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-conversion of Kraft lignin and linear low-density polyethylene over mesoZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15 catalysts Catalytic co-conversion of Kraft lignin (KL) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) over mesostructured catalysts was examined using a micro-pyrolyzer equipped with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (MPy-GC/MS/FID). Mesoporous catalysts of Al-SBA-15 and mesoZSM-5 were synthesized and characterized by N2 sorption, ammonia temperature programmed desorption, and X-ray diffraction. The characterization results indicated that mesoZSM-5 had the smaller average pore size (4.10 nm) than Al-SBA-15 (10.70 nm), but its total acidity (both weak and strong acid sites) was much higher than Al-SBA-15. When they were applied as catalysts in the pyrolysis of KL and LLDPE, the mesoZSM-5 exhibited higher catalytic activity for aromatic hydrocarbon production due to its higher acidity and MFI pore structure. Indeed, synergistic synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons was achieved via the catalytic co-pyrolysis of KL and LLDPE because of the H-donating effect of LLDPE; the experimental yields (GC/MS area; abundance vs. time) of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oils obtained from catalytic co-pyrolysis of KL/LLDPE (1:1) over Al-SBA-15 (8.76 × 107) and mesoZSM-5 (27.58 × 107) were ∼1.5 fold higher than the theoretical yields.
