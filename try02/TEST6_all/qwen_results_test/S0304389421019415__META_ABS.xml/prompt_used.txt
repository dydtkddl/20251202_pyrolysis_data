You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transformation of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) into a versatile and efficient adsorbent of Cu(II) cations and Cr(VI) anions through hydrothermal treatment and sulfonation The reuse of waste polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has drawn much attention as it can reduce plastic waste and associated pollution, and provide valuable raw materials and products. In this study, sulfonated PVC-derived hydrochar (HS-PVC) was synthesized by two-stage hydrothermal treatment (HT) and sulfonation, and shown to be a versatile adsorbent. The removal of Cu(II) cations and Cr(VI) anions using HS-PVC reached 81.2 ± 1.6% and 60.3 ± 3.8%, respectively. The first stage of HT was crucial for the dichlorination of PVC and the formation of an aromatic structure. This stage guaranteed the introduction of -SO3H onto PVC-derived hydrochar through subsequent sulfonation. HT intensities (i.e., temperature and time) and sulfonation intensity strongly determined the adsorption capacity of HS-PVC. Competitive adsorption between Cu(II) and Cr(VI) onto HS-PVC was demonstrated by binary and preloading adsorption. The proposed Cu(II) cations adsorption mechanism was electrostatic adsorption, while Cr(VI) were possibly complexed by the phenolic -OH and reduced to Cr(III) cations by CC groups in HS-PVC. In addition, HS-PVC derived from PVC waste pipes performed better than PVC powder for Cu(II) and Cr(VI) removal (＞90%). This study provides an efficient method for recycling waste PVC and production of efficient adsorbents.
