You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of clean energy precursors from Bambara groundnut waste via pyrolysis: Kinetics, products distribution and optimisation using response surface methodology This study presents first comprehensive thermochemical analysis of Bambara groundnut shell. Pyrolysis characteristics was examined under non-isothermal degradation in nitrogen atmosphere at different heating rates (10, 15 and 20 °C/min) using single-step global model kinetic model. The single-step global model average apparent activation energy was found to be 142.64 ± 5.7 kJ/mol. Pyrolysis was conducted in a fixed bed reactor. Effects of pyrolysis temperature (450–750 °C), heating rate (20–50 °C/min) and nitrogen flow rate (5–25 L/min) were investigated collectively. The process variables were optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design. Optimum bio-oil yield of 36.49 wt% was recorded at 600 °C, 50 °C/min and 11 L/min. The bio-oil, bio-char and non-condensable gas collected were comprehensively characterised. Energy analysis of the products was also evaluated. This study revealed that Bambara groundnut shell, a residue from food crop, is a potential source of energy precursors for development of a sustainable bioenergy system and biomaterials.
