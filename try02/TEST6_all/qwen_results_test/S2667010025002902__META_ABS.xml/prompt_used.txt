You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lead (II) adsorption by KOH-modified rice straw biochar from battery wastewater: Adsorption optimization, isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic studies Lead (Pb(II)) contamination from battery manufacturing poses a major threat to aquatic systems in Uganda, necessitating cost-effective and sustainable treatment solutions. This study investigates KOH-modified rice straw biochar (KRSB) as an efficient and eco-friendly adsorbent for Pb(II) removal from battery wastewater. Rice straw was pyrolyzed to produce raw biochar (RSB) and subsequently activated with KOH. Both materials were characterised using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy coupled energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted and optimized using response surface methodology (RSM), considering adsorbent dosage, initial Pb(II) concentration, contact time, temperature, and pH as key variables. The optimal conditions, 0.8 g/L dosage, 121 mg/L Pb(II), 52 min contact time, 33°C, and pH 5.6, resulted in 85.1% Pb(II) removal from real battery wastewater. XRF and SEM–EDX analyses suggested ion exchange and surface complexation as dominant mechanisms, supported by FTIR evidence of oxygen-containing functional groups (–OH, –COO⁻). Adsorption followed the Langmuir–Temkin isotherms and pseudo-second-order kinetics, indicating chemisorption with a maximum capacity of 129 mg/g. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed that the process was spontaneous and endothermic. Although KRSB demonstrated strong potential for wastewater remediation, further studies on activation energy, co-ion interference, adsorbent regeneration, and scale-up are recommended.
