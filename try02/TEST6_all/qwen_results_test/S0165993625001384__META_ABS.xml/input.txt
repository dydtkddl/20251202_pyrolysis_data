Advances and challenges in the determination of micro- and nano-plastics by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry Global attention on micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) has increased due to their widespread presence and potential risks. Accurate detection of MNPs is critical for understanding their environmental fate, transformation processes, and potential toxicity. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) has emerged as a highly effective method for MNP detection, which has been applied to the identification and quantization of MNPs in different matrices, including atmosphere, aquatic environments, soils and sediments, organisms and human tissues. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the development, principles, and applications of Py-GC-MS in MNP research, highlighting its versatility and efficacy across different matrices. It also proposes current challenges in MNP quantification, such as strong destructive nature, limited injection volume, background interference, and the lack of standardized protocols. In conclusion, this review aims to understand the role of Py-GC-MS in advancing MNP research, thereby establishing the foundation for future research on the health risk of MNPs.
