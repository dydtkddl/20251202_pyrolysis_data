You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of gasification gas components on tar and ammonia decomposition over hot gas cleanup catalysts The tar and ammonia decomposition activities of dolomite, nickel catalyst, alumina and SiC were compared in different gas atmospheres. Tests were carried out in a fixed-bed tube reactor at 900°C under 2.0 and 5 MPa pressure. Toluene was used as a tar model compound. The gas atmospheres studied were mixtures of nitrogen carrier, toluene and ammonia with H2, H2O, CO, CO2, CO2 + H2O, H2 + H2O or CO + CO2. A gasification gas mixture containing all the components was also used. The predominant reaction of toluene in the empty tube and over SiC and alumina was hydrocracking. With dolomite and nickel catalyst, steam and CO2 reforming types of reaction took place at high rate, CO2 reforming being the faster. However, in gasification gas the rates of steam and CO2 reforming reactions were lowered due to the inhibiting effect of CO, CO2 and H2. Ammonia reacted readily with CO2 even with the inert reference materials and very rapidly over the nickel catalyst. The presence of toluene increased the ammonia reaction rate on the nickel catalyst. Ammonia decomposed in the gasification gas with the nickel catalyst at the same rate as in H2 + H2O-N2.
