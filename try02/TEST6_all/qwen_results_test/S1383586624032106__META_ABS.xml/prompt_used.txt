You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ manganese-aluminum-iron biochar derived from waste flocs for enhanced peroxymonosulfate oxidation: Role of Fe/Mn drives active species based on aluminum adsorption and synergistic promoted electron transfer Conventional coagulation or enhanced coagulation water treatment produced mass floc sludge, which contained plenty of metals and organic matter. Floc sludge disposal and resource recycling was vital relevance and urgently needed. Here, we reported on the waste flocs recycling through in-situ manganese-aluminum-iron biochar (MAFBC) synthesized via one-step pyrolysis using potassium permanganate (KMnO4) oxidation- aluminum-iron composite flocculant coagulation for humic acid removal floc sludge as raw material. Compared with ex-situ loaded or similar types of biochar, MAFBC showed faster and efficient activation effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade tetracycline (TC). TC was rapidly removed within 1 min in MAFBC/PMS system with degradation rate constant Kobs was 1.825 min−1, which mainly attributed to the multiple promoting effects of manganese-aluminum-iron. Aluminum oxides facilitated TC adsorption and synergistic Fe/Mn further significantly promoted electron transfer on the surface of the MAFBC. Additionally, bimetallic structure of Fe/Mn and the CO functional group on MAFBC accelerated the formation of reactive species. The redox cycles of Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+/Mn4+ promoted the formation of free radicals OH and SO4 −. Moreover, O2 – and 1O2 also assumed an important role for TC removal during active species evolution drived by Fe/Mn. This research provides a new perspective for in-situ design of economical and stable metal carbon-based water treatment activator, and make contributions to the utilization of waste flocs in water treatment.
