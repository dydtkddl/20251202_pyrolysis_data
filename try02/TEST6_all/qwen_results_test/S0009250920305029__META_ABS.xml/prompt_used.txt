You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and CFD investigation of inert bed materials effects in a high-temperature conical cavity-type reactor for continuous solar-driven steam gasification of biomass Solar biomass gasification was performed in a high-temperature conical bed reactor for thermochemical syngas production, which represents an efficient route to promote biomass valorization while storing intermittent solar energy into carbon–neutral solar fuels. The developed solar reactor is based on a conical cavity-type receiver enabling continuous biomass feedstock injection under real concentrated solar irradiation. In this study, the use of inert bed materials is considered to directly absorb a portion of the entering solar power and to transmit thermal energy to the gas and reactive particulate phase by radiation, convection and particle-to-particle interactions, with the aim of homogenizing the reactor temperature. A fluid dynamics study of the gas/particle flow was first performed to provide insights into the reactor hydrodynamics in the case of empty cavity and cavity containing inert particles in the forms of packed-bed and spouted-bed. The beneficial effect of the inert particles bed was emphasized. The spouted bed particles play a role in retaining the reacting biomass particles longer inside the reaction zone and promote phase mixing, as also confirmed by cold tests on a replicated transparent mockup cavity. Different inert particle bed materials were then considered and experimentally tested to unravel their impact on the biomass conversion, syngas composition and yield, and gasification performance in the solar-heated reactor operated at 1200 °C and 1300 °C.
