You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The thermochemical study of densified oil palm fronds char-based solid RE-fuel This research work studies the thermochemical properties of the densified char-based solid RE-fuel of oil palm fronds (OPF). The fuel properties of raw OPF and its char and pyrolysis liquid were determined for their suitability and sustainability on the production and further characterization of the densified char-based solid fuel. The OPF char and pyrolysis liquid, which work as the main source and binder, respectively are blended in the ratio mixture of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40 by using the hydraulic piston press machine under manual pressure of 10 MPa for at least 10 min. The results of the densifying process are showed that the weight percentage of 60:40 mixtures has the highest density value amounting to 0.8337 g/cm3, meanwhile, 90:10 mixtures possessed the lowest weight loss percentage which only around 2.58 % by its original weight input. As increases of binder portion in the mixtures, the energy value is reduced from 28.62 to 27.07 MJ/kg. The OPF char-pyrolysis liquid briquette mixture of 80:20 is considered as optimum densified solid fuel by providing good heat propagation with the low particulate matter emission released. The solid fuel has generated high-temperature propagation up to 180 °C and occupied low release of particulate matter emission almost the entire period of burning activity.
