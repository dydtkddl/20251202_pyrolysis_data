The thermochemical study of densified oil palm fronds char-based solid RE-fuel This research work studies the thermochemical properties of the densified char-based solid RE-fuel of oil palm fronds (OPF). The fuel properties of raw OPF and its char and pyrolysis liquid were determined for their suitability and sustainability on the production and further characterization of the densified char-based solid fuel. The OPF char and pyrolysis liquid, which work as the main source and binder, respectively are blended in the ratio mixture of 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, and 60:40 by using the hydraulic piston press machine under manual pressure of 10 MPa for at least 10 min. The results of the densifying process are showed that the weight percentage of 60:40 mixtures has the highest density value amounting to 0.8337 g/cm3, meanwhile, 90:10 mixtures possessed the lowest weight loss percentage which only around 2.58 % by its original weight input. As increases of binder portion in the mixtures, the energy value is reduced from 28.62 to 27.07 MJ/kg. The OPF char-pyrolysis liquid briquette mixture of 80:20 is considered as optimum densified solid fuel by providing good heat propagation with the low particulate matter emission released. The solid fuel has generated high-temperature propagation up to 180 °C and occupied low release of particulate matter emission almost the entire period of burning activity.
