You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of sustainable biocrude from Canadian agricultural biomass: Process optimization and product characterization The world's energy requirement is rising continuously due to an increase in the global population and demand for better quality of life. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, and their consumption poses global warming. Biomass-derived fuels are sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels as they are originated from renewable feedstocks. The present study investigates the production of biocrude from hydrothermal liquefaction of Canadian agricultural straws at identical conditions. Further, barley straw is found to be promising; therefore, hydrothermal liquefaction process parameters are varied for barley straw to maximize the biocrude yield with lower oxygen content. At optimum reaction conditions, the existence of carboxylic acids, phenols, aldehydes, and ketones is identified in the produced biocrude. Further, the recyclability study of the aqueous phase is attempted to explore the possibility of reusing this phase. The physicochemical characteristics of the biocrude (main product) and by-products (hydrochar, non-condensable gases, and aqueous phase) are also studied to identify the suitable areas of applications. The present experimental study demonstrates a detailed understanding of the liquefaction behavior of Canadian barley straw for biocrude production with an immense potential to co-refine in the existing petroleum refineries.
