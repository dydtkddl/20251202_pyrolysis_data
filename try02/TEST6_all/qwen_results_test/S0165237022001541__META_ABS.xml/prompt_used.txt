You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production from catalytic steam reforming of toluene over trace of Fe and Mn doping Ni/Attapulgite Tar formation has become the bottleneck of biomass gasification due to it serious impacts the gas quality and device safety. Catalytic steam reforming (CSR) is a potential technology that can utilize tar to produce hydrogen. In this work, a series of NixFeyMn/ATP (x, y = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 wt%) catalysts were successfully prepared by a sol-gel assisted impregnation method and applied to CSR of toluene, among which toluene was adopted as the biomass tar model. The characterization results of XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, HRTEM, H2-TPR, NH3/CO2/O2-TPD and XPS demonstrated that the addition of trace of Fe and Mn promoted the uniform dispersion of active Ni metal and increased the reducibility and enhanced CO2 adsorption ability of Ni-based catalysts. Among them, Ni0.5Fe0.5Mn/ATP catalyst exhibited the highest toluene conversion (99.2 %) and H2 yield (80.1 %) and superior stability. This attributes to it has the highest Ni0/Ni2+ proportion and the cooperative effect of electron transfer among the Ni, Fe and Mn components. Additionally, the spent catalysts are characterized by HRTEM, XRD, TG-DTG and Raman. It confirms that trace of Fe and Mn doping improved the catalytic stability is ascribed to the inhibition of amorphous carbon and the growth of carbon nanotubes does not affect the availability of active sites.
