You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of ubiquitous metal ions in degradation of microplastics in hot-compressed water Hydrothermal processing (HTP) is an efficient thermochemical technology to achieve sound treatment and resource recovery of sewage sludge (SS) in hot-compressed subcritical water. However, microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals can be problematic impurities for high-quality nutrients recovery from SS. This study initiated hydrothermal degradation of representative MPs (i.e., polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), polypropylene (PP)) under varied temperatures (180–300 °C) to understand the effect of four ubiquitous metal ions (i.e., Fe3+, Al3+, Cu2+, Zn2+) on MPs degradation. It was found that weight loss of all MPs in metallic reaction media was almost four times of that in water media, indicating the catalytic role of metal ions in HTP. Especially, PA degradation at 300 °C was promoted by Fe3+ and Al3+ with remarkable weight loss higher than 95% and 92%, respectively, which was ca. 160 °C lower than that in pyrolysis. Nevertheless, PE and PP were more recalcitrant polymers to be degraded under identical condition. Although higher temperature thermal hydrolysis reaction induced severe chain scission of polymers to reinforce degradation of MPs, Fe3+ and Al3+ ions demonstrated the most remarkable catalytic depolymerization of MPs via enhanced free radical dissociation rather than hydrolysis. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py GC–MS) was further complementarily applied with GC–MS to reveal HTP of MPs to secondary MPs and nanoplastics. This fundamental study highlights the crucial role of ubiquitous metal ions in MPs degradation in hot-compressed water. HTP could be an energy-efficient technology for effective treatment of MPs in SS with abundant Fe3+ and Al3+, which will benefit sustainable recovery of cleaner nutrients in hydrochar and value-added chemicals or monomers from MPs.
