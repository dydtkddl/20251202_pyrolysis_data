You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production and characterization of liquid oil from the pyrolysis of waste high-density polyethylene plastics using spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst Globally expanding plastic use has created environmental issues related to the disposal of plastic waste. One of the possible alternative techniques for turning waste plastics into high-quality liquid oils is thermal and catalytic pyrolysis. The research focused on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) thermal and catalytic slow pyrolysis employing waste fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst at various temperatures and catalyst-to-plastic ratios in a batch reactor. The ASTM methods and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of the produced liquid oil fraction. The results indicate that a pyrolysis temperature of 500°C and a catalyst to plastic ratio of 0.2 were the ideal operating conditions. The BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of the spent FCC catalyst were 0.103 cm2/g, 7.02 nm, and 63.24 m2/g, respectively. Waste HDPE plastic was thermally pyrolyzed, yielding 73.9 wt% liquid oil, 23.1 wt% gas, and 3 wt% char as the end products. Furthermore, the catalytic pyrolysis produced a higher yield of liquid oil (88.8 wt%) but less gas (9.9 wt%) and char (1.3 wt%). The kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, pour point, and calorific value of liquid oil produced by catalytic pyrolysis were 2.48 cSt, 0.85 g/cm3, 34.5 °C, -6 °C, and 41.6 MJ/kg, respectively. According to the GC-MS data, the liquid oil's chemical composition contains 38 hydrocarbons between C6 and C24. Because of this, the liquid oils made from waste HDPE have characteristics similar to those of conventional fuels and can be used as alternative renewable energy sources.
