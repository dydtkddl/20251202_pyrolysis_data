You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study of wood pellet and waste plastics oxy-combustion with oxygen staging in a fluidized bed reactor This study was the first to investigate the oxy-combustion of wood pellets and polyethylene (PE) combined with secondary oxygen injection. It began with fuel property analysis and thermogravimetric evaluation, including activation energy, combustion characteristics, and synergistic effects. Co-combustion experiments were conducted in a bubbling fluidized bed, examining parameters like fuel-blending ratio (BR), oxygen concentration, and secondary oxygen ratio (SOR). Synergistic effects between wood pellets and PE were observed in three stages: promotion from 240–400 °C, inhibition from 400–480 °C, and promotion from 480–560 °C. Activation energy analysis showed it rose with O2 concentration, except for PE. PE added to wood pellets caused tar coverage, delaying reactions and reducing combustion characteristic index. In fluidized bed experiments, higher O2 concentrations decreased temperatures in the lean phase, while higher SOR reduced temperatures in the dense phase. Increased oxygen levels raised NO emissions, but higher SOR extended gas residence time, reducing NO levels. While CO concentrations decreased with increasing O2 concentration, local sintering under 40 % O2 may lead to increased CO emissions. The highest exergy efficiency without secondary oxygen was achieved at 25 % O2/75 % CO2 and 40 % PE, reaching 55.67 %. Exergy efficiency improved with higher SOR, peaking at 60.1 % for 30 % O2/70 % CO2 under 30 % BR, and 30 % SOR conditions.
