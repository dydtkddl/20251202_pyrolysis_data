Efficient depolymerization of lactic acid oligomers into lactide with low racemization The depolymerization of lactic acid oligomers (LAOs) into lactide with low racemization is critical for the production of high-quality polylactide (PLA). This study explores the efficient depolymerization of LAOs into lactide with minimal racemization. A tetramethylammonium salt (TAS) catalyst was first employed to investigate the mechanism and pathway of lactide generation and racemization, confirming that the racemization was influenced by the catalyst anion following lactide generation. Based on the results, a novel catalytic system incorporated porous carbon and stannous octanoate was proposed to enhance the depolymerization process. Experimental results demonstrate that the addition of porous carbon significantly increases the crude yield and lactide content without inducing racemization. This is because the porous carbon effectively promotes the vaporization and separation of the produced lactide. A custom-built fixed-bed reactor was employed for continuous production, achieving a high yield of 98.88 % and a lactide content of 94.55 %. Meanwhile, this catalytic system enables continuous kilogram-scale production of low-racemization lactide. Compared to previous researches, this study resolves the conflict between efficiency, yield, conversion rate, and optical purity. As a result, this novel reaction system offers a powerful, stable, and applicable solution for the industrial production of high-quality lactide, which is also expected to promote the development of the PLA industry.
