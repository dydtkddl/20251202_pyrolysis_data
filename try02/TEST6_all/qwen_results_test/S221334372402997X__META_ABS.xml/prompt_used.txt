You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient depolymerization of lactic acid oligomers into lactide with low racemization The depolymerization of lactic acid oligomers (LAOs) into lactide with low racemization is critical for the production of high-quality polylactide (PLA). This study explores the efficient depolymerization of LAOs into lactide with minimal racemization. A tetramethylammonium salt (TAS) catalyst was first employed to investigate the mechanism and pathway of lactide generation and racemization, confirming that the racemization was influenced by the catalyst anion following lactide generation. Based on the results, a novel catalytic system incorporated porous carbon and stannous octanoate was proposed to enhance the depolymerization process. Experimental results demonstrate that the addition of porous carbon significantly increases the crude yield and lactide content without inducing racemization. This is because the porous carbon effectively promotes the vaporization and separation of the produced lactide. A custom-built fixed-bed reactor was employed for continuous production, achieving a high yield of 98.88 % and a lactide content of 94.55 %. Meanwhile, this catalytic system enables continuous kilogram-scale production of low-racemization lactide. Compared to previous researches, this study resolves the conflict between efficiency, yield, conversion rate, and optical purity. As a result, this novel reaction system offers a powerful, stable, and applicable solution for the industrial production of high-quality lactide, which is also expected to promote the development of the PLA industry.
