You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isothermal pyrolysis and gasification characteristics and gas products of ethylene vinyl acetate and back sheets in end-of-life photovoltaic module thermal treatment recovery Removing the back sheets (TPT, Tedlar / Polyethylene terephthalate / Tedlar) and encapsulants (EVA, ethylene vinyl acetate) through pyrolysis is a promising method for the efficient recycling of photovoltaic cells. A self-developed isothermal thermogravimetric analyzer was used to study the TPT and EVA pyrolysis characteristics as well as their gas products. Based on the release behavior of the gas products, a novel release pathway for CO2 during EVA pyrolysis was proposed. EVA pyrolysis with no residue at 450 °C in the 20 % O2 atmosphere within 30 min, making it possible to recycle PV materials with low energy consumption. TPT showed a two-stage characteristic in 20 % O2 and the residual from the first stage of TPT pyrolysis was able to be oxidized in the second reaction stage. The main gas products generated by the isothermal pyrolysis of EVA were CO2, C3H6, and CH4. Reusing the gas products was worthwhile since their lower calorific value reached 57.60 MJ/Nm3. The primary gas products of TPT pyrolysis were CO2, CH4, and C2H4. Different from temperature programmed pyrolysis, part of the acetyl groups in EVA formed CO2 directly but not acetic acid at high temperatures, and the CO2 release continued the whole isothermal pyrolysis.
