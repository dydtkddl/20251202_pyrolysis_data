You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquid organic hydrogen carrier hydrogenation–dehydrogenation: From ab initio catalysis to reaction micro-kinetics modelling The continued selective focus on the exploitation of fossil fuel chemicals as one of the main environment-depleting sources of energy is one of the reasons for the carbon dioxide emissions, severe air pollution and market crisis of today. The related easy transition to efficient renewable resources also brings challenges, such as the storing of performance generated year round. Consistent application option is to convert the formed transferred electricity produced into the hydrogen through electrolysis, store gaseous H2, and reversibly proceed with reforming or cracking. This routine way is also referred to in literature as evolving green H2. A relatively new method of storage is liquid organic carriers (LOHCs). These are molecules that are in a (l) state at room temperature measurements, contain unsaturated covalent bonds, and can be hydrogenated/dehydrogenated in the many loading cycles without catalytic decomposition products. Paper presents possible structure systems that have been previously investigated as an alternative to conventional. The process of catalysis, reduction and coking, catalysts, and the most commonly used elementary groups, interactions, and reaction condition analyses are listed, while an overview of studies that have assessed technical transfer phenomena is also provided. Reports, dealing with derived micro-kinetic modelling/computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is a direction for further research activities, are few. As for multiscale, review ranges from the density functional theory (DFT) to CFD. The review paper also addresses the latest studies on LOHCs in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The progress within the area with approaches is highlighted. Mesoscale surface–selectivity relationships, the robustness towards deactivation and techno-economics are dominant in linking the digital twin design to operation.
