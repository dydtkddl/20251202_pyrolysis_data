You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simultaneous H2 production and dechlorination in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves pyrolysis process with catalysts derived from electroplating sludge Concentrating and extracting functional substances from bulk solid waste and applying them to clean energy conversion is in line with the environmental concept of treating waste with waste. In this study, two catalysts, Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and Nano-NiO/CaO, were prepared by extracting metal elements from electroplating sludge (ES), and the promotional effects of the two catalysts on the H2 yield and HCl removal efficiency in the pyrolysis process of polyvinyl chloride gloves (PVC-G) were investigated. The results showed that under the optimal experimental conditions, In the presence of Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and Nano-NiO/CaO, the H2 production rates were up to 35.18% and 42.18%, respectively, and the enhancement efficiencies for H2 was as high as 173.56% and 228.01%, compared to the H2 production rate without catalyst involvement. Meanwhile, the removal of HCl from pyrolysis syngas by catalysts Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and nano-NiO/CaO was maintained between 80-85%. And there was no significant decreasing trend in cycling performance test.
