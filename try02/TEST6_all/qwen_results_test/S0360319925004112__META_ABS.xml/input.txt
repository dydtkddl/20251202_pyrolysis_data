Simultaneous H2 production and dechlorination in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves pyrolysis process with catalysts derived from electroplating sludge Concentrating and extracting functional substances from bulk solid waste and applying them to clean energy conversion is in line with the environmental concept of treating waste with waste. In this study, two catalysts, Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and Nano-NiO/CaO, were prepared by extracting metal elements from electroplating sludge (ES), and the promotional effects of the two catalysts on the H2 yield and HCl removal efficiency in the pyrolysis process of polyvinyl chloride gloves (PVC-G) were investigated. The results showed that under the optimal experimental conditions, In the presence of Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and Nano-NiO/CaO, the H2 production rates were up to 35.18% and 42.18%, respectively, and the enhancement efficiencies for H2 was as high as 173.56% and 228.01%, compared to the H2 production rate without catalyst involvement. Meanwhile, the removal of HCl from pyrolysis syngas by catalysts Nano-Fe2O3/CuO and nano-NiO/CaO was maintained between 80-85%. And there was no significant decreasing trend in cycling performance test.
