You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evidence for a chromasiloxane ring size effect in Phillips (Cr/SiO2) polymerization catalysts The ambient temperature reaction of CrO2Cl2 with silica, followed by mild heating to induce formation of uniform grafted silylchromate diesters, was studied as a function of the silica pretreatment temperature. The reactivity of the resulting chromate sites toward ethylene is qualitatively different: those formed on the silica pretreated at 200 °C are incapable of initiating polymerization, while those formed on silicas pretreated at 450 and 800 °C spontaneously induce polymerization with kinetic profiles closely resembling that of the calcined Phillips catalyst (CrO x /SiO2). Comparison of their X-ray absorption spectra suggests subtle differences in the chromate–support interactions, which can be interpreted in terms of changes in the chromasiloxane ring size distribution. The unstrained sites favored on the highly hydroxylated silica surface are consistent with 8-membered chromasiloxane rings formed by attachment of the CrO2 fragment to non-vicinal hydroxyls, while the strained sites on highly dehydroxylated silica surfaces are suggested to be 6-membered chromasiloxane rings created from vicinal hydroxyls located on adjacent silicon atoms. Simple computational models for these sites predict changes in the vibrational spectra and the XANES that are consistent with experimental observations.
