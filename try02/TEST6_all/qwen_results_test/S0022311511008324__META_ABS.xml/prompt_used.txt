You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Studies of (Cs,Ba)-hollandite dissolution under gamma irradiation at 95°C and at pH 2.5, 4.4 and 8.6 In the frame of the former French 1991-law on waste management, which was extended in 2006-law, hollandite ceramic was studied as a potential specific conditioning matrix for caesium isotopes (long-life radionuclide 135Cs and the strong heat generating radionuclide 137Cs). In this general study of Cs-containment in a ceramic matrix, the chemical durability was pointed out as a key property. Leaching experiments in static mode were conducted during 240days at various pH-values from acidic to alkaline range. The initial leaching rates between 0 and 45days are faster for Cs than for Ba and the average for the caesium are (1.4±0.1)×10−4 g/m2/d (pH 2.5), (6.4±0.9)×10−5 g/m2/d (pH 4.4) and (3.1±0.6)×10−5 g/m2/d (pH 8.6), and for the barium (6±1)×10−5 g/m2/d (pH 2.5), (2.8±0.3)×10−5 g/m2/d (pH 4.4), and (2±2)×10−6 g/m2/d (pH 8.6). At the equilibrium between 45 and 240days, the normalised mass losses average for caesium are (8.2±0.3)×10−3 g/m2 (pH 2.5), (5.2±0.4)×10−3 g/m2 (pH 4.4) and (4.1±0.2)×10−3 g/m2 (pH 8.6), and for barium (3.7±0.4)×10−3 g/m2 (pH 2.5), (2.0±0.1)×10−3 g/m2 (pH 4.4) and (4±2)×10−4 g/m2 (pH 8.6). Caesium and barium are incongruently released in solution with a correlation slope close to 0.5 at pH 2.5 and pH 4.4 and very low (near 0.02) in alkaline solution. Sorption experiments with radioactive isotopes (137Cs and 133Ba) were conducted on hollandite pre-leached in aqueous solutions. Caesium and barium release is controlled by the surface reactions. Leaching experiments and isotopic addition experiments (137Cs- and 133Ba-radiotracer) indicate that caesium behaviour is independent on pH-values, whereas barium behaviour is strongly dependent. Additional experiments in the presence of gamma irradiation (60Co source) did not show any significant effect on hollandite leaching process.
