You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Immobilization of photocatalytic materials for (waste)water treatment using 3D printing technology – advances and challenges Photocatalysis has been considered a promising technology for the elimination of a wide range of pollutants in water. Various types of photocatalysts (i.e., homojunction, heterojunction, dual Z-scheme photocatalyst) have been developed in recent years to address the drawbacks of conventional photocatalysts, such as the large energy band gap and rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. However, there are still challenges in the design of photocatalytic reactors that limit their wider application for real (waste)water treatment, such as difficulties in their recovery and reuse from treated (waste)waters. 3D printing technologies have been introduced very recently for the immobilization of materials in novel photocatalytic reactor designs. The present review aims to summarize and discuss the advances and challenges in the application of various 3D printing technologies (i.e., stereolithography, inkjet printing, and direct ink writing) for the fabrication of stable photocatalytic materials for (waste)water treatment purposes. Furthermore, the limitations in the implementation of these technologies to design future generations of photocatalytic reactors have been critically discussed, and recommendations for future studies have been presented.
