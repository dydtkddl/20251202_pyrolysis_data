You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailoring the adsorption potential and selectivity of microporous carbon through a two-step chemical-thermal modification approach: insights into the prolonged breakthrough adsorption of volatile organic compounds in air A better knowledge of prolonged breakthroughs is vital for developing durable adsorbents. This knowledge helps us assess their capacity for ongoing pollutant removal and lasting efficiency in real-world situations. To enhance the VOC adsorption capacity of activated carbon (AC, denoted as 'A' in subsequent adsorbent names), this study introduces a two-step chemical–thermal modification: (i) functionalization with amine/sulfur (F) or amino/silane (L) groups and (ii) a subsequent nitrogen thermal treatment (T) at 250 °C for 2 h. The adsorption capabilities of the resulting adsorbents, named AFT and ALT, are evaluated for the simultaneous adsorption of formaldehyde (FA) and benzene (both at 10 Pa). The two-step chemical-thermal treatment promotes surface interactions, leading to enhanced diffusivity of gaseous aldehyde/aromatic VOCs onto AFT and ALT beds. AFT exhibits superior adsorption capacities for both FA and benzene in a binary phase (at the maximum feeding volume of 136 L), reaching 10.9 and 44.7 mg g−1, respectively. These values surpass those of pristine AC by factors of 4.58 and 1.07, respectively. Notably, AFT shows a significantly higher (616 times) adsorption affinity for benzene than for FA, while its selectivity coefficient for FA over benzene (αF/B= 0.05) is lower than that of ALT (αF/B= 0.263). Kinetic studies indicate that FA adsorption on AFT is governed primarily by surface interactions and pore diffusion, while benzene adsorption is controlled by physical surface/pore diffusion. Density functional theory calculations further confirm that thermal treatment promotes carbon flake splitting, which increases surface area and enhances VOC binding interactions. This study provides strategic guidelines for optimizing the adsorption performance of common AC products through multi-step treatment approaches.
