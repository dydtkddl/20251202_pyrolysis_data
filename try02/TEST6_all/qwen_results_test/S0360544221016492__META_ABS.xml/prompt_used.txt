You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prediction of three-phase product distribution and bio-oil heating value of biomass fast pyrolysis based on machine learning In this work, by mining the experimental data of fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in bubbling fluidized bed in previous literature, regression prediction models were established for three-phase product distribution and bio-oil heating value (HHV) based on gradient boosting, random forest, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron algorithms. Comprehensive feedstock characteristics and pyrolysis conditions were considered and compared as input features. Among the several algorithms, random forest is most suitable for the prediction of three-phase product yields and bio-oil HHV with the benefits of high accuracy and good generalization ability. Visual analysis of the model shows that pyrolysis temperature is the most critical factor affecting three-phase product distribution, while bio-oil HHV is more affected by the feedstock characteristics such as the contents of C and H. The highest yield and HHV of bio-oil is obtained at about 480 °C, suggesting 480 °C as the optimum pyrolysis temperature of fast pyrolysis of biomass in a bubbling fluidized bed. As for the feedstock characteristics, high contents of C and H and low content of O are favorable to the enhancement of bio-oil HHV, indicating the crucial importance of feedstock pretreatment such as torrefaction to the quality improvement of bio-oil.
