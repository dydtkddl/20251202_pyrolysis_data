You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PLA-PHB/cellulose based films: Mechanical, barrier and disintegration properties Nanocomposite films based on poly(lactic acid)-poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PLA-PHB) blends and synthesized cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) or surfactant modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), as bio-based reinforcement, were prepared by melt extrusion followed by film forming. The obtained nanocomposites are intended for short-term food packaging. Thus, the mechanical, optical, barrier and wettability properties were studied. Functionalized CNCs contribute to enhance the interfacial adhesion between PLA and PHB, leading to improved mechanical stiffness and increased film stretchability. The synergic effects of the PHB and CNCs on the PLA barrier properties were confirmed by increases in oxygen barrier properties and reductions in surface wettability of the nanocomposites. In addition, the measurements of the viscosity molecular weight for ternary systems showed practically no degradation of PLA and smaller degradation of PHB during processing due to nanocrystal presence. The disintegration process in composting conditions of PLA was delayed by the addition of PHB, while CNC speeded it up. PLA-PHB-CNCs formulations showed enhanced mechanical performance, improved water resistance, reduced oxygen and UV-light transmission, as well as appropriate disintegration in compost suggesting possible applications as packaging materials.
