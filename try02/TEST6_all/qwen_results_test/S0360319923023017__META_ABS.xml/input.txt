Recent advances in hydrogen production from biomass waste with a focus on pyrolysis and gasification Energy consumption was skyrocketing along with fast economic development as well as continuous global population growth. Furthermore, environmental concerns about greenhouse gas emissions were also increasing, which indicated that these issues could be resolved by the development and utilization of renewable and clean energy. Among many renewable kinds of energy, hydrogen was considered the cleanest generating water because it was the only combustion product, allowing for truly zero pollutant emissions. As a result, developing efficient hydrogen generation technologies that utilized biomass feedstock, and ensured clean energy produced with low-carbon emissions was critical in helping fight against global warming as well as obtain waste recovery. In this paper, recent investigation advances in the generation of hydrogen from biomass pyrolysis and gasification were comprehensively reviewed in this regard. Also, the most recent studies on biomass pyrolysis and gasification in the use of biomass waste to produce hydrogen, with an emphasis on technical problems, efficiency, and mechanism were summarized. Following that, challenges and opportunities were presented for enhancing the efficiencies of the process and the quality of the products, which was significant to obtain sustainable and green development. Importantly, even though several advances and innovations in generating hydrogen from biomass were made using existing technologies, more scientific advances were needed to make it economically competitive as well as environmentally friendly for industrial production on large scale. Overall, the entire article gives a consolidated overview of the optimal condition suggested for superior H2 yield, and %volume from various biomass.
