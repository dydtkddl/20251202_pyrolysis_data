You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in the development of synthetic oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion applications Continuously rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere has led to significant negative impacts on the environment which propelled research efforts to replace fossil fuel-based energy with clean energy sources. However, the reliance on fossil fuel as the main energy source is projected to stay for many years to come, and therefore developing cleaner pathways to utilize fossil fuels for energy generation is paramount. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) has emerged in recent years as a promising technology for CO2 capture in power plants and other CO2 intensive industries. A key cornerstone for CLC is the development of efficient oxygen carriers with high oxygen capacity, fast kinetics, cyclic stability, mechanical strength, and low cost. The research progress in this field is rapidly growing to tackle the major materials and operational challenges to advance the knowledge toward a commercial scale CLC application. This work provides an overview of the significant advancements achieved over the past seven years in the development of synthetic metal oxide-based oxygen carriers. A summary of key performance indicators used to evaluate oxygen carriers is presented in this study to enable for a systematic assessment of the oxygen carriers’ properties and performance. This work is focused on summarizing and critically reviewing the literature on the development of oxygen carriers such as Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, Co-based metal oxides and combined/mixed oxygen carriers in the past seven years. Studies of naturally occurring materials and waste materials used as oxygen carriers are excluded from this review which is mainly focused on synthetically prepared materials. Significant efforts were dedicated to investigating the role of the supports, synthesis methods, promotors, and other factors affecting the CLC performance of synthetic oxygen carriers using solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels. This review also outlines the main challenges, research needs and opportunities for future progress to highlight potential pathways to develop synthetic oxygen carriers in an environmentally friendly, and cost-effective manner.
