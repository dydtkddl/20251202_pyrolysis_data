Thermal degradation of various types of polylactides research. The effect of reduced graphite oxide on the composition of the PLA4042D pyrolysis products This study was aimed to investigate the effect of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the pyrolysis of polylactide composites (PLA4042D/rGO) prepared in solution. GC-MS analysis of PLA4042D/rGO pyrolysis products showed that introduction of rGO into the composition with PLA leads to a significant change in the ratio of main degradation products. A sharp decrease of five-membered dioxolanones accompanied by a growth in the content of lactides and cyclic oligomeric lactides was observed in PLA4042D/rGO pyrolysis products as compared with pristine PLA. DSC studies of PLA4042D crystallization in the melt showed that the adsorption of PLA macromolecules on rGO surface can cause the decrease in their segmental mobility. Apparently, a decrease in the segmental mobility of PLA chains hinders the formation of dioxolanones via the intramolecular nonradical ester interchange reaction. At the same time, the role of intermolecular reactions with the formation of cyclic oligomers of lactides increases.
