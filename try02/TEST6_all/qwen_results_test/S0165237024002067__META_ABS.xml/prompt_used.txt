You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in polyolefinic plastic pyrolysis to produce fuels and chemicals Plastic waste has become a major global concern, due to the widespread use of plastics, resulting in plastic waste accumulation in landfills, and poor plastic waste management that has caused discarded plastics to accumulate in oceans, worldwide. Pyrolysis, a thermochemical treatment technique, offers a sustainable and efficient solution by reducing pollution and recovering valuable energy and products. This paper provides an overview of existing pyrolysis techniques for plastic waste and discusses the parameters that influence product yield and selectivity. It explores the impact of different catalysts on the pyrolysis process and offers a comparative assessment with the conventional pyrolysis. By recovering plastic waste through pyrolysis, the dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels can be reduced, bolstering energy sustainability while mitigating plastic waste’s environmental repercussions. This paper also discusses the deactivation and regeneration mechanisms of the catalysts, as well as strategies to optimize liquid oil production from plastic waste, highlighting the potential for utilizing pyrolysis-derived liquid oil as a more sustainable energy source. Lastly, the paper includes a discussion on the future outlook of the pyrolysis industry. This review would provide recommendations for future research directions, enabling researchers and stakeholders to identify key areas of interest and develop new projects accordingly.
