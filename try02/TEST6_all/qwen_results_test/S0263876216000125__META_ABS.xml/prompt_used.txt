You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and modeling studies on the acid-catalyzed conversion of inulin to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in water Inulin is considered as an attractive feed for the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), an important biobased platform chemical with high application potential. We here report a systematic study to optimize the HMF yield from inulin in a batch reactor for reactions in water using sulphuric acid as the catalyst. The latter was selected on the basis of a screening study with seven organic- and inorganic Brönsted acids (H2SO4, HNO3, H3PO4, HCl, trifluoroacetic acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid). The effect of process conditions such as temperature (160–184°C), inulin loading (0.05–0.17g/mL), sulphuric acid concentration (0.001–0.01M) and reaction time (0–60min) on HMF and levulinic acid (LA) yields were determined experimentally and subsequently modeled using non-linear multivariable regression. The highest experimental HMF yield was 39.5wt% (50.6mol%) and was obtained at 170°C, an inulin loading of 0.17g/mL, a sulphuric acid concentration of 0.006M and a reaction time of 20min. Agreement between experiments and model for both HMF and LA yield was very satisfactorily.
