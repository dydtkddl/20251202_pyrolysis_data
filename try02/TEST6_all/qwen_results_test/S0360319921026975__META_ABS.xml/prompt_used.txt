You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of metal hydride hydrogen storage thermal management for use in the fuel cell systems Thermal management of metal hydride (MH) hydrogen storage systems is critically important to maintain the hydrogen absorption and release rates at desired levels. Implementing thermal management arrangements introduces challenges at system level mostly related to system's overall mass, volume, energy efficiency, complexity and maintenance, long-term durability, and cost. Low effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of the MH bed (~0.1–0.3 W/mK) is a well-known challenge for effective implementation of different thermal management techniques. This paper comprehensively reviews thermal management solutions for the MH hydrogen storage used in fuel cell systems by also focusing on heat transfer enhancement techniques and assessment of heat sources used for this purpose. The literature recommended that the ETC of the MH bed should be greater than 2 W/mK, and heat transfer coefficient with heating/cooling media should be in the range of 1000–1200 W/m2K to achieve desired MH's performance. Furthermore, alternative heat sources such as fuel cell heat recovery or capturing MH heat during charging and releasing it back during discharging have also been thoroughly reviewed here. Finally, this review paper highlights the gaps and suggests directions accordingly for future research on thermal management for MH systems.
