Techno-economic analysis of sawdust and rice husk co-pyrolysis for bio-oil production A techno-economic analysis of bio-oil production from co-pyrolysis of sawdust and rice husk blend was performed to assess the feasibility of scaling up the plant capacities. The analysis was conducted at plant capacities of 0.1 kg/h, 100 kg/h and 1000 kg/h in USD currency. Technology evaluation was based on an optimum bio-oil yield of 51.9 % and a blending ratio of sawdust to rice husk 50:50 using a fluidized bed reactor. Sensitivity analysis showed that operating labour costs, nitrogen costs and feedstock costs have a significant impact on the unit production cost of bio-oil. A plant capacity of 1000 kg/h appears to be more economical for bio-oil production at a nominal unit production cost of 0.052 USD/kg.
