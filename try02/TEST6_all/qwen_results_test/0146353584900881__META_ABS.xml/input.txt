Organometallics in crystal growth This review describes the use of organometallics in crystal growth — exemplified by the IV, III–V, and II–IV semiconductors. The review covers the mechanism, thermochemistry and thermodynamics of organometallic decomposition, growth methodology, oriented crystal growth and morphology, and potential device applications in the areas of solar cells and lasers.
