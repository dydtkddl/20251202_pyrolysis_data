You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailoring biobased aliphatic polyesters for high T g, scalable production, processability, biodegradability, and closed-loop chemical recyclability Fully bio-based spirocyclic monomers with high reactivity and thermal stability in polycondensations, and scalable production from low-cost reactants are attractive alternatives to replace fossil-based terephthalate monomers. To this end, we carefully design and synthesize a dicarboxylate ester monomer with a spiroacetal structure from bio-based pentaerythritol and glyoxylic acid. Polycondensations of the spiro-monomer with various potentially bio-based diols yield a family of fully amorphous and transparent film- and fiber-forming polyesters with M n = 15–23 kg mol−1 and glass transition temperatures between 27 and 127 °C. A 1,6-hexanediol-derived polyester film shows greatly improved oxygen barrier properties compared with commercial polyester materials. The ester bonds in the polyesters can be selectively cleaved under mildly acidic, or even neutral, catalyst-free methanolysis at 50 °C, while keeping the spiroacetal groups intact. We demonstrate that it is possible to conveniently and selectively depolymerize the polyesters by methanolysis, even in the presence of mixed plastic waste, followed by recovery and re-polymerization of the monomers to obtain chemically recycled polyesters with properties comparable to the original materials. Moreover, biochemical oxygen demand measurements show 59 % degradation of a selected polyester after 90 days at 50 °C in a composting environment, nearly 20 % higher than the PBAT control sample.
