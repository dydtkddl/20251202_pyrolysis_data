You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of polymers to fuels in a refinery stream The purpose of this study was to investigate the processability of LDPE, PP, PVC/LDPE and PVC/PP in the hydrocracking unit of a refinery. For this, LDPE or PP has been added to vacuum gas oil (VGO). The blends were hydrocracked over different catalysts using a batch autoclave at 425–450 °C under hydrogen atmosphere. The catalysts used were HZSM-5, Cobalt loaded active carbon (Co-Ac) and DHC-8 (commercial silica-alumina catalyst). Addition of polymer to VGO affected the cracking of VGO, leading to a decrease in the gas yield and an increase in the liquid yield. In hydrocracking over HZSM-5, the product distribution was similar for two blends. HZSM-5 gave higher gas yields than the other catalysts. When using Co-Ac and DHC-8 catalysts, the gas and liquid yields depend on the polymer type as well as temperature. In the case of the PVC-containing blends (PVC/PP/VGO or PVC/PE/VGO), the blends were firstly dechlorinated at 350 °C. Then the dechlorinated mixture was hydrocracked in the 400–450 °C range in the presence of DHC-8. HCl evolved by degradation of PVC during the dechlorination step partially degraded PE and PP and these predegraded polymers were more easily cracked in the hydrocracking step. In addition, we observed the effect of polyene formed from the PVC degradation residue on the thermal hydrocracking. The chlorine compounds in the hydrocracked feed affected the catalytic activity of the catalysts.
