You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct production of olefins from waste plastic using a pyrolysis and fluid catalytic cracking integrated process: Part 1. study on the production and analysis of waxy oil obtained using a new type of a fluidized bed reactor The ultimate aim of this research is to produce ethylene and propylene directly from waste plastic. To achieve this, we designed a new cracker having a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) and a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. The FBR produces oil in vapor phase, and the FCC unit transforms the vapor into olefins. As a first step toward achieving the research goal, the current study conducts pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene using a new pyrolysis process having a FBR. By understanding characteristics of pyrolysis oils obtained in this study, it becomes possible to determine its suitability as FCC feed and its relationship with olefin productivity. The current investigation focused on the effects of vapor residence time, reaction temperature, and type of fluidizing medium on yield and composition of oil. The results showed that the waxy oil yield depended highly on reaction temperature, reaching a maximum of about 95 wt%. The sum of yields of n-alkenes and n-alkadienes, which are favorable for producing olefins when catalytically cracked in the FCC unit, reached 82 wt%. SIMDIS analysis, which determines the boiling point range distribution of oil, revealed strong effects of reaction temperature and residence time on the carbon numbers of the waxy oil.
