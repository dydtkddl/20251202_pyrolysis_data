You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Concrete as low-cost catalyst to improve gas quality during biomass gasification in a pilot-scale gasifier Concrete was evaluated as low-cost catalyst for in-situ application in an autothermal 80 kWth pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed direct (air) biomass gasifier. To improve the understanding of the observed phenomena, the process was also evaluated in smaller-scale reactive system, namely an externally heated 3 kWth bench-scale bubbling fluidized bed. Concrete application showed promising results regarding the relative increase of H2 concentration and H2/CO molar ratio in the producer gas (up to 99.2 and 77.4%, respectively), indicating that this material can promote the water-gas shift reaction. However, this effect was dependent on the gas-solid contact time and catalyst temperature, being that it was only relevant when these parameters were at least 5.2 s and 746 °C, respectively. A maximum lower heating value of 7.5 MJ/Nm3 of the producer gas was found with concrete application (23.8% relative increase), which is higher than commonly found in the literature. Relative increases of up to 25.1, 55.3 and 47.0% for the specific dry gas production, cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion efficiency, respectively, were also found, consequently suggesting that, in addition to the promotion of the water-gas shift reaction, this material has potential to promote tar reforming/cracking and carbon gasification reactions.
