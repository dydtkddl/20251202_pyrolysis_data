You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling of low-density polyethylene and polypropylene via copyrolysis of polyalkene oil/waxes with naphtha: product distribution and coke formation The thermal decomposition of polyalkenes was investigated as a recycling route for the production of petrochemical feedstock. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were thermally decomposed individually in a batch reactor at 450°C, thus forming oil/wax products. Then these products were dissolved in primary heavy naphtha to obtain steam cracking feedstock. The selectivity and kinetics of copyrolysis for 10mass% solutions of oil/waxes from LDPE or PP with naphtha in the temperature range from 740 to 820°C at residence times from 0.09 to 0.54s were studied. The decomposition of polyalkene oil/waxes during copyrolysis was confirmed. It was shown that the yields of the desired alkenes (ethene, propene), according to polymer type, increased or only slightly decreased compared to the yields from naphtha. In addition to the primary reactions, the secondary reactions leading to coke formation have also been studied. The formation of coke during copyrolysis of LDPE wax with naphtha was comparable to the coking of pure naphtha. Slightly higher formation of coke was obtained at PP wax solution at the beginning of the measurements, on the clean surface of the reactor. After a thin layer of coke covered the walls, the production was the same as that from naphtha. The results confirm the possibility of polyalkenes recycling via the copyrolysis of polyalkene oils and waxes with conventional liquid steam cracking feedstocks on already existing industrial ethylene units.
