You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of heavy fractions from the pyrolysis of waste HDPE and PP In the present paper, automotive waste plastics were considered as a potential source of fuels and chemicals. The feedstock in the experimental tests was represented by the heaviest fractions from the distillation of pyro-oil from the pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE-wax) and polypropylene (PP-wax). Due to their very high viscosity both polymer-waxes were, prior to processing, diluted in atmospheric gas oil (GO). Mixtures with hydrotreated vacuum gas oil (HVGO) were also prepared and processed under simulated fluid catalytic cracking conditions via a MAT-test. The product distribution was similar to the one shown by the commercial FCC process: light gases (C1, C2), LPG, gasoline fraction, light and heavy cycle oil. To maintain optimal performance a commercial FCC equilibrium catalyst (FCC-ECAT) was used. When processing HDPE and PP waxes, high yields of profiling products – propylene and gasoline were obtained. In the case of the PP-wax feed without HVGO, the yield of gasoline was even higher than in case of pure HVGO. When cracking HDPE-wax feed mixtures the product distribution was oriented more towards the production of propylene. The composition of liquid products considering all types of feedstock consisted mainly of iso-alkanes and aromatics. The calculated values of microactivity for the HDPE-wax and PP-wax feedstock, with or without HVGO, were significantly higher than in the case of pure HVGO.
