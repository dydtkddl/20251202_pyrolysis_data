Synthesis and characterization of Sr1-xLaxMnO3/SiOC nanocomposites decorated with 1D nanostructures for high temperature CO2 splitting 1D nanostructures of Lanthanum Strontium Manganite (LSM) are tested as thermochemical catalyst for CO2 splitting. The manganite precursors were incorporated into a ceramic silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) matrix at two different stages during its synthesis to form the nanocomposites. As a result, the LSM nanostructures decorate the large-size pores of the SiOC matrix in form of 1D nanofibers and nanowires. At the same time, the formation of the SiOC units decreases because of the incorporation of these LSM. Moreover, the synthetic strategy strongly affects the surface parameter related to apolar interactions. It turns out that the surface fractal constant of the nanocomposite determines the reactivity of the LSM materials towards CO2. This reactivity has been verified by collecting the spectra of the gases involved in the thermochemical reactions and determining the relative CO2 concentration as a function of the temperature.
