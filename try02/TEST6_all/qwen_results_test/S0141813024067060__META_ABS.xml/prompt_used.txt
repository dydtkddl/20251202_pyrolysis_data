You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal fabrication of composite chitosan grafted salicylaldehyde/coal fly ash/algae for malachite green dye removal: A statistical optimization In this study, chitosan grafted salicylaldehyde/coal fly ash/algae (Chi-SL/CFA/Alg) was synthesized by assistance of hydrothermal process to be an effective adsorbent to remove cationic dye (malachite green: MG) from water. The physicochemical properties of the Chi-SL/CFA/Alg biomaterial were examined using SEM-EDX, pHpzc, specific surface area (BET), and FTIR analyses. The optimization process of the adsorption operation parameters for MG removal by Chi-SL/CFA/Alg were optimized using a Box-Behnken design (BBD). The selected adsorption operation parameters Chi-SL/CFA/Alg dosage (A: 0.02–0.1 g/100 mL), solution pH (B: 4–8), and contact time (C: 20–360 min). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to determine the significant interaction between the adsorption operation parameters and to validate BBD output. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms of MG dye by Chi-SL/CFA/Alg were well described by pseudo-second order (PSO) kinetic and Freundlich isotherm model respectively. Thus, the maximum adsorption capacity (q max) of MG dye by Chi-SL/CFA/Alg was found to be 493.7 mg/g at basic pH environment (pH = 8) and working temperature 25 °C. The adsorption mechanism can be ascribed to various interactions, including hydrogen bonding, π-π interactions, electrostatic attraction, and n-π interactions. Thus, Chi-SL/CFA/Alg can be considered as preferable and potential adsorbent for removing cationic dye from aqueous environment.
