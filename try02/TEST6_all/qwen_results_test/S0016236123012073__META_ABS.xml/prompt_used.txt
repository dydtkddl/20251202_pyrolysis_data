You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization and kinetic studies of 12-tungstophosphoric supported mesoporous aluminosilicate through response surface methodology for biodiesel production using green seed canola oil Biodiesel synthesis using a non-edible feedstock obtained from green seeds of canola oil using 12-tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid supported mesoporous aluminosilicate (HPW/MAS) catalyst was conducted. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) approach was implemented to study the effects of catalyst loading, methanol to oil (M/O) molar ratio, and reaction time on biodiesel yield. A polynomial quadratic model was developed as a suitable model to correlate the reaction parameters to the response. M/O molar ratio indicated the most effect on biodiesel yield owing to the reversible nature of this reaction, while catalyst loading had minor effect on it. The highest biodiesel yield of 89 % was obtained at optimum reaction conditions of 5.9 wt% of catalyst loading, 27.2 of M/O molar ratio, at 200 °C and 4 MPa for 8 h. The formation of biodiesel was verified using HPLC, NMR and GC–MS analyses for their functional groups corresponding to esters. Kinetic study was carried out with pseudo first order assumption at various reaction temperatures in the range of 160 to 200 °C. From the Arrhenius equation, the pre-exponential factor and activation energy were found to be 9.1 × 102 min−1 and 36.34 kJ/mol, respectively.
