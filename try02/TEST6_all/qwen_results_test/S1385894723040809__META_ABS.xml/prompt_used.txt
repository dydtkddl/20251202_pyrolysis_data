You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling plastic waste: Rapid aqueous depolymerization of PET and simultaneous growth of highly defective UiO-66 metal-organic framework with enhanced CO2 capture via one-pot synthesis UiO-66(Zr) MOF was synthesized rapidly via one-pot synthesis in an acidic aqueous media starting with waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic flakes and Zr metal salt. Complete depolymerization of PET into BDC (benzene dicarboxylic acid) linkers and coordination with Zr metal clusters occurred in 30 mins under microwave irradiation. PET-derived UiO-66 showed a large micron-sized cuboctahedron crystal structure with high microporosity. The use of acetic acid as a modulator helps to increase the reo -topology defect within the MOFs improving CO2 uptake. PET-derived UiO-66 exhibited intense reo -defects than UiO-66 synthesized using a pristine BDC linker. This was likely due to the one-pot reaction of PET depolymerization with simultaneous MOF growth that results in an enhanced competition of modulator and byproducts formed during PET digestion along with the BDC to bind with Zr clusters inducing more defects in the structure. Heat treatment of the PET-derived UiO-66 with the optimal mole ratio of 1Zr:1PET yields UiO-66 with the highest BET surface area of 1200 m2g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.57 cm3g−1. The highest CO2 uptake of 2.06 mmolg−1 was shown by 1Zr:1PET, due to their high microporosity and profound reo -structure which demonstrated superior CO2 uptake than the UiO-66 synthesized using commercial BDC. The selectivity of the CO2 over N2 was over 25.3 times and exhibited excellent regeneration stability and recyclability over 5 cycles with 99% of persistent CO2 sorption capacity. This study demonstrated the utilization and recycling of PET waste to BDC linkers with simultaneous MOF growth which have a high potential to capture CO2 effectively.
