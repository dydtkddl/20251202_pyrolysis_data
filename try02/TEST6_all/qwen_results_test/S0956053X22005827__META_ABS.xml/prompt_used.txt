You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste: Predicting the product yields The predictability of pyrolysis yields and product composition of mixed plastics has been studied. To do so, pyrolysis of virgin polymers (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS and PET) and eight individual sorting categories from a real waste DKR-350 stream (PE rigid/film, PP rigid/film, PET, PS, multilayer flexibles, and clogged materials) was performed in a batch reactor at 500 °C at laboratory scale. The obtained oil/wax, gas, and solid yields and the composition of oil/wax of those individual feedstocks were used as input of a superposition model to predict the corresponding pyrolysis yields and oil/wax composition of mixed feeds, which were later compared with the experimentally measured product yields from the pyrolysis of those mixed streams. This linear model predicts the oil/wax yield of the mixed streams to a reasonable extent, with a maximum yield deviation (overestimation) of 8 percentage points. However, the presence of significant amounts of PET (above 33 wt%) in the mixed plastic streams negatively impacts the production of the condensable product and promotes the formation of solid products beyond the expected predicted values. Quantification of the type of carbon (aliphatic, aromatic and carbonyl) present in all the oil/wax products was done using 13C NMR spectroscopy. A linear model could also predict the aliphatic carbon yield in the condensable product from plastic waste streams with high accuracy (maximum yield difference of 6 percentage points). However, the aromatic carbon yield could not be predicted, probably due to the observed behavior of PET, which interacts with other polymers to promote solid product formation.
