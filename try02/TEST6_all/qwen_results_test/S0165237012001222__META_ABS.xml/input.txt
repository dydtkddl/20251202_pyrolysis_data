Pyrolytic production of microporous charcoals from different wood resources A series of porous chars has been obtained by heat treatment of unconventional raw materials, including plants belonging to short rotation woody crops (Salix viminalis, Salix fragilis). The pyrolysis conditions (1–3h, 600–900°C) were the same for the production of all chars, e.g., mesoporous and microporous chars. Salix viminalis wood exhibited an advantage over the other materials, because the obtained material had microporous structure such as carbon molecular sieves. Similar properties (surface area, total pore volume, pore size distribution) were observed for charcoals produced from pine wood (Pinus silvestri), but the thermal stability of these properties was inferior. Furthermore, we have also discussed economical and environmental issues associated with the exploitation of wood resources.
