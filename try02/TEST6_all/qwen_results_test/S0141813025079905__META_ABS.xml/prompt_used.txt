You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication and evaluation of cellulose nanocrystal-activated carbon nanocomposites for industrial wastewater purification: Adsorption and modeling Development of cost-effective and eco-friendly technology for the removal of toxicants from industrial wastewater is undoubtedly a crucial issue. Currently, a huge amount of crude wastewater has been discharged from several types of large/medium-scale industries (like Textile), which could destroy the aquatic environment/public health. To solve this issue, numerous high-tech processes have been suggested for the effective fabrication of CNC-AC-based bionanosorbents that could be innovative, economical, and beneficial in water treatment technology. Additionally, some advanced characterization methods (i.e., XRD, NMR, FTIR, DSC, TGA, BET, FESEM, XPS, AFM, TEM, DLS, ZP, etc.) along with the application mode and synergistic mechanism regarding the elimination of various pollutants have also been offered for better understanding the significance and selectivity. This can be superior to others due to its lower cost, superior efficiency, ecological nature, and greater stability. Also, the designated precursors like biomass-derived CNC and AC would be more available, economical, and reveal outstanding physicochemical, thermomechanical, microstructural, and morphological properties that must boost the capacities (∼99 %) of the forthcoming CNC-AC biocomposites. This review will be dedicated to offering a robust database addressing the effective processing of precursors, high-tech fabrication, characterization, application, and synergistic mechanisms. By determining research gaps and proposing impending instructions, this paper also offers some mathematical models to predict the experimental BTC curve.
