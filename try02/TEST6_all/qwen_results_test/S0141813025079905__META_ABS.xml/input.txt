Fabrication and evaluation of cellulose nanocrystal-activated carbon nanocomposites for industrial wastewater purification: Adsorption and modeling Development of cost-effective and eco-friendly technology for the removal of toxicants from industrial wastewater is undoubtedly a crucial issue. Currently, a huge amount of crude wastewater has been discharged from several types of large/medium-scale industries (like Textile), which could destroy the aquatic environment/public health. To solve this issue, numerous high-tech processes have been suggested for the effective fabrication of CNC-AC-based bionanosorbents that could be innovative, economical, and beneficial in water treatment technology. Additionally, some advanced characterization methods (i.e., XRD, NMR, FTIR, DSC, TGA, BET, FESEM, XPS, AFM, TEM, DLS, ZP, etc.) along with the application mode and synergistic mechanism regarding the elimination of various pollutants have also been offered for better understanding the significance and selectivity. This can be superior to others due to its lower cost, superior efficiency, ecological nature, and greater stability. Also, the designated precursors like biomass-derived CNC and AC would be more available, economical, and reveal outstanding physicochemical, thermomechanical, microstructural, and morphological properties that must boost the capacities (∼99 %) of the forthcoming CNC-AC biocomposites. This review will be dedicated to offering a robust database addressing the effective processing of precursors, high-tech fabrication, characterization, application, and synergistic mechanisms. By determining research gaps and proposing impending instructions, this paper also offers some mathematical models to predict the experimental BTC curve.
