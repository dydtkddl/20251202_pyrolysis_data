You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermoconversion of organic solid waste in a spouted bed reactor: A review Valorization of organic solid waste (OSW) is a promising avenue for the production of value-added products and renewable energy sources. This paper offers an exhaustive review of the thermochemical conversion processes in spouted bed reactors, which yield products like biochar, bio-oil, and syngas, as well as energy forms such as heat and electricity. While numerous studies have been conducted on thermoconversion in spouted beds, there is a scarcity of systematic reviews on this topic. This paper underscores the importance of spouted beds in torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification, drawing on both experimental and simulation perspectives. By focusing on reactor design, reaction condition optimization, and catalyst enhancement, OSW can be more efficiently transformed into valuable products and bioenergy. Furthermore, the integration of simulation and modeling offers profound insights into the intricate reactions that occur during thermal conversion. Current simulation studies in spouted bed reactors are primarily centered around reaction kinetics, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, the Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) approach, and process simulation. The future integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is anticipated to enhance parameter optimization with greater precision and facilitate industrial scale-up. The paper concludes with a synthesis and contemplation of the prospective advancements in spouted bed technology.
