Advancing pyrolysis of sewage sludge: Bibliometrics analysis, life cycle assessment, and circular economy insights Pyrolysis technology holds great potential for sustainable sewage sludge treatment due to its ability to recover energy, tackle the environmental challenges, and convert by-products into valuable resources. However, a comprehensive understanding of its research progression, sustainability implications, and policy relevance remains limited. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of sewage sludge (SS) pyrolysis research, integrating sustainability through life cycle assessment (LCA) and circular economy principles. Using Scopus and VOSviewer, it highlights significant growth in research, with publications rising in this decade, reflecting increasing global interest driven by environmental and technological imperatives. China dominates the field with 693 publications and extensive international collaborations, followed by the United States and Australia. Key journals play pivotal roles in disseminating findings, while interdisciplinary contributions span environmental science, energy, and chemical engineering. Keyword analysis reveals emerging trends such as circular economy, LCA, and carbon sequestration highlighting a growing focus on sustainable practices. LCA studies show that advanced pyrolysis technologies reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and align with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Circular economy analyses underscore the economic viability of co-pyrolysis, alongside substantial energy recovery and bio-oil market potential. Additionally, this study explores the key technological challenges and mitigation strategies crucial for optimizing SS pyrolysis systems and advancing future research. These findings underscore the adaptability of SS pyrolysis for waste valorization and its role in addressing environmental challenges. This analysis provides valuable insights for advancing research, informing policy, and optimizing industrial practices, highlighting SS pyrolysis as a critical technology for sustainable waste management and resource recovery.
