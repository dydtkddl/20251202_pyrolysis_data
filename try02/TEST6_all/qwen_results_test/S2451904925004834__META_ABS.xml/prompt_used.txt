You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing pyrolysis of sewage sludge: Bibliometrics analysis, life cycle assessment, and circular economy insights Pyrolysis technology holds great potential for sustainable sewage sludge treatment due to its ability to recover energy, tackle the environmental challenges, and convert by-products into valuable resources. However, a comprehensive understanding of its research progression, sustainability implications, and policy relevance remains limited. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of sewage sludge (SS) pyrolysis research, integrating sustainability through life cycle assessment (LCA) and circular economy principles. Using Scopus and VOSviewer, it highlights significant growth in research, with publications rising in this decade, reflecting increasing global interest driven by environmental and technological imperatives. China dominates the field with 693 publications and extensive international collaborations, followed by the United States and Australia. Key journals play pivotal roles in disseminating findings, while interdisciplinary contributions span environmental science, energy, and chemical engineering. Keyword analysis reveals emerging trends such as circular economy, LCA, and carbon sequestration highlighting a growing focus on sustainable practices. LCA studies show that advanced pyrolysis technologies reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and align with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Circular economy analyses underscore the economic viability of co-pyrolysis, alongside substantial energy recovery and bio-oil market potential. Additionally, this study explores the key technological challenges and mitigation strategies crucial for optimizing SS pyrolysis systems and advancing future research. These findings underscore the adaptability of SS pyrolysis for waste valorization and its role in addressing environmental challenges. This analysis provides valuable insights for advancing research, informing policy, and optimizing industrial practices, highlighting SS pyrolysis as a critical technology for sustainable waste management and resource recovery.
