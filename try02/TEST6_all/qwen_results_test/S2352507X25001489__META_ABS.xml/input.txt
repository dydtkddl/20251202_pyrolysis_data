Advances in graphene synthesis: From conventional methods to plasma-assisted method Graphene, the two-dimensional allotropic form with a hexagonal honeycomb carbon structure, has drawn wide recognition of its exceptional properties: electrical, mechanical, and thermal. Shortly after its discovery, graphene proved to have gigantic potential in vast fields of application, including energy storage, flexible electronics, biodevices, and composite materials. This review covers the structural, electronic characteristics and synthesis techniques via conventional and emerging approaches. Traditional synthesis techniques, including mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, and other techniques based on thermal processes such as carbonization, combustion, and arc discharge, microwave are also reviewed. Novel methods like plasma-assisted methane cracking, which give promising routes toward scalable production of high-purity graphene, are also presented. This review also discusses some of the graphene applications in supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, and medical diagnostics within the context of next-generation technologies. While the potential of graphene is huge, some of the important areas of research include large-scale production, cost-effectiveness, and control over defects. This review covers the recent development that will bridge the gap between lab-scaled graphene research and its commercial applications, paving the way for future breakthroughs in nanotechnology and materials science.
