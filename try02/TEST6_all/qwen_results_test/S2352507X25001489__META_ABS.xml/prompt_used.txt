You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in graphene synthesis: From conventional methods to plasma-assisted method Graphene, the two-dimensional allotropic form with a hexagonal honeycomb carbon structure, has drawn wide recognition of its exceptional properties: electrical, mechanical, and thermal. Shortly after its discovery, graphene proved to have gigantic potential in vast fields of application, including energy storage, flexible electronics, biodevices, and composite materials. This review covers the structural, electronic characteristics and synthesis techniques via conventional and emerging approaches. Traditional synthesis techniques, including mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, and other techniques based on thermal processes such as carbonization, combustion, and arc discharge, microwave are also reviewed. Novel methods like plasma-assisted methane cracking, which give promising routes toward scalable production of high-purity graphene, are also presented. This review also discusses some of the graphene applications in supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, and medical diagnostics within the context of next-generation technologies. While the potential of graphene is huge, some of the important areas of research include large-scale production, cost-effectiveness, and control over defects. This review covers the recent development that will bridge the gap between lab-scaled graphene research and its commercial applications, paving the way for future breakthroughs in nanotechnology and materials science.
