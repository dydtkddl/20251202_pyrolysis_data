You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanocatalytic upcycling of plastic waste: Advances in selective conversion technologies for sustainable high-value products recovery Plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE) are indispensable in modern society, with global production exceeding 460 million metric tons annually and projected to nearly double by 2050. However, their extensive use generates severe environmental challenges: only ∼9 % of plastic waste is recycled, 19–23 million tons enter aquatic ecosystems each year, and associated environmental and social costs are estimated at USD 300–460 billion annually. Conventional waste management methods remain energy-intensive and environmentally damaging. Nanocatalytic chemical upcycling has recently emerged as a promising strategy, converting plastic waste into value-added products such as monomers (e.g., BHET from PET), fuels (gasoline/diesel-range hydrocarbons from PE and PP), aromatics (from PS and PC), hydrogen-rich syngas, and carbon nanomaterials (e.g., CNTs from polyolefins). This review first outlines the current landscape of plastic waste management and then examines advanced nanocatalytic approaches—including pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis, hydrocracking, photocatalysis, and electrochemical processes—highlighting their efficiencies, limitations, and recent breakthroughs. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of coordination chemistry and rational nanocatalyst design in enhancing selectivity and efficiency. Finally, emerging technologies, challenges, and future opportunities are discussed in the context of advancing a sustainable circular plastics economy.
