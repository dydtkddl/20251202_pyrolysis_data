You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of oleic acid into biofuel using fluoroplatinum oxalate zeolite supported catalyst Optimization of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oleic acid (OA) into paraffinic biofuel using zeolite supported fluoroplatinum oxalate (FPtOx/Zeol) catalyst is reported in this study. FPtOx/Zeol was synthesized via incorporation of HF modified oxalic acid (OxA) functionalized K2PtCl4 into zeolite A support. FPtOx/Zeol was characterized and the results showed highly dispersed tetrahedral and octahedral Pt species which are effective for sequential hydrogenation of the unsaturated OA bond and the HDO of OA, respectively. Furthermore, there was increase in Si/Al ratio of FPtOx/Zeol leading to loss of crystallinity due to dealumination of the extra framework and framework alumina as a result of acid attacks and calcination, respectively. FPtOx/Zeol activity was tested on the HDO of OA in a semi-batch reactor and the process parameters were optimized using validated quadratic models. The optimum conditions were 364°C, 18bar and 27.8mg FPtOx/Zeol loading under reaction time of 58min to produce 28.39% iso-C18H38 and 68.93% n-C18H38. The presence of the isomerized product was due to the combine effect of fluoride ion and oxalic acid functionalization on the catalyst. FPtOx/Zeol reusability studies showed consistency after three consecutive runs. These results are promising for further research toward commercialization of biofuel production.
