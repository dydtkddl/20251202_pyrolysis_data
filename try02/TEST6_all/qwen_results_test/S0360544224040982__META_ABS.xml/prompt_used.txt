You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interaction among cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin during pressurized pyrolysis: Importance of deoxygenation and aromatization reactions Mild pressurized pyrolysis is an effective deoxygenation method for biomass to produce high-quality energy fuels with low power consumption, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability. However, the interactions among cellulose (C), hemicellulose (H), and lignin (L) during pressurized pyrolysis remain underexplored. Herein, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to rapidly identify synergies and predict optimal blend ratios. Results demonstrated that char properties, such as volatile matter and O/C ratio, were primarily affected by lignin and its interaction with cellulose/hemicellulose during pressurized pyrolysis at 200∼280 °C. Moreover, the impact of component interactions on products characteristics during pressurized and conventional pyrolysis was essential explored. C-L interaction significantly promoted deoxygenation and carbon enrichment in semi-char, especially pronounced under pressure. A strong promotion effect of C-L interaction was observed on the formation of aromatic = C-H groups and the condensation from small to large aromatic rings. GC-MS results showed a decrease in actual sugars and furfural content, especially furfural decreased from 3.95 % and 10.93 % to 1.04 % and 1.34 % in C-L-AP and C-L-GP, respectively. The peak area of phenols increased dramatically from 30.67 % and 42.82 % to 60.73 % and 57.37 %. Similarly, furfural content in H-L-GP decreased from 10.79 % to 7.67 %, with a slight rise in phenolic substances. H-L interaction under pressure had a limited promotion of aromatic substance formation. Accordingly, a synergistic deoxygenation and aromatization reaction pathway was proposed during co-pressurized pyrolysis of C-L and H-L. The production of green carbon-rich solid fuels from biomass raw materials is a significant goal of this effort.
