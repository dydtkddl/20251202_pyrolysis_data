You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of mechanically non-recyclable waste plastics mixture: Kinetics and pyrolysis in laboratory-scale reactor Post-consumer waste plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled represent a concerning environmental issue. According to the latest available data for Europe, as much as 25% of collected post-consumer waste plastics are landfilled, 43% is energy recovered, and 32% is recycled. One possible way of recovering non-recyclable plastics is pyrolysis, which is considered environmentally friendly technology for obtaining fuel or chemicals from plastic waste. To tackle the challenge of recovering non-recyclable plastics via pyrolysis, it is necessary to determine their actual composition. Visual separation of collected non-recyclable plastics was performed, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the accuracy of visual separation. A significant amount of plastics labelled as “other” was found. Since the composition of “other” waste plastics has not been sufficiently investigated, relatively few studies on their pyrolysis have been conducted. Therefore, they were characterised and added to the mixture with other found polymer types of non-recyclable plastics. Thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to determine thermochemical behaviour and kinetic parameters required for laboratory pyrolysis investigation. Kinetic analysis was conducted using the Friedman isoconversional model-free method and non-linear multivariate regression method. The goal of this paper was to analyse the kinetics, determine the product yield and characteristics of the pyrolysis process of non-recyclable plastics over zeolite catalysts. It was found how the decomposition of non-recyclable plastics occurs in two decomposition steps. The activation energy of non-recyclable plastics was 144 kJ/mol in the first stage of decomposition and 262 kJ/mol in the second stage of decomposition. It decreased by 34% and 6.5% after fresh fluid catalytic cracking catalyst was added and 41% and 18.3% with iron-modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalyst. The yield of condensate was 55% (wax) for the original sample, and it decreased to 50% (wax and oil) and 27% (mostly oil) with fresh fluid catalytic cracking and iron modified Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 catalysts. Processes with catalysts promoted the formation of olefins and aromatic compounds in pyrolytic oil. All pyrolysis products had a high value of higher heating value ranging from 39 MJ/kg to 43 MJ/kg showing good potential for further energy use.
