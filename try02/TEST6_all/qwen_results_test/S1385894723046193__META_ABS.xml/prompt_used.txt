You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic activation of peroxymonosulfate by intrinsic defect and graphitic N of N, P co-doped carbon microspheres for BPA degradation Doping nonmetallic heteroatoms into carbonaceous materials is a proven strategy for enhancing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation in the degradation of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). Understanding the role of heteroatom doping defects and intrinsic defects (topological, vacancies, or edge defects) on PMS activation is crucial for designing more efficient carbon catalysts. Herein, we synthesized nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co-doped carbon microspheres (NPCs) through the pyrolysis of aminophosphonic acid resin (D418) precursors and utilized them to activate PMS for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. The pyrolysis temperature was found to regulate the type and degree of defects, as well as the configuration of N and P. NPC-1000 (pyrolysis temperature at 1000 °C) exhibited the highest reaction rate constant (k) (1.20 × 10−1 min−1) with the lowest N and P doping defects and the highest intrinsic defect intensity resulting from the removal of N and P during pyrolysis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and correlation analysis between defect sites and k suggest that the adsorption of PMS was facilitated by graphitic N-coordinated C and intrinsic defect sites rather than P doping defect sites, resulting in the degradation of BPA through electron transfer and radical mechanisms, specifically superoxide radicals (O•–2). Excess halide anions led a significant increase of k with only a limited formation of trichloromethane (TCM) (disinfection byproducts) in presence of 100 mM Cl−. This research offers fundamental insights into constructing intrinsic defects through regulating heteroatom configuration, intending to enhance the catalytic activity of metal-free materials.
