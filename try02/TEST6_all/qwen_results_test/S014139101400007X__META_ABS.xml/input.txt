Pyrolysis behaviors of various biomasses Thermal behavior of different types of biomass, namely forestry – Eucalyptus globulus sawdust, Norway spruce (Picea abies) thermo mechanical pulp; agricultural – energy grass, Brassica rapa, and by-products – pine cones, grape seeds, was evaluated by thermogravimetry and by analytical pyrolysis. The liquid products from pyrolysis were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass selective detector, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The elemental analysis and the calorific values of the pyrolysis residues were investigated. It has been established that the pyrolysis products consisted mainly of carboxylic acids, ketones, furans, phenols, guaiacols, catechols, and their derivatives, resulting from the degradation of the main structural components of biomass. The distribution of compounds in oils was strongly depended on biomass source, differences in the pyrolysis behavior among the biomass samples being found.
