Fabrication of nano-porous silicon oxide layers by plasma polymerisation methods We report on the synthesis of nano-porous silicon oxide (SiO2) layers by gas phase polymerisation reactions of hexamethy disiloxane and oxygen. The SiO2 layers are deposited onto one or more layers of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) particles spin coated onto the substrate surface. Subsequent annealing of the films to high temperature (500 °C) leads to the pyrolysis of the polymeric particles resulting in a 3D nanoporosity in the film. X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) show an SiO2-like surface chemistry and virtually complete removal of the organic components. These materials offer a very high surface area-to-volume ratio suitable for sensing applications.
