You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On the agglomeration tendency of carbonaceous fuels in fluidized beds Single particle pyrolysis and combustion experiments have been carried out in a lab scale fluidized bed reactor at temperatures of 600–850 °C. The behavior of three different fuels is compared: a bituminous coal (Auguste Victoria), a typical bitumen used in the cement industry, a carbon rich solid waste from the refinery industry, characterized by a very high content of metals. The bituminous coal and the refinery waste particles, during the pyrolysis stage, produce interesting carbon-sand aggregates. The outer shell of these aggregates is constituted by quartz sand particles embedded in a carbon matrix. The aggregates are hollow inside. The size of the cavity is comparable with that of the original coal particles, while the outer shell is larger. The increase of particle size due to aggregate formation slows down the combustion rate. For bitumen, no carbon-sand aggregates are observed. The relations between the fuel properties and aggregates formation are discussed, in particular the chemical composition and the pyrolysis kinetics are examined. It is concluded that heavy/tarry species formed in the early pyrolysis stages are most likely responsible for the capture of the sand particles and formation of aggregates.
