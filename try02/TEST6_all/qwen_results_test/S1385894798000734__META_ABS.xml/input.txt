Catalytic pyrolysis of methylcyclohexane: kinetics and modeling Steam pyrolysis of methylcyclohexane has been studied over potassium carbonate impregnated calcium aluminate catalyst in a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range of 973–1073 K. Compared to noncatalytic pyrolysis, the conversion was significantly higher but the hydrocarbon product selectivities were not affected in the presence of the catalyst. Incorporation of K2CO3 in the catalyst significantly reduced the coke deposited on the catalyst. The overall catalytic pyrolysis reaction could be represented by a first-order reaction with a preexponential factor of 1.1 × 103 m3/(kg s) and an activation energy of 106.9 kJ/mol. The experimental product yields could be satisfactorily modeled by use of a molecular reaction scheme, consisting of a first-order primary reaction and twenty four secondary reactions among the primary products.
