You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and application of nano-structured metal nitrides and carbides: A review Transition metal nitride and carbide have several similarities in their preparatory methods, properties, and applications. Synthetic parameters have remained the main factors that determine the effectiveness of nitrides and carbides in electrochemical storage devices, photocatalysis, environmental remediation, gas sensing and medicinal agents. This review addresses aspects of relevance to electronic structure and chemical bonding, and recent advances made in the synthesis approaches. The syntheses approaches that are particularly relevant for reducing (i) production cost, (ii) energy consumption, and (iii) synthesis time for these materials systems are discussed in detail. Furthermore some of the recent techniques like solid-solid state separation, carbothermal, gas-phase, electrochemical, sonochemical, solvothermal, sol-gel reaction and solid state reaction that offer new avenues for researchers (including a sustainability-oriented exploration) are mentioned. We discuss synthetically tunable properties (morphology, electronic characteristics, energy storage capacity, corrosion resistance, catalytic ability and gas sensing properties), heat treatment aspects, and relevant applications of these systems. We expect this review to be useful to the ever growing community of researchers that are interested in nitrides and carbides, and their applications.
