You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research on the migration and transformation law of sulfur in a molten salt heating tire pyrolysis reactor: Experiments and neural network field-driven molecular dynamics simulations The molten salt heating tire pyrolysis reactor is characterized by high thermal efficiency, making it promising for application in the tire pyrolysis industry. However, there is a lack of prior research on the characteristics of its products, particularly regarding the migration and transformation patterns of sulfur within those products. This study focuses on the sulfur transformation characteristics in the products of the proposed molten salt heating tire pyrolysis reactor. Using sulfur-containing cross-linked natural rubber molecules as the model, a neural network potential was trained based on the results, and molecular dynamics simulations of the pyrolysis process were conducted using this potential to clarify the sulfur transformation patterns. The results indicate that approximately 60% of the sulfur remains in the pyrolytic char after the pyrolysis process, around 35% exists as sulfur-containing compounds in the pyrolysis oil, and less than 5% is present in gaseous form in the pyrolysis gas. The sulfur in the char from waste tire pyrolysis primarily exists in the form of aliphatic sulfur, and as the pyrolysis temperature increases, the proportion of aliphatic sulfur in the char gradually decreases. Both H2S and SO2 concentrations increase with rising pyrolysis temperatures, with the concentrations of H2S and SO2 rising from 836 µL/g and 74 µL/g at 450 °C to 987 µL/g and 101 µL/g at 525 °C, respectively; the concentration of H2S is significantly higher than that of SO2. The atomic forces calculated from the neural network potential align well with those obtained from DFT calculations, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.381 eV/Å and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.607 eV/Å.
