You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced microwave absorption capacity of iron-based catalysts by introducing Co and Ni for microwave pyrolysis of waste COVID-19 Masks Inexpensive iron-based catalysts are the most promising catalysts for microwave-assisted deconstruction of waste plastics. However, the microwave heating efficiency of most of the synthesized iron-based catalysts is very low, in particular, the FeAl catalyst was prepared by microwave combustion method, and its mixture with disposable medical masks (DMMs) was only heated to about 150℃ within 10 min. Here, we introduce the second-phase metals (Co or Ni) into the FeAl catalyst, resulting in the rearrangement of the catalyst structure and electrons to give the catalyst good microwave absorption ability. The mixture of the catalyst and DMMs can be quickly heated to above 900℃ in 10 min, especially after reaching the melting point of plastic, the instantaneous heating rate reaches 350 ℃·min−1. under the unique microwave hot-spot pyrolysis mechanism, DMMs can be rapidly pyrolyzed into carbon nanotubes (19.65 wt%) and gas (77.65 wt%) within 14 min due to the efficient dehydrogenation efficiency and activity of Co. The corresponding H2 yield is up to 38.66 mmolH2·g−1 DMMs, and the percentage of CO and H2 in the gas is as high as 90 wt%. This work improves the microwave conversion efficiency of iron-based catalysts by introducing second phase metals, and waste DMMs were efficiently converted into CO, H2 and CNTs, which can also be extended to other polymer or biomass chemical cycles.
