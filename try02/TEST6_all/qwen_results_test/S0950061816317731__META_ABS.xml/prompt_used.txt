You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Humins as promising material for producing sustainable carbohydrate-derived building materials Nowadays biobased building materials are used in various fields and for a wide range of applications such as polymers, fillers, coatings, adhesives, impregnation materials or high performance composites. This work focuses on humins, a biomacromolecular by-product of a HydroxyMethylFurfural/FuranDiCarboxylic Acid biorefinery. Humins are obtained by acidic treatment of polysaccharides and show very interesting potential as a reactive, semi-ductile thermoset matrix to impregnate cellulosic fibres. Therefore, humins have the essential characteristics to develop a new class of thermoset materials and composites, offering excellent possibilities to increase the renewable carbon content of the final products and improve its properties. A proper characterization of the neat humins in terms of solubility, flow behaviour and thermal resistance is essential in order to find the optimal parameters of processing humins solutions as well as co-reactive mixtures for impregnations or to prepare composites. In addition the study further indicates that humins enhance the modulus and the tensile strength of pure polyfurfurylalcohol resins. It was also shown that there is a difference in behaviour when sulfuric acid or maleic anhydride is used as initiator. The most optimal initiator will depend on application and preferred processing conditions. These encouraging results assure an important future for humins as economic green matrix for the production of composites and wood impregnation.
