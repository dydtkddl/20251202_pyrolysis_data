You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Composting treatment increases the risk of microplastics pollution in process and compost products Organic compost is a significant carrier of microplastics (MPs) entering agricultural soil. However, the extent of MPs pollution during composting, a widely employed organic waste treatment technology, remains unknown. This study investigated MPs dynamic pollution characteristics during composting and compost products using agricultural wastes as raw materials and quantitatively evaluated ecological risks of MPs pollution. Sorting/screening before and after composting significantly reduced MPs abundance by 29.4 % and 32.1 %, respectively, but substantial quantities of MPs persisted in final compost products. Microplastics were mainly 0.5–1 mm (30.3 %), colored fibers/fragments composed of PP/PE, PE, or PP. Regardless of whether plastics in raw materials were sorted, composting increased MPs abundance from 5133–7867 items kg−1 in raw materials to 5667–11200 items kg−1 in compost products and smaller MPs (<1 mm) proportion from 48.5 % to 54.4 %, while significantly decreased size from 1328 μm to 1093 μm. After composting, MPs exhibited rougher morphologies (folds, cracks, and grooves) and adhered to more mineral colloids, and the pollution level increased. Collectively, composting treatment enhances MPs pollution risk both during composting process and in compost products. These findings present a theoretical reference for the establishment of limit standards for MPs in organic compost.
