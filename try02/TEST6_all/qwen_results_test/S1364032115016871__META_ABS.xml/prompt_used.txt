You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Blends of pyrolysis oil, petroleum, and other bio-based fuels: A review Pyrolysis oil is a promising renewable fuel. However, crude pyrolysis oil use in conventional engines or boilers can be limited without modifications to these systems. Other bio-oils such as oils from vegetables or animal wastes face similar issues. One option to enhance the applicability of bio-oils is blending with petroleum or other bio-based fuels. A literature review on the blending of bio-oils to enhance their fuel properties is presented. Included in the review is information on types of oils that have been blended, additives used to enhance blending, and engine/boiler performance. Upgrading, such as transesterification or hydroprocessing, of bio-oils is often used to improve fuel properties. However, there is limited work on blending of “crude” bio-fuels (e.g. unrefined), such as pyrolysis oils and bio-based waste oils, Therefore, included in this review is a preliminary study of blending of fast pyrolysis oil from hardwood with fish oil extracted from fish processing by-product. The heating value and pH of the blended pyrolysis/fish oil is increased relative to pure pyrolysis oil while the cold flow properties of the blends are better than the pure fish oil. However, the miscibility of the oils is limited and therefore, the next step is to determine if this can be enhanced through upgrading or additives.
