You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Rheology and applications of highly filled polymers: A review of current understanding This paper reviews current knowledge about the rheology and applications of highly concentrated molten polymers, focusing on hard particles with sizes ranging from several 100snm to a few microns. Understanding the rheological properties should assist the formulation and processing of such polymeric materials. The main factors affecting the rheological behavior of these composites are discussed, such as size distribution, nature and shape of the particles, interactions, maximum packing fraction and matrix viscosity. The matrix viscosity is a key parameter that has to be optimized to be low enough to enable the material processing and high enough to improve the dispersion. The size polydispersity of the fillers facilitates higher filling levels and decreases the melt mixture viscosity for a given filler content. The different types of interactions (viz. particle-particle, particle-matrix) are described to interpret the phenomena arising during processing better. On the other hand, mixing is of particular importance to reach high-quality dispersion and distribution of the particles in the matrix in order to obtain a homogenous mixture and desirable properties. The mixing methods and tools to characterize the degree of mixing are reviewed. The use of organic dispersants is generally necessary to improve and control the dispersion degree and flow properties. Mathematical models relating the viscosity as a function of the filler content for unimodal and bimodal highly filled suspensions are summarized. Constraints and flow instabilities often lead to non-linear rheological behavior such as wall slip, particle-binder segregation, swelling and surface instabilities phenomena; these are discussed. Finally, the latest applications for highly filled systems (such as solid propellants, flame retardancy, magnetic materials, ceramic materials, batteries, etc.) are presented as a source of inspiration for industrial improvements.
