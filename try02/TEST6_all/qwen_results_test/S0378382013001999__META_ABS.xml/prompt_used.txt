You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The influence of reaction parameters on characteristics of pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene using a fluidized bed reactor The aim of this study was to produce pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) in a pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor. The influence of various reaction parameters, such as temperature, feed rate and the kind of fluidizing medium, was investigated. The maximum oil yields were about 87wt.% (474°C) for the HIPS and 84wt.% (525°C) for the ABS. A higher feed rate and the use of product gas as a fluidizing medium were favorable for the oil production. The oils produced from the HIPS pyrolysis consisted chiefly of toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, cumene, α-methylstyrene and styrene dimers and they appeared to be usable directly as a fuel or chemical source. Main compounds of the ABS pyrolysis oils were similar to those obtained from the HIPS, except for nitrogen-containing compounds. In the nitrogen mass balance of the ABS pyrolysis products, most of the nitrogen was concentrated in the oil with a content of 6.5–7.1wt.%. The pyrolysis oil from the ABS seemed to require further treatment for its use as a fuel source.
