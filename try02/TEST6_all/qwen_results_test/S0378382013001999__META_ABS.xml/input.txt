The influence of reaction parameters on characteristics of pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene using a fluidized bed reactor The aim of this study was to produce pyrolysis oils from waste high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) in a pyrolysis plant equipped with a fluidized bed reactor. The influence of various reaction parameters, such as temperature, feed rate and the kind of fluidizing medium, was investigated. The maximum oil yields were about 87wt.% (474°C) for the HIPS and 84wt.% (525°C) for the ABS. A higher feed rate and the use of product gas as a fluidizing medium were favorable for the oil production. The oils produced from the HIPS pyrolysis consisted chiefly of toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, cumene, α-methylstyrene and styrene dimers and they appeared to be usable directly as a fuel or chemical source. Main compounds of the ABS pyrolysis oils were similar to those obtained from the HIPS, except for nitrogen-containing compounds. In the nitrogen mass balance of the ABS pyrolysis products, most of the nitrogen was concentrated in the oil with a content of 6.5–7.1wt.%. The pyrolysis oil from the ABS seemed to require further treatment for its use as a fuel source.
