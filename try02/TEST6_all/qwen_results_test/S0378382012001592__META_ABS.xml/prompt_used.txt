You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocarbons obtained by waste plastic pyrolysis: Comparative analysis of decomposition described by different kinetic models Thermal degradation of waste polymers has been investigated in a batch reactor at temperatures of 410, 430 and 450°C using atmospheric pressure without catalysts. Raw materials were real wastes (plastics, paper, etc.), but considerably differences have been found among them. According to FTIR analysis raw materials contained polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and polyamide 6. The composition of plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc.) was different, however in case of one sample (W-3) significant motor oil content has been demonstrated. Different hydrocarbon fractions were produced in the cracking reactions: gases, pyrolytic oil and heavy oil. The polymer destruction was described based on different reaction kinetic approaches (yields of volatile products, theory of continuous distribution, and number of scissions per an average polymer chain) and reaction kinetic parameters (e.g. activation energy of the degradation) have been calculated then results were compared. The values obtained have also been compared to literature data and try to reflect the complexity of pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis reactions could be well described by the used models. The calculated results well approached the data obtained from the literature, but due to the difference in raw material composition, the calculated kinetic parameters have been different, too.
