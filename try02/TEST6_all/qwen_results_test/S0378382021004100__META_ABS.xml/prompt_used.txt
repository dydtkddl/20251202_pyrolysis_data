You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of metal-doping mesoporous biochar catalyst for co-valorizing biomass and plastic waste into valuable hydrocarbons, syngas, and carbons The present study was aimed to explore a cost-effective route to produce metal-doping mesoporous graphite-like catalysts, which utilized metal chlorides (ZnCl2, FeCl3, and NiCl2) to modulate biochar within mesopore-creating, metal-doping, and graphitization simultaneously accomplished in the one-step thermal process. The properties of these as-synthesized catalysts were comprehensively characterized by a sequence of analytic methods (e.g., BET, NH3-TPD, SEM, EDS, TEM, FTIR, XRD, and Raman analysis). The carbon yields and HHV of bio-oils from ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste over the as-synthesized catalysts were around 50C% and 43 MJ/kg, respectively. Up to 96% of selectivity toward hydrocarbons when Ni/C was used as the catalyst, of which aromatic hydrocarbons accounted for nearly 40%. On the other hand, Fe/C was in favor of the production of H2 (90 NmL/gfeedstock) and syngas (~133 NmL/gfeedstock), which respectively occupying ~44 vol% and over 64 vol% in the gas; it also favored the generation of carbon nanotubes. Biochar produced from co-pyrolysis showed a high HHV at 28.33 MJ/kg, indicating the high potential as a solid fuel. In addition, the thermal decomposition behaviors and kinetics of biomass and plastic waste over the as-synthesized catalysts were also investigated by thermogravimetric analysis.
