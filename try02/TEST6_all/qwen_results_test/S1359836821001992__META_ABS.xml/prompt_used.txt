You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrating carbon fiber reclamation and additive manufacturing for recycling CFRP waste There is a large amount of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) waste generated annually, mainly due to the difficulty in recycling CFRPs. This work presents a novel additive manufacturing-based recycling approach that can be used to reclaim CFRP waste and to re-manufacture the carbon fiber into 3D printed composite parts. A trial of this idea was set up, in which carbon fiber was first reclaimed from CFRP waste using supercritical fluid and then mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone to produce composite filaments. The filaments were then fed into a printer of fused deposition modeling (i.e., a 3D printing process) and the recycled CFRP parts were fabricated. The engineering application-oriented tests demonstrate that the reclaimed carbon fiber can modify the performances of 3D printed part effectively in terms of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, heat conduction and wear resistance. This work illustrates that the additive manufacturing-based recycling approach offers a possible strategy to recycle CFRP waste and fabricate high-performance engineering parts with complex geometries, which are economical and environmentally friendly.
