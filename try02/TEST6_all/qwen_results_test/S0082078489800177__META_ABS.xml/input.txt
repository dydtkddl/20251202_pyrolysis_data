Correlations for effects of coal type and pressure on tar yields from rapid devolatilization A correlation relating maximum tar yield from rapid pyrolysis (heating rate ≈100–1000° C/s) to coal type and total pressure is presented. The tar yield predicted from the correlation represents the maximum amount of tar to be expected during the devolatilization phase of the coal combustion process. Coal-type effects are treated using only information on the elemental C, H, O, and S analysis of the unpyrolysed coal. Pressure effects are correlated via empirical parameters obtained from best-fit analyses of existing data. The correlation is tested against a large set of experimental data representing a wide range of coals (37 coals, ranging from lignites to anthracites) and pressures (‘vacuum’ to 9 MPa). Good agreement between the predicted and experimental yields are obtained for all coals and pressures, with a standard error of estimate of ±3 wt% dmmf. This result is a significant improvement over predictions from existing correlations.
