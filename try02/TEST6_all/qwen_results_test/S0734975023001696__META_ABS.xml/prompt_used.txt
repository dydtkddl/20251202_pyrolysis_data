You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass directional pyrolysis based on element economy to produce high-quality fuels, chemicals, carbon materials – A review Biomass is regarded as the only carbon-containing renewable energy source and has performed an increasingly important role in the gradual substitution of conventional fossil energy, which also contributes to the goals of carbon neutrality. In the past decade, the academic field has paid much greater attention to the development of biomass pyrolysis technologies. However, most biomass conversion technologies mainly derive from the fossil fuel industry, and it must be noticed that the large element component difference between biomass and traditional fossil fuels. Thus, it's necessary to develop biomass directional pyrolysis technology based on the unique element distribution of biomass for realizing enrichment target element (i.e., element economy). This article provides a broad review of biomass directional pyrolysis to produce high-quality fuels, chemicals, and carbon materials based on element economy. The C (carbon) element economy of biomass pyrolysis is realized by the production of high-performance carbon materials from different carbon sources. For efficient H (hydrogen) element utilization, high-value hydrocarbons could be obtained by the co-pyrolysis or catalytic pyrolysis of biomass and cheap hydrogen source. For improving the O (oxygen) element economy, different from the traditional hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process, the high content of O in biomass would also become an advantage because biomass is an appropriate raw material for producing oxygenated liquid additives. Based on the N (nitrogen) element economy, the recent studies on preparing N-containing chemicals (or N-rich carbon materials) are reviewed. Moreover, the feasibility of the biomass poly-generation industrialization and the suitable process for different types of target products are also mentioned. Moreover, the enviro-economic assessment of representative biomass pyrolysis technologies is analyzed. Finally, the brief challenges and perspectives of biomass pyrolysis are provided.
