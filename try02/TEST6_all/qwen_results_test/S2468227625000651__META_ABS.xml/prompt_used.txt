You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and numerical analysis of a reactor for plastic waste conversion and performance evaluation of pyrolytic fuel blend with diesel in a 1.6 HDi engine This study examines the potential of fuel obtained through pyrolysis of plastic waste as a substitute for traditional diesel in powering diesel engines. For this purpose, reactor optimization was conducted through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using ANSYS software, minimizing thermal stresses and deformations, thus ensuring the resistance and stability of the pyrolysis unit materials at high temperatures. A maximum yield of 74.3 % by weight of Crude Pyrolytic Oil (CPO) was achieved at temperatures of 380 °C and 390 °C. FT-IR and GC–MS analyses revealed that CPO oil primarily consists of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds, with carbon chains ranging from C8 to C28. After filtration and purification of the CPO oil, the PPFO10 blend, consisting of 10 % pyrolytic oil and 90 % diesel, was tested on a 1.6HDi diesel engine installed in a vehicle. The performance and emissions of this blend were contrasted with those of pure diesel. The findings indicated that the PPFO10 blend exhibited performance almost equivalent to that of pure diesel. Full-load tests indicated slightly reduced CO2 emissions, while CO, UHC, and NOx emissions were slightly increased with the PPFO10 blend. However, the study concludes that the utilization of pyrolytic oil as a substitute for diesel holds promising potential for reducing fossil resource depletion.
