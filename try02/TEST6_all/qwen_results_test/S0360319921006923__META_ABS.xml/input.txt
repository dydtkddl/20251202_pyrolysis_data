Hydrogen-rich syngas produced from co-gasification of municipal solid waste and wheat straw in an oxygen-enriched air fluidized bed The gasification characteristics of solid waste and wheat straw were investigated in an oxygen-rich atmosphere by using a laboratory-scale continuous fluidized bed reactor in the range of oxidation equivalent (ER) of 0.2~0.5 and reaction temperature of 600 °C~900 °C. Gasification of biomass and waste is an economical method for hydrogen production. When air is used as a carrier gas to gasify municipal solid waste, increasing the oxygen concentration can effectively increase the hydrogen concentration of the syngas. The product distribution of gasification reaction under different mixing ratios and reaction parameters was obtained. As is shown in the results, first, when the ER is between 0.2 and 0.5, if ER decreases by 0.1, the hydrogen concentration of gas production will increase by about 30%; second, if the oxygen concentration increases by 5%, the hydrogen concentration of gas production will increase by about 14%, and the calorific value of gas production will increase by about 14–18%; third, after adding wheat straw in a ratio of 1:1, due to the reduction of plastics, the overall yield of syngas decreased, but the yield of hydrogen increased, and the concentration of hydrogen in syngas increased by 6.4%.
