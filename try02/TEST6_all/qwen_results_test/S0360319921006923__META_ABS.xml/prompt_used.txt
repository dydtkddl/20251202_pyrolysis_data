You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen-rich syngas produced from co-gasification of municipal solid waste and wheat straw in an oxygen-enriched air fluidized bed The gasification characteristics of solid waste and wheat straw were investigated in an oxygen-rich atmosphere by using a laboratory-scale continuous fluidized bed reactor in the range of oxidation equivalent (ER) of 0.2~0.5 and reaction temperature of 600 °C~900 °C. Gasification of biomass and waste is an economical method for hydrogen production. When air is used as a carrier gas to gasify municipal solid waste, increasing the oxygen concentration can effectively increase the hydrogen concentration of the syngas. The product distribution of gasification reaction under different mixing ratios and reaction parameters was obtained. As is shown in the results, first, when the ER is between 0.2 and 0.5, if ER decreases by 0.1, the hydrogen concentration of gas production will increase by about 30%; second, if the oxygen concentration increases by 5%, the hydrogen concentration of gas production will increase by about 14%, and the calorific value of gas production will increase by about 14–18%; third, after adding wheat straw in a ratio of 1:1, due to the reduction of plastics, the overall yield of syngas decreased, but the yield of hydrogen increased, and the concentration of hydrogen in syngas increased by 6.4%.
