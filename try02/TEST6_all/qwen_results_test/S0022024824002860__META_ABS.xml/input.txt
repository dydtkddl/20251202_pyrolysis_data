Growth mechanism of a batch deposited SiC coating on large-size graphite plates based on multi-scale simulation Graphite plate was used as a substrate material for growing semiconductor films in the MOCVD process. The graphite plate was protected in the MOCVD process by the SiC coating deposited on its surface. Achieving batch production of SiC coating deposited on large-size graphite plates was critical. In our previous work, the CVD SiC process was investigated via simulations and experiments within a specific parameter range. Experimentally compatible simulation models were established, and parametric conditions for depositing high-quality coatings were obtained. However, in our recent investigation, outstanding deposition was found at simply achievable low-pressure conditions outside the previously reported deposition parameter range. Here, CVD experiments were conducted over broad parameter ranges, and previous models were partially corrected. The mechanism of outstanding deposition in low-pressure conditions and coating growth was explained by multi-scale simulations and experiments. The impact of parameters on CVD SiC was investigated by varying the gas flow rate, deposition pressure, and molar ratio of methyltrichlorosilane(MTS) to H2(nMTS:nH2) during the simulation. The simulation and experimental results were provided as a scientific basis for the process modification of large-scale batch preparation of CVD SiC.
