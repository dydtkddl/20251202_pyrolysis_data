You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Growth mechanism of a batch deposited SiC coating on large-size graphite plates based on multi-scale simulation Graphite plate was used as a substrate material for growing semiconductor films in the MOCVD process. The graphite plate was protected in the MOCVD process by the SiC coating deposited on its surface. Achieving batch production of SiC coating deposited on large-size graphite plates was critical. In our previous work, the CVD SiC process was investigated via simulations and experiments within a specific parameter range. Experimentally compatible simulation models were established, and parametric conditions for depositing high-quality coatings were obtained. However, in our recent investigation, outstanding deposition was found at simply achievable low-pressure conditions outside the previously reported deposition parameter range. Here, CVD experiments were conducted over broad parameter ranges, and previous models were partially corrected. The mechanism of outstanding deposition in low-pressure conditions and coating growth was explained by multi-scale simulations and experiments. The impact of parameters on CVD SiC was investigated by varying the gas flow rate, deposition pressure, and molar ratio of methyltrichlorosilane(MTS) to H2(nMTS:nH2) during the simulation. The simulation and experimental results were provided as a scientific basis for the process modification of large-scale batch preparation of CVD SiC.
