You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atomic-scale dissolution corrosion mechanism of additively-manufactured 316L steels in liquid lead-bismuth eutectic In this paper, the dissolution corrosion mechanism of 316L steels fabricated by laser-powder-bed-fusion (LPBF) with and without subsequent hot-isostatic-pressing (HIP) has been studied under multilength scales after exposure to static lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) with a reactor-relevant oxygen concentration of ∼5 × 10−7 wt.% dissolved, at 500 °C for up to 4000h. The results show that both steels are subjected to dissolution corrosion with LBE preferentially attacking defective areas. The average dissolution depths of “LPBF 316L” steel are much larger than those of “LPBF+HIP 316L” steel, suggesting that the nonequilibrium defects generated by LPBF significantly exacerbate dissolution corrosion, whereas dissolution resistance recovers following HIP treatment. The dissolution zones invariably undergo austenite-to-ferrite phase transformation. Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) and Nishiyama-Wassermann (N-W) are the predominant orientation relationships (ORs) of α and γ phases, especially in “LPBF+HIP 316L” steel. While Pitsch OR is also identified, it constitutes only a small fraction. Atomic-resolution characterization reveals that at the penetration tips along mechanical nanotwin boundaries, a one-nanometer-thick, Bi- and Ni-rich, coherent interfacial phase forms at the interface between steel matrix and a nanosized amorphous oxide scale, mediating the leaching of Ni. Theoretical computations confirm that Bi is energetically more favorable than Pb in segregating on austenitic steel surfaces. The interfacial segregation of Bi facilitates the outer diffusion of Ni due to the negative enthalpy of mixing of the Ni-Bi system. Fe and Cr are also extracted through oxidation/decomposition processes. Consequently, the dissolution process involves simultaneous removal of all three steel elements, rather than just Ni. An atomic-scale dissolution mechanism scheme is proposed.
