Unveiling oak leaves-derived biochar/Fe3O4/CuO nanocatalyst for biodiesel production and declining tractor engine exhaust emissions Biodiesel production using biochar/Fe₃O₄-CuO is advantageous due to the combined high surface area, magnetic properties, and enhanced catalytic activity, which improve reaction efficiency and enable easy catalyst recovery. In this scientific research, the biochar/Fe3O4-CuO nanocatalyst was synthesized using pyrolysis and co-precipitation techniques and then employed as a highly reclaimable heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of biodiesel from Annona reticulata L. oil. Several analytical techniques were employed to assess the catalyst structure, which demonstrated that the biochar/Fe3O4-CuO nanocatalyst possesses a high specific surface area along with significant magnetic properties. The ultrasonic irradiation transesterification was conducted to produce biodiesel from Annona reticulata oil to enhance the reaction rate and reduce the reaction time and energy consumption. Besides, the catalytic efficiency was notable, achieving a maximum biodiesel yield of 97.90 % within just 30 min and optimum conditions (methanol to oil ratio=12.2 mol/mol, catalyst content=2.13 wt%, and temperature= 65 °C). The reusability of the biochar/Fe3O4-CuO nanocatalyst was also assessed, showing remarkable stability. Even after seven reuse cycles, the catalyst maintained a biodiesel yield of over 90 %, underscoring its durability and cost-effectiveness for repeated applications. Moreover, thermodynamic and kinetic analyses revealed that the biodiesel production process was endothermic, with an enthalpy change (∆H°) of 89.6 kJ/mol. The activation energy for the transesterification process was determined to be 57.42 kJ/mol, indicating that the biochar/Fe3O4-CuO nanocatalyst provides substantial activation energy to drive the reaction efficiently. Further studies examined the impact of blending biodiesel at 10, 20, and 30 vol% with diesel and assessed the effects on a tractor diesel engine. The results demonstrated positive outcomes, particularly in the reduction of carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. This suggests that the biodiesel blends not only perform well in terms of energy production but also contribute to environmental benefits by lowering harmful emissions.
