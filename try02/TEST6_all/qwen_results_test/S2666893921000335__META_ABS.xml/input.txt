Cellulose bionanocomposites for sustainable planet and people: A global snapshot of preparation, properties, and applications Although extensive research and development efforts are being made in the field of bio-based composites as advanced functional materials, we are yet far away from bioeconomy-driven sustainbale future planet. Cellulose-based multifunctional materials has emerged, expanded, intensified and adapted over the years, facilitating unique classes of high-performance products that hold promise for opening new horizons in interdisciplinary science and technology domains. The objective of this review is to map, navigate and timely update the state-of-the-art in this field, with a special importance on structure-properties-applications space to deduce general implications for developing rationally designed future bionanocomposites with improved property profiles. Also highlighted herein are the emerging and less explored application areas, thus advancing a step forward toward green and sustainable functional materials and products. Finally, the challenges and impediments are also discussed along with the future directions.
