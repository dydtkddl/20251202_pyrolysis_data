You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potential role of biochar in water treatment Since the past decades, the water dearth has turned attention of researchers towards its restoration along with the remediation of contaminated water in lieu of rejuvenating valuable resources. Through the treatment of wastewater, it is possible to decrease the exploitation of natural water resources as well as alleviating the problem of water shortage. As a circular or closed loop economy solution, the organic waste such as biomass can be renewed in biochar, a carbon rich product by means of thermochemical conversion methods. Biochar demonstrates an incredible potential in water treatment for removing different pollutants considering low-cost, widely accessible feed-stock, and easy surface modifications for enhancing contamination remediating properties as well. Hence, this manuscript focuses on an overview of remediating toxic pollutants employing biochar. The biochar production methods and different feedstocks have been discussed. Process parameters like selection of biomass as a raw material, pyrolyzing temperature, residence time, pre-treatment of biomass, and post treatment methods, etc. are the determining factors of carbonaceous biochar yields in a thermochemical conversion method. The key mechanisms like pore-filling, precipitation, complexation, ion-exchange, diffusion, partitioning, π–π electron-donor-acceptor interactions, H-bonding, and electrostatic attraction, etc. drive the specific type of contaminant to be phased out from polluted environments whether organic/inorganic in nature. Activation/modification (physical/chemical) of biochar is another aspect for its rising utilization in the field of expelling specific contaminations. The application of biochar in water treatment has many limitations. In order to meet the challenges, biochar-based materials may be developed with improved physicochemical properties and efficiency of biochar, along with combined advantages of biochar and other materials. This manuscript covers different perspectives of biochar viz. biochar and production techniques, mechanisms involved in removal of toxic contaminants from aqueous medium using bio-char, modification/activation methods used to improve the characteristics of biochar, biochars and different biochar-based materials for remediating aqueous environments, associated challenges and future directions. This compilation of evidences focused on biochar technology in water treatment will assist new researchers in their studies through developing a thorough understanding of the research and development of eco-friendly biochar-based environmental remediation.
