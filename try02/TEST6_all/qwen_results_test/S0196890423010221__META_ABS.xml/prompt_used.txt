You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast pyrolysis simulation via kinetic approach and multivariate analysis to assess the effect of biomass properties on product yields, properties, and pyrolyzer performance Fast pyrolysis (FP) is the thermochemical conversion of biomasses and other carbonaceous materials into bio-oil (liquid), char (solid), and gas products to be used to generate heat, power, chemicals, and fuels of lower greenhouse gas emissions. Considering biomass properties highly affect the FP performance, this work used simulation and multivariate analysis tools to assess the effect of the composition of nine Brazilian biomasses on the FP energy demands, product yields, and bio-oil properties. A simulation, representing a pyrolyzer (480 °C, 1-s residence time), product recovery, and char combustion to meet FP energy demands, was built in Aspen Plus v.10 and validated against experimental data. A dataset correlating biomass compositions from 60 sources and FP outputs was obtained and analyzed, via two statistical methods, to detect similarities between feedstocks and correlate biomass inputs and process outputs. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) separated the feedstocks into two main clusters: agricultural and woody biomasses. The main differences were associated with agricultural feedstocks having higher biomass H/C ratios, lower carbon and volatiles contents, and being of the CHL type (cellulose > hemicellulose > lignin), resulting in lower char and higher gas yields. As for correlations between inputs and outputs, HCA and principal component analysis (PCA) divided the parameters into five main groups: (i) biomass O/C ratio and cellulose content; (ii) bio-oil yield, heating value, and extractives content; (iii) biomass H/C ratio, hemicellulose content, and bio-oil quality metrics; (iv) ash content, char yield, and pyrolyzer heat duty; and (v) biomass lignin, volatiles, and heating value with gas yield and heating value. Several anticorrelations were also detected (e.g., bio-oil yield anticorrelated to bio-oil properties; char yield anticorrelated to gas yield). This work hopes to serve as a simplified roadmap for relationships between biomass properties and FP performance, providing guidelines for biomass selection for different bio-oil downstream applications and perspectives on future works on FP simulation.
