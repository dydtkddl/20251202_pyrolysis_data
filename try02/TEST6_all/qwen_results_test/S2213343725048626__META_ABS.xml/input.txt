Graphitic carbon nitride supported single-atom catalysts: Functionalization and strategy for advanced photocatalytic pharmaceutical pollutant remediation Single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic pharmaceutical drug degradation, owing to their intriguing properties and significant advantages over traditional photocatalysts. The synergistic effect of wide photon absorption range, tunable bandgap, and long π-conjugated framework of g-C3N4 (g-CN), with exceptional atom efficiency and unique catalytic properties of SACs, hastens catalytic efficiency. This review comprehensively elaborates the associated advantages and functionalization strategies of SACs/g-CN, aiding unique electronic configurations, high atom utilization, along with improved catalytic activity. Further, the review summaries various fabrication techniques with the advancing feature including significant observations from suitable reported articles. Additionally, we have also briefly highlighted various characterization techniques to verify the formation of SACs/g-CN and narrated key parameters responsible for the increment of activity, citing findings from recent reported literature. Moreover, the review also focuses on the effective degradation of various pharmaceutical drug pollutants, taking currently published articles as a case study. In the final section, the review describes the associated challenges and prospects of these SACs/g-CN hybrids in detail so as to provide enough information for future development and improvement/scope of such systems, aiming at addressing other emerging contaminants.
