You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphitic carbon nitride supported single-atom catalysts: Functionalization and strategy for advanced photocatalytic pharmaceutical pollutant remediation Single-atom catalysts (SACs) anchored graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic pharmaceutical drug degradation, owing to their intriguing properties and significant advantages over traditional photocatalysts. The synergistic effect of wide photon absorption range, tunable bandgap, and long π-conjugated framework of g-C3N4 (g-CN), with exceptional atom efficiency and unique catalytic properties of SACs, hastens catalytic efficiency. This review comprehensively elaborates the associated advantages and functionalization strategies of SACs/g-CN, aiding unique electronic configurations, high atom utilization, along with improved catalytic activity. Further, the review summaries various fabrication techniques with the advancing feature including significant observations from suitable reported articles. Additionally, we have also briefly highlighted various characterization techniques to verify the formation of SACs/g-CN and narrated key parameters responsible for the increment of activity, citing findings from recent reported literature. Moreover, the review also focuses on the effective degradation of various pharmaceutical drug pollutants, taking currently published articles as a case study. In the final section, the review describes the associated challenges and prospects of these SACs/g-CN hybrids in detail so as to provide enough information for future development and improvement/scope of such systems, aiming at addressing other emerging contaminants.
