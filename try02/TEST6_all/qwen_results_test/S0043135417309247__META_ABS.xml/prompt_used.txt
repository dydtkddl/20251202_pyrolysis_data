You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Composition and functional group characterization of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in activated sludge: the impacts of polymerization degree of proteinaceous substrates Characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in activated sludge strongly depend on wastewater substrates. Proteinaceous substrates (ProS) present in heterogeneous polymeric form are intrinsic and important parts of wastewater substrates for microorganisms in activated sludge systems. However, correlations between ProS and characteristics of EPS are scarce. This study systematically explored the impacts of monomeric (Mono-), low polymeric (LoP-) and high polymeric (HiP-) ProS on compositions and functional groups of EPS in activated sludge. The results showed that the change of polymerization degree of ProS significantly altered the composition of EPS. Compared to EPSMono-ProS, the proportion of proteins in EPSLoP-ProS and EPSHiP-ProS increased by 12.8% and 27.7%, respectively, while that of polysaccharides decreased by 22.9% and 63.6%, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of humic compounds in EPSLoP-ProS and EPSHiP-ProS were ∼6 and ∼16–fold higher than that in EPSMono-ProS, respectively. The accumulation of humic compounds in EPS increased the unsaturation degree of EPS molecules, and thereby reduced the energy requirement for electrons transition of amide bonds and aromatic groups. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses detected more molecular clusters in EPSHiP-ProS, indicating more complex composition of EPS in HiP-ProS fed activated sludge. Spectroscopic characterization revealed the dominance of hydrocarbon, protein, polysaccharide and aromatic associated bonds in all three EPS. Nevertheless, with the increase of polymerization degree of ProS, the protein associated bonds (such as CONH, CO, NC, NH) increased, while the polysaccharide associated bonds (such as COC, COH, OCOH) decreased. This paper paves a path to understand the role of ProS in affecting the production and characteristics of EPS in biological wastewater treatment systems.
