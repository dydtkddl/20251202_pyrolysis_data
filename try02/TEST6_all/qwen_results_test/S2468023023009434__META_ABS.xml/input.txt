A comprehensive review of recent developments in metal-organic framework/polymer composites and their applications The development of polymer composites with nanostructures of various sizes within the polymer matrix has the potential to be used in a wide range of technologies, including gas separation, photodegradation, flame retardancy, etc. The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as versatile nanosized fillers could greatly increase the range of capabilities and open doors for numerous applications with added advantages. Although there have been studies on the use of MOF/polymer composites, there hasn't been a thorough evaluation of the materials, their developments, and applications. Hence, in this review we try to portray the fabrication of MOF/polymer composites and its applications in different fields like separation, corrosion, flame retardancy and more. This review also gives insights into the historical advances of MOF and its synthesis in a comprehensive way. This review highlights the recent trends and advances in MOFs and MOF based polymer composites.
