You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyro-GC/MS and thermal degradation studies in polystyrene–poly(vinyl chloride) blends The blends of polystyrene (PS) using various proportions of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) were prepared and the thermal decomposition temperatures of these blends were measured from the dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) carried out under inert atmosphere from ambient to 800°C at different heating rates. Kinetic parameters of the degradation process in pure PS and its blends with various proportions of PVC were calculated. Activation energy of the degradation process in the blends was found to increase with the inclusion of small amount of PVC in PS. The stabilization effect on PS varies with the heating rates and the composition of the blends. The pyrolysis gas-chromatographic mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) studies were also carried out over a range of temperature (330–370°C) and the intensity of major ions produced during pyrolysis were separated and measured though GC/MS. Using a small amount of PVC in the matrix showed a marked reduction in the major pyrolysis products of PS. The stabilization of PS in the blends has been explained by a mechanism involving interaction between the degrading products from the polymer components leading to a stable polymer network. The extent of interaction is affected by the changing morphology of the blends with composition.
