Functional nanocarbons from waste plastics for energy storage applications The mismanagement of waste plastic could lead to significant environmental challenge, underscoring the urgent need for adopting innovative strategies that will address its management and utilization. At the same time, the growing demand for sustainable energy storage materials necessitates the exploration of resourceful solutions including advanced plastic-based materials. Addressing these dual concerns, this review examines the transformation of waste plastics into functional nanocarbons (FNCs) for energy-related applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of zero-to-three-dimensional FNCs derived from waste plastics, detailing synthesis techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, pyrolysis/catalytic pyrolysis, and hydrothermal carbonization, along with the underlying mechanisms. Key factors influencing the conversion process—including pressure, temperature, and catalytic systems—are thoroughly examined. Discussions on morphology and surface chemistry shed light on strategies to optimize material properties for specific applications. Special attention is given to the performance of FNCs in supercapacitors and batteries, using benchmarks such as electrical conductivity, specific surface area, and cycling stability to evaluate their suitability for energy storage. Additionally, the review incorporates a circular economic perspective, offering insights into how upcycling waste plastics into FNCs can contribute to a more sustainable future. It identifies critical research gaps, evaluates the environmental impacts of these processes, and highlights promising opportunities for innovation. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and bridging knowledge gaps, this review aims to inspire advancements in both waste plastic upcycling and energy technologies, ultimately contributing to sustainable solutions for urgent environmental and energy challenges.
