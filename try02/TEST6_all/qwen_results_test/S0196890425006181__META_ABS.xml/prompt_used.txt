You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodeoxygenation of biomass pyrolysis oil towards renewable bio-gasoline production: Economic and environmental optimization based on a machine learning framework Hydrodeoxygenation is a critical upgrading step that converts biomass pyrolysis oil into renewable transportation fuels. A more intense degree of pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation can enhance fuel properties but may increase cost. This study proposes a coupled process simulation and machine learning optimization framework that systematically integrates the pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation stages to achieve coordinated optimization across fuel quality, economic performance, and carbon emissions. An integrated learning model was developed, showing superior predictive accuracy over other algorithms, with the best model reaching a mean relative error of 5.8 % and a coefficient of determination of 0.96. Shapley Additive Explanations analysis identified pyrolysis temperature, hydrogenation temperature, and solvent type as key variables influencing bio-oil quality. Under economic optimization, the best conditions yielded a higher heating value of 48.26 MJ/kg, carbon content of 86.66 %, and hydrogen pressure of 3 MPa. For carbon reduction, the optimal setup achieved higher heating value of 34.26 MJ/kg, carbon content of 81.63 %, and CO2 savings of 4.09 gCO2eq. These outcomes, obtained through particle swarm optimization, highlight parameter combinations that balance performance with sustainability. This study offers an integrated pathway combining modelling, interpretation, and optimization to guide high-quality bio-oil system design and reveal trade-offs among fuel quality, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions.
