Hydrodeoxygenation of biomass pyrolysis oil towards renewable bio-gasoline production: Economic and environmental optimization based on a machine learning framework Hydrodeoxygenation is a critical upgrading step that converts biomass pyrolysis oil into renewable transportation fuels. A more intense degree of pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation can enhance fuel properties but may increase cost. This study proposes a coupled process simulation and machine learning optimization framework that systematically integrates the pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation stages to achieve coordinated optimization across fuel quality, economic performance, and carbon emissions. An integrated learning model was developed, showing superior predictive accuracy over other algorithms, with the best model reaching a mean relative error of 5.8 % and a coefficient of determination of 0.96. Shapley Additive Explanations analysis identified pyrolysis temperature, hydrogenation temperature, and solvent type as key variables influencing bio-oil quality. Under economic optimization, the best conditions yielded a higher heating value of 48.26 MJ/kg, carbon content of 86.66 %, and hydrogen pressure of 3 MPa. For carbon reduction, the optimal setup achieved higher heating value of 34.26 MJ/kg, carbon content of 81.63 %, and CO2 savings of 4.09 gCO2eq. These outcomes, obtained through particle swarm optimization, highlight parameter combinations that balance performance with sustainability. This study offers an integrated pathway combining modelling, interpretation, and optimization to guide high-quality bio-oil system design and reveal trade-offs among fuel quality, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions.
