You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic Microwave-Assisted Co-Pyrolysis of soybean husk and HDPE: Optimization, Kinetics, and enhanced bio-oil production using ZSM-5 Soybean husk (SH), a readily available agricultural residue, holds promise as a sustainable feedstock for biofuel production. Its abundance and potential for efficient conversion via pyrolysis make it particularly promising in renewable energy applications. The primary results of this study demonstrate that adding the ZSM-5 catalyst reduces the mean activation energy (Ea) from 209 to 187 kJ/mol, thereby facilitating the pyrolysis process. The bio-oil composition analysis revealed that the catalyst promoted the formation of cyclic hydrocarbons, increasing their proportion from 26 % to 53 %. When High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) was added, most of the products generated were hydrocarbons, ranging from 78 % to 93 %. Additionally, an increase in pyrolysis temperature results in a decrease in phenolic compounds, highlighting the catalyst’s role in deoxygenation reaction and enhancing bio-oil quality. Optimization studies indicated that a SH to HDPE mass ratio of 3.3 and a temperature of 539 °C maximized bio-oil production during the co-pyrolysis process. However, reuse and regeneration tests reveal a decline in the catalyst’s performance after successive runs, as indicated by a reduced surface area of the catalyst, lower hydrocarbon content, and increased phenolic composition. This suggests that additional treatment during catalyst regeneration is necessary to maintain bio-oil quality. These findings underscore the potential for the use of agricultural waste and waste plastics in co-pyrolysis to produce valuable pyrolytic products. These results suggest opportunities for large-scale applications and further optimization studies.
