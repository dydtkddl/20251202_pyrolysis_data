2nd generation PLA; Lactide formation directly from aqueous lactic acid In order to develop a 2nd generation polylactic acid (PLA) process, lactide (LD) was synthesized directly from a commercially available 90% aqueous lactic acid (LA) solution. Experiments were conducted in an ordinary continuous flow fixed bed reactor. The reaction was carried out over various zeolites and γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Furthermore, the influence of pressure, temperature and water content in the inlet was studied. The highest LD selectivity of 98.9% was obtained using 90% LA and γ-Al2O3 as catalyst. In addition, it is concluded that LD yield increases when using highly concentrated LA oligomer with a minor amount of water. The catalysts were characterized by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption isotherms (BET), temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and pyridine Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR).
