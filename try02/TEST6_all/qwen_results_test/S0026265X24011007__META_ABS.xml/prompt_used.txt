You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Raman imaging spectroscopic solutions for microplastics advanced analysis: Insights from Choqueyapu river basin (La Paz, Bolivia) Microplastics (MPs) are causing global concern due to their role as vectors of environmental contaminants. Evaluating their impact on environmental compartments, particularly in sediment and freshwaters, remains challenging due to difficulties in gathering chemical and morphological data. In fact, the analytical process can vary depending on the matrix considered, the non-homogeneous characteristics of MPs, and the targeted size range. Sample treatment is crucial for sediments and waters, requiring a balance between matrix removal and preservation of the MPs. Consequently, MPs often remain embedded in significant amounts of the original matrices, compromising their characterisation. In this regard, Raman spectroscopy shows promise for their comprehensive molecular analysis. However, overcoming the drawbacks associated with fluorescence from organic matter, feldspar, or clays requires considerable effort. Effective signal acquisition necessitates fine-tuning parameters, including background reduction and signal-to-noise ratio amplification. Moreover, data handling involved in chemical scanning large surfaces at high resolution is a challenging task. To overcome these drawbacks, chemometrics have demonstrated high efficacy in processing and extracting targeted information. The application of chemometrics could be relevant in environmental studies due to the large number of samples, the complexity of signal acquisition, and the dataset volumes managed. As such, this study proposes spectroscopic analytical solutions, augmented by chemical imaging and algorithmic processing, for advanced MPs analysis. A spectroscopic working approach was devised and tested through a real case study conducted in the Choqueyapu River basin (La Paz, Bolivia). This methodology allowed the morphological, molecular and quantitative identification of over 44 particles/L and 91 MPs particles/kg, in water and sediment, respectively, consisting of PE, PET, PP, PS and PMMA. MP abundance varied significantly across studied areas, spanning 2 to 4 orders of magnitude. PET fibres predominated in freshwaters, while Lipari Sector sediments were hotspots for PE and PS fragments.
