You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient water disinfection against antibiotic-resistant bacteria by visible-light heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like process with atomically dispersed Cu on graphitic carbon nitride as the catalyst Waterborne microbial contamination poses significant environmental and health risks. Photocatalytic heterogeneous Fenton and Fenton-like processes can offer efficient pathogen removal, with benefits in recycling, solid–liquid separation, and byproduct avoidance. However, their low reaction efficiency and slow kinetics for low-valence metal regeneration are limitations. This study addresses these challenges by incorporating atomically dispersed Cu onto graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) as a single-atom catalyst (SAC). The Cu atoms are stabilized by pyridinic N atoms through coordination, forming Cu-N4 catalytic sites that enhance photogenerated charge carrier transfer. This leads to a more efficient synergistic photocatalytic-Fenton-like reaction, generating more hydroxyl radicals and achieving effective water disinfection. Results show a 7-log bacterial inactivation of antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii within 8 min, surpassing prior photocatalytic-Fenton-like disinfection systems. Density functional theory calculations confirm improved hydrogen peroxide adsorption, electron transport, and electron-hole separation in the Cu-N4 structure. The catalyst’s durability and stability were demonstrated through extensive cycling experiments, ion interference tests, and disinfection trials in various water matrices. Additionally, the Cu-SAC@CN catalyst, loaded onto a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, achieved a 99% bacterial eradication rate within 20 min. This study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of heterogeneous photocatalytic-Fenton-like systems for efficient eradication of waterborne bacteria.
