Pyrolysis of rubber wastes in heavy oils and use of the products Thermal treatment, principally pyrolysis processes, appears useful as a means of managing waste tyres. In the present work, an original process, called “thermolysis”, is described, both on a laboratory scale and as a development unit. It is based on liquid-solid pyrolysis carried out in a solvent medium at relatively low temperatures, ca. 380°C, where the solvent dissolves the degradation oligomers within a few minutes. The developmental unit scales-up the laboratory experiments. Material balances and product characterizations are presented. Products include: a combustible gas, liquid, and an oil—carbon-black suspension, which is the major product and which can be used in rubber formulations. Properties of rubber specimens prepared with this suspension are reported.
