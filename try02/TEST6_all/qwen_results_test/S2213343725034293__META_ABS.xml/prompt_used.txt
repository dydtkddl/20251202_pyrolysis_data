You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potassium ferrate catalyzed microwave pyrolysis: Efficiently improving bio-oil quality and heavy metals immobilization A hierarchical catalytic system for one-step sludge valorization integrates K2FeO4-enhanced microwave pyrolysis, synergistically optimizing bio-oil quality and heavy metals (HMs) immobilization through combined alkaline activation and iron-based catalysis. During the pretreatment process, KOH from K2FeO4 hydrolysis activated biomass and promoted the development of a porous biochar. Meanwhile, Fe(OH)3 decomposed into Fe2O3 during microwave pyrolysis to catalyze the decomposition of organic matter, thus improving the quality of bio-oil. When the K2FeO4 addition was increased to 10 %, the yield of bio-oil rose from 28.94 wt% to 30.72 wt%, and the hydrocarbon content increased from 19.59 % to 27.55 %. The alkaline conditions formed by the hydrolysis of K2FeO4 also promoted the development of porous biochar, thus increasing the specific surface area from 28.5 m2/g to 42.632 m2/g thereby improving HMs immobilization. Besides, the SiO3 2- from pretreatment process could react with HMs to form stable silicates during pyrolysis, reducing the leaching of HMs. This synergistic effect of metal silicates and hierarchical pores achieved high immobilization rates of Zn (91.2 %), Cu (85.7 %), and Ni (91.33 %). This work provides a rapid, low-cost and environmentally friendly approach for the sludge resource utilization.
