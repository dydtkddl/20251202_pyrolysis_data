Potassium ferrate catalyzed microwave pyrolysis: Efficiently improving bio-oil quality and heavy metals immobilization A hierarchical catalytic system for one-step sludge valorization integrates K2FeO4-enhanced microwave pyrolysis, synergistically optimizing bio-oil quality and heavy metals (HMs) immobilization through combined alkaline activation and iron-based catalysis. During the pretreatment process, KOH from K2FeO4 hydrolysis activated biomass and promoted the development of a porous biochar. Meanwhile, Fe(OH)3 decomposed into Fe2O3 during microwave pyrolysis to catalyze the decomposition of organic matter, thus improving the quality of bio-oil. When the K2FeO4 addition was increased to 10 %, the yield of bio-oil rose from 28.94 wt% to 30.72 wt%, and the hydrocarbon content increased from 19.59 % to 27.55 %. The alkaline conditions formed by the hydrolysis of K2FeO4 also promoted the development of porous biochar, thus increasing the specific surface area from 28.5 m2/g to 42.632 m2/g thereby improving HMs immobilization. Besides, the SiO3 2- from pretreatment process could react with HMs to form stable silicates during pyrolysis, reducing the leaching of HMs. This synergistic effect of metal silicates and hierarchical pores achieved high immobilization rates of Zn (91.2 %), Cu (85.7 %), and Ni (91.33 %). This work provides a rapid, low-cost and environmentally friendly approach for the sludge resource utilization.
