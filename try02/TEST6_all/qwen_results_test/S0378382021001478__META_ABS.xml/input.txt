Particle formation during suspension combustion of different biomass powders and their fast pyrolysis bio-oils and biochars The fly ash formation during suspension combustion of five different biomass powders (stem wood, bark, forest residue, willow, and reed canary grass) and the corresponding products from fast pyrolysis (bio-oil and biochar) of the powders was investigated. The fifteen fuels were burned in a drop tube furnace under normal (20 vol-% O2) and oxygen-enriched combustion conditions (40 vol-% and 60 vol-% O2). The trends in the data were used to discuss differences in combustion behavior and devise recommendations for the use of the fuels. There was a general difference in fly ash formation mechanism between the solid fuels (biomass and biochar) and the bio-oil fuels, which was attributed to parts of the ash-forming elements in bio-oil being dissolved in the oil. Oxygen-enrichment did not affect the release of inorganic elements to the gas phase for bio-oil combustion. Since the bio-oils generate lower fly ash during combustion, ~100 times compared to the original biomasses, they should be reserved for combustion technologies demanding fuels with very low ash content, whereas the biochar should be used in large scale combustion facilities with advanced gas cleaning technology operated by teams with experience of handling ash related operational problems.
