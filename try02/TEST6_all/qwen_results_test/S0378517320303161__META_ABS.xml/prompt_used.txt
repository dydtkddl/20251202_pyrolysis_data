You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Leachables from plastic materials in contact with drugs. State of the art and review of current analytical approaches The plastics used in drug packaging systems and medical devices are composed of homologous polymers and generally contain additives such as antioxidants, plasticizers and others, to improve their physicochemical properties. However, these additives have potential drawbacks due to possible migration or leaching towards the drug product. Leaching can cause a change in the chemical composition of the drug which, in turn, could modify its therapeutic action and, in some cases, its organoleptic properties. Leachables may also be considered a health hazard due to their inherent toxicological properties. The analytical characterization (detection, identification, typification/qualification and quantification) of leachable substances is mandatory and this information must be included in the application dossier for the drug before it can receive regulatory approval. The main aim of this paper is to collect and contextualise the reported analytical approaches for characterising and/or controlling organic leachables from plastic materials in contact with drugs. We also describe the state of the art of leachables in conjunction with a valuable, broad-based compilation of directives and guidelines. We end by presenting an updated collection of leachables both gas and liquid chromatography studies as separation techniques over the last eight years. We decided to focus our review exclusively on organic leachables as there is already a wide body of research on inorganic impurities.
