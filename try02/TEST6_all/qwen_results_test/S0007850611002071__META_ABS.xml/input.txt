Laser nano-manufacturing – State of the art and challenges This paper provides an overview of advances in laser based nano-manufacturing technologies including surface nano-structure manufacturing, production of nano materials (nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanowires) and 3D nano-structures manufacture through multiple layer additive techniques and nano-joining/forming. Examples of practical applications of laser manufactured nano-structures, materials and components are given. A discussion on the challenges and outlooks in laser nano-manufacturing is presented.
