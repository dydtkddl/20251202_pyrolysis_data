You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of activated biochar derived from Washingtonia robusta palm seeds and evaluation of its viability for copper and zinc ions removal from contaminated water Addressing the environmental menace posed by substantial quantities of pollutants continually discharged without prior treatment presents a critical challenge for scientists and experts. This work is showcasing the production of activated biochar (WRAB) derived from Washingtonia robusta (WR) palm seeds and its application in the removal of Cu (II) and Zn (II) ions from aqueous solutions. Our investigation into WRAB synthesis reveals optimal experimental conditions, with an impregnation ratio of approximately 3/1 (w/w) for H3PO4 acid-to-WR seeds ratio, coupled with a pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C. Experimental characterization revealed a substantial removal efficiency, with 97 % and 94 % removal of Cu (II) and Zn (II) ions. The adsorption investigation confirmed the suitability of the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models in accurately describing the removal kinetics and isotherms of the tested ions. These findings highlight the potential of the synthesized WRAB as an efficacious alternative to commercially available adsorbents for the large-scale adsorption of cationic ions from contaminated wastewater.
