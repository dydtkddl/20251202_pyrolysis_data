Synthesis of activated biochar derived from Washingtonia robusta palm seeds and evaluation of its viability for copper and zinc ions removal from contaminated water Addressing the environmental menace posed by substantial quantities of pollutants continually discharged without prior treatment presents a critical challenge for scientists and experts. This work is showcasing the production of activated biochar (WRAB) derived from Washingtonia robusta (WR) palm seeds and its application in the removal of Cu (II) and Zn (II) ions from aqueous solutions. Our investigation into WRAB synthesis reveals optimal experimental conditions, with an impregnation ratio of approximately 3/1 (w/w) for H3PO4 acid-to-WR seeds ratio, coupled with a pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C. Experimental characterization revealed a substantial removal efficiency, with 97 % and 94 % removal of Cu (II) and Zn (II) ions. The adsorption investigation confirmed the suitability of the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models in accurately describing the removal kinetics and isotherms of the tested ions. These findings highlight the potential of the synthesized WRAB as an efficacious alternative to commercially available adsorbents for the large-scale adsorption of cationic ions from contaminated wastewater.
