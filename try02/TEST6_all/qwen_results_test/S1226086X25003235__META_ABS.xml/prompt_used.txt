You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Specialized fractionation combined with deep analytics of waste plastic cracking oils for petrochemical operations Waste plastic cracking oils (WPCO) are currently being considered as potential green feedstock for petrochemical/refinery industries in order to promote chemical recycling. However, the WPCO is a very complex material that does not meet the limits of petrochemical processes. In order to assess the possibility of using WPCO as raw material, a comprehensive analytical characterization and distillation of two wide-boiling WPCO samples from the industry was performed. Fractions boiling in typical ranges were prepared: naphtha (30–180 °C), heavy naphtha (30–250 °C), middle distillate (180–350 °C), and atmospheric residue (> 350 °C). Moreover, other distillation cuts were prepared by distilling every 10 wt% as a separate fraction. We performed a study on the distribution of parameters in narrow fractions. The content of aromatics increased with the boiling temperature in the cases of WPCO-1, but decreased for WPCO-2. WPCO-2 had lower alkanes and final boiling point (FBP) compared to WPCO-1. None of the distillation cuts are suitable for “stand-alone” processing on the steam-cracker without additional treatment. However, some of the obtained fractions could be co-processed with a standard feedstock. This study brings an understanding of WPCO material and the possibilities and limitations of its use as petrochemical input.
