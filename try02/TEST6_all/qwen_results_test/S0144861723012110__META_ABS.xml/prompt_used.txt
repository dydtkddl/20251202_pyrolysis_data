You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Order matters: Methods for extracting cellulose from rice straw by coupling alkaline, ozone and enzymatic treatments Rice straw is a widely produced residue that can be converted into value-added products. This work aimed at using greener processes combining mild alkali (A), ozone (O) and enzymatic (engineered xylanase) (E) treatments to extract cellulose and other value-added compounds from rice straw and to evaluate the effects of the order of the treatments. Solid (S) and liquid (L) fractions from the process were collected for physicochemical characterization. AOE treatment showed the best capacity to extract high purity cellulose and other valuable compounds. The lignin content was significantly decreased independently of the order of the treatments and, its content in the extract obtained after the AOE process was lower than the one obtained after the OAE process. Moreover, thermal stability of the samples increased after the enzymatic process, being higher in SAOE. The alkaline treatment increased the hemicellulose and polyphenol content (antioxidant activity) in the liquid fractions (LA and LOA). In contrast, the ozonized liquid fractions had lower polyphenol content. Therefore, alkali was fundamental in the process. In conclusion, the AOE strategy could be a more environmentally friendly method for extracting cellulose and other valuable compounds, which could be used to develop active materials in the future.
