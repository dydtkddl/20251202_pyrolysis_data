Optimization study of waste gasification performance based on centrifuge plasma gasification technology This study systematically optimized operational parameters of a plasma gasifier for waste treatment to improve gasification efficiency and syngas yield. Key parameters such as CO2 ratio, steam-to-CO2 ratio, inlet gas flow rate, and centrifuge speed were varied to assess gasification performance. Optimal performance was found at a CO2 ratio of 0.1, steam-to-CO2 ratio of 1.0, inlet gas flow ratio of 1.0, and centrifuge speed of 200 rpm. Under these conditions, syngas concentration reached 0.645, with 0.333H2, 0.294 CO, and 0.018 CH4. Carbon conversion rate was 63.99%, cold gas efficiency was 71.77%, and equivalence ratio was 0.2. The study showed that optimal centrifuge speed improved waste contact with the high-temperature region, accelerating gasification, and uniform heat distribution optimized the reaction process. Steam addition increased H2 concentration, while controlled CO2 introduction improved CO production efficiency. The centrifuge-enhanced plasma gasifier showed superior gasification and energy efficiency compared to other designs, indicating its broad application potential.
