Plastic-waste hydrogenolysis over two-dimensional MXene-supported ruthenium catalysts with tunable interlayer spacing The hydrogenolysis of plastics is limited by active-site inaccessibility and inefficient mass transport of bulky polymer chains. To overcome these challenges, this work developed two-dimensional MXene-supported Ru (Ru@MXene) catalysts. Lyophilization of a solution containing dispersed MXene sheets and Ru precursors enabled the confinement of Ru species within the MXene interlayers, which act as pillars to expand the interlayer spacing. Building on this, a silica-pillared MXene-supported Ru (Ru@P-MXene) with even larger interlayer spacing exhibited a reaction rate of 914.9 gC5–C35 gRu −1 h−1 for the hydrogenolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable liquid chemicals (e.g., C5–C35). A comparison of product yields between Ru@P-MXene and Ru@MXene suggests that elongated Ru particles confined within the MXene support expose their side facets for the reaction. This work demonstrates a new application of MXene in thermochemical catalysis, offering a solution to the challenges of active-site accessibility, mass transport, and reaction confinement in chemical plastic upcycling.
