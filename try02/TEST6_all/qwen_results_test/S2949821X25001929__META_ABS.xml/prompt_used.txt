You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling plastic waste into advanced carbon materials: A comprehensive review of applications in energy and environment This review highlights upcycling, a promising strategy transforming diverse plastic streams into high-value carbon-based materials. The escalating global accumulation of plastic waste, currently at over 400 million tonnes annually, demands a fundamental shift from a linear take-make-dispose model to a circular economy. The manuscript synthesizes advancements (2020–2025) in converting major plastic types: Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polystyrene (PS), and Polyethylene (PE) into functional carbons like Graphene (GNs), Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), Activated Carbons (ACs), Carbon Nanosheets (CNS), and Disordered Hard Carbon (HC). These materials show remarkable potential. In energy storage, they enhance supercapacitors and batteries. For catalysis, they serve as efficient electrocatalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), and aid in photocatalytic and Fenton-like degradation. They are also effective in environmental remediation via adsorption and electrochemical treatment and contribute to advanced material synthesis. Their integration into emerging technologies, including Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) and Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs), expands their utility. Initial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies confirm their environmental benefits, demonstrating reductions in climate change potential and human toxicity. Future research should prioritize precision material design, multi-functional hybrids (e.g., carbon integrated with metal oxides), and advanced in-situ characterization to understand structure-property relationships. Developing scalable, energy-efficient processes through techno-economic analysis and modeling is crucial. Diversifying applications and ensuring holistic sustainability via Social LCA (S-LCA) and policy frameworks will accelerate the transition to a sustainable-circular economy.
