You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multiscale modeling and simulation on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene (ODHE) by Pt-based catalysts is a complex reaction involving endothermic dehydrogenation reactions occurring in gas and exothermic oxidation reactions occurring on the catalyst surface. It is a challenge to figure out its reaction mechanism. Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method was employed to analyze 82 possible elementary reactions on Pt/Al2O3. The path of CH3-CH3 * →CH3-CH2 * →CH3-CH* →C2H4 * on the catalyst surface and the cracking of ethane in the gas phase were the main pathways for ethylene formation, which both needed heat supply. The step of C* +O* →CO* was the main oxidation path providing heat, with C* from C-C bond breaking or dehydrogenation of CHx species. The result was used to establish a particle-resolved fixed-bed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The autothermal equilibrium was achieved at an inlet temperature of 773 K, a flow rate of 2 m/s, and a molar ratio (C2H6:O2) of 3:1. Besides, the oxidation reaction was enhanced by increasing the inlet molar ratio, which meant that the C* species increased. The inlet velocity strengthened the heat transfer and a higher inlet velocity resulted in a lower bed temperature. The multi-scale simulation results can provide a reference for the design of an ethylene industrial reactor.
