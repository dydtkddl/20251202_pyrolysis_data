You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fatigue investigation of 3D-printed notched PLA specimens by Thermographic methods with FEM Simulation Integration Additive manufacturing (AM) technology, particularly for polymers, as versatile technology, becomes increasingly important in various fields, especially in medical and healthcare. The wide usage of 3D printed parts and layer-by-layer nature of them introduces unique considerations for potential fatigue-related issues, therefore, fatigue crack propagation and material failure are significant concerns when it comes to the long-term performance and reliability of such components. In this context, thermography can help identify areas of localized heating that could indicate the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks. Energy Methods are time-efficient and requires fewer specimens compared to conventional fatigue testing methods which can provide valuable insights to the design and printing parameters to enhance the fatigue performance. In this research, after modelling different types notched dog-bone specimens, they were printed with FDM printer using PLA material and similar setting parameters. After that, 3D printed specimens were subjected to static tensile loading and stepwise fatigue tests monitoring the energy release to assess their fatigue behaviour. Additionally, we employed ACP module in Ansys to model notched specimens, calculating stresses within different layers.
