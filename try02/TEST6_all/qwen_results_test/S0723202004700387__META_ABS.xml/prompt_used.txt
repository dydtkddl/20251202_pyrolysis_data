You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Identity and Potential Functions of Heterotrophic Bacterial Isolates from a Continuous-Upflow Fixed-Bed Reactor for Denitrification of Drinking Water with Bacterial Polyester as Source of Carbon and Electron Donor A collection of 186 heterotrophic bacteria, isolated directly from a continuous-upflow fixed-bed reactor for the denitrification of drinking water, in which poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) granules acted as biofilm carrier, carbon source and electron donor, was studied with regard to taxonomic affiliation and degradation and denitrification characteristics. Two granule samples were taken from a fully operating reactor for enumeration and isolation of heterotrophic bacteria. One sample was drawn from the lower part of the reactor, near the oxic zone, and the other sample from the upper, anoxic part of the fixed bed. Dominant colonies were isolated and the cultures were identified using fatty acid analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing. Their ability to degrade the polymer and 3-hydroxybutyrate and to denitrify in pure culture was assessed. The results show that high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria were present in the biofilms on the polymer granules, with marked differences in taxonomic composition and potential functions between the lower and upper part of the fixed bed. The majority of the isolates were Gram negative bacteria, and most of them were able to reduce nitrate to nitrite or to denitrify, and to utilize 3-hydroxybutyrate as sole source of carbon. Only two groups, one identified as Acidovorax facilis and the other phylogenetically related to Brevundimonas intermedia, could combine denitrification and utilization of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), and were found only in the upper sample. The other groups occurred either in the lower or upper part, or in both samples. They were assigned to Brevundimonas, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Achromobacter, or Phyllobacterium, or were phylogenetically related to Afipia or Stenotrophomonas.
