Performance evaluation of a novel two-stage waste wood gasifier: Influence of steam-to-biomass ratio and in-situ steam generation on tar formation The shift from high-quality woodchips to low-quality feedstocks increasingly shapes biomass gasification. Small- to medium-scale plants face challenges from heterogeneous feedstock and tar formation, with a research gap in producing energetically useable product gas without extensive cleaning. This study investigates gasification of different waste wood fractions in a two-stage process using a novel bubbling fluidised bed reactor without bed material. Two steam generation strategies were applied: steam-saturated air and direct water injection. Combining secondary air with steam-saturated primary air improved temperature control, reduced slagging, and ensured stable thermal stratification across feed rates. While raising the steam-to-biomass ratio did not significantly enhance efficiency, it strongly reduced tar: PAH16 and BTX decreased by up to 85% and 65%. Gas composition showed slight increases in H2 and CH4, a decrease in CO, and stable values for heating value, gas yield, and conversion efficiency. The product gas exhibited an LHV of 3.7-4.2MJNm−3, gas yields of 1.9-2.8Nm3kg−1, and cold gas efficiencies of 52.5-57.8%, comparable to values reported for high-quality woodchips. Total tar concentrations remained low (0.92-2.8gNm−3), demonstrating that autothermal operation with controlled secondary air and steam-saturated primary air provides both efficient energy recovery and effective tar reduction, even for low-quality feedstocks.
