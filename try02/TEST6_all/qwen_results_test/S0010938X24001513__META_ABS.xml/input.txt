Detrimental effect of high-productivity L-PBF parameters on metal dusting resistance of Inconel 625 The effect of increased productivity in L-PBF manufacturing on the metal dusting resistance of Inconel 625 was studied at 610 °C. Two sets of processing parameters were tested: the standard parameters given by the machine manufacturer and degraded parameters with increased scan speed and hatching distance. The materials obtained with degraded parameters presented numerous lacks of fusion at the surface and exhibited significantly shorter incubation times before corrosion. Carburisation was preferentially localised around the defects where the oxide scale was less protective and where the confinement of the atmosphere could result in an increase of the local carbon activity.
