Release and Transformation Characteristics of Arsenic during Coal Pyrolysis and Gasification Pyrolysis and gasification experiments of bituminous coal (Yunnan Zhenxiong) have been conducted in a high frequency furnace reactor to investigate the distinction of release and transformation of arsenic at two different stages decoupled from integrated gasification. The results indicate that the release rate of arsenic changes significantly with increasing temperature and holding time during gasification when compared with pyrolysis. Escape of volatiles accounts for the release of arsenic during pyrolysis, while the promotion of migration during gasification is attributed to the carbon conversion and minerals melting. Arsenic in char derived from pyrolysis and gasification mainly presents as forms bound to residues and sulfides, and fraction of extractable form of arsenic from gasified char is higher than that from pyrolysis char.
