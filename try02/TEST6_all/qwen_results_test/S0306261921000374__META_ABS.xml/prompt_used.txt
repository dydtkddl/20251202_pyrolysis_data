You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification of high-density polyethylene and pretreated pine wood Co-gasification of biomass and plastic blends has been extensively studied, however the effect of AAEMs (alkali and alkaline earth metals) in biomass on the co-gasification behavior still remains unknown. Acid and alkali pretreatment were used here to remove or introduce the AAEMs in biomass by ion-exchange method. SEM was used to obtain morphological characteristics of three pretreated pine wood (PW) samples; TG analysis of pure and blend feedstocks was used to examine the decomposition behavior. CO2 assisted co-gasification of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and pretreated PW samples at different blend ratios were conducted in a fixed bed reactor, and the resulting flow rate and yields of H2, CO, light hydrocarbons (HC), total syngas, and output energy determined. Synergetic effects from these blends during co-gasification were evaluated by comparing the experimental results with the weighted results from individual components. Results showed that the presence of AAEMs in biomass resulted in increased char yield and char reactivity, that enhanced the syngas yield and energy output. However, acid pretreatment with low AAEM content showed the opposite trend. Irrespective of the biomass pretreatment, synergistic effect was found in the yield of each syngas component, total syngas, and energy yield during its co-gasification with HDPE plastic. The synergy during co-gasification of HDPE and alkali treated PW was more pronounced at high PW content, while those from acid pretreatment preferred low PW fraction. The highest energy yields of 28.1, 34.3 and 30.1 kJ/g were obtained from co-gasification of HDPE and water, acid and alkali pretreated PW samples at PW fraction of 44%, 22% and 55%, respectively. Maximum synergistic effect with energy yield of 69% was obtained from the gasification of HDPE and acid pretreated PW at 27% PW fraction. These results help to our understanding of the influence of biomass pretreatment on co-gasification of biomass-plastic mixtures. The results also help to achieve relatively stable energy output for varying mixtures of plastic and biomass.
