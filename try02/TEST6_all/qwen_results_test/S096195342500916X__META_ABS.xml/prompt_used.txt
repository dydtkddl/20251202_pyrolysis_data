You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-objective optimization of key reaction parameters over La-Ni based perovskite catalyzed CO2 biomass gasification based on response surface methodology and an integrated strategy CO2 biomass catalytic gasification is a promising sustainable energy technology with significant potential for reducing global carbon emissions. This study investigated the multi-objective optimization of modified La-Ni based perovskite catalysts for CO2 coconut shell gasification. An integrated optimization strategy combining Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), K-means clustering, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was employed to identify optimal gasification decisions. RSM was used to analyze complex interactions among key parameters (Temperature, flow rate, CO2 concentration, and catalyst loading) and establish predictive models, while NSGA-II generated 85 Pareto-optimal solutions. K-means clustering was employed to grouped the solutions into 5 groups based on features to preserve decision diversity, and TOPSIS ranked them according to their closeness to an ideal solution. Under the optimal gasification conditions, CO yields ranged from 1514.93 mL/g to 2200.56 mL/g, H2 yields from 433.18 mL/g to 479.77 mL/g, and carbon conversion rates from 91.08 % to 96.08 %, exceeding common benchmarks in similar studies. The integrated strategy improves solution diversity, interpretability, and decision-making accuracy compared to traditional single algorithm approaches. This work demonstrates both the optimal catalytic efficiency of the synthesized perovskite and the application of integrated optimization strategy in advancing CO2 biomass gasification.
