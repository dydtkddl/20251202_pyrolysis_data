You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal cracking of free fatty acids in inert and light hydrocarbon gas atmospheres The aim of this work was to study the pyrolytic conversion of free fatty acids to renewable hydrocarbons in the presence of short-chain alkane and alkene hydrocarbon gases. Oleic acid (cis-9-octadecanoic acid) was used as model for fatty acids produced from hydrolysis of lipids from animal and plant feedstock. Batch pyrolysis reactions were conducted at 410°C for 2h at an initial pressure between 130psi (896.3kPa) and 500psi (3447.4kPa) under constant agitation. Identification and quantification of the pyrolysates in the gas and liquid phase were carried out using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Under inert N2 atmosphere liquid product yields were between 74 and 81wt% of feed with lower pressure giving the highest product yields. Liquid product was composed mainly of alkanes and alkenes ranging in carbon number from 6 to 19 and fatty acids from carbon numbers 4 to 18. Pyrolysis reactions conducted in the presence of short-chain alkane gases did not appreciably influence the liquid product yield and the composition compared to the inert atmosphere. On the other hand, pyrolysis reaction in presence of short-chain alkene gases resulted in a marked increase in the liquid product yield, the production of branched alkanes and alkenes and increased fatty acid decarboxylation. This work demonstrates a novel approach to concurrently increase the liquid product yield in pyrolysis of free fatty acids and produce highly valuable branched hydrocarbons for fuel and solvent applications.
