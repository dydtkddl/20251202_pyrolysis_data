Current trends in biochar application for catalytic conversion of biomass to biofuels Under the circumstances of serious environmental challenges and energy crises, it is of utmost importance to produce fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass and organic wastes. Biochar as a bioproduct from thermochemical conversion of biomass has attracted exponential research interest in recent years due to the abundance of its precursor (biomass resources) and its adaptability in different chemical reaction systems. Undoubtedly, it is essential to attain an in-depth understanding of the physiochemical properties and functionalization of biochar catalysts to further improve their catalytic activity, selectivity and stability in the reactions. However, until now, only a few reports are accessible on the use of biochar as a catalytic support material and/or a standalone catalyst in thermochemical biomass conversion to produce high-quality biofuels. Thus, the key objective of this review article is to summarize and discuss the latest progress in biochar production, modification, activation and functionalization by understanding its physical chemistry, composition and application in catalytic processes. This review article provides insights into the thermochemical and hydrothermal production of biochar as well as the engineering and process optimization aspects for value-added biofuel production and decarbonization.
