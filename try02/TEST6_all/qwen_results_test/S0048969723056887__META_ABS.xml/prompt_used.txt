You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dry torrefaction and continuous thermochemical conversion for upgrading agroforestry waste into eco-friendly energy carriers: Current progress and future prospect Agroforestry Waste (AW) is seen as a carbon neutral resource. However, the poor quality of AW reduced its potential application value. Even more unfortunately, chlorine in AW led to the formation of organic pollutants such as dioxins under higher temperatures. Alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in ash may deepen the reaction degree. Co-pretreatment of dry torrefaction and de-ashing followed by thermochemical conversion is a promising technology, which can improve raw material quality, inhibit the release of organic pollutants and transform AW into eco-friendly energy carriers. In order to better understand the process, theoretical basis such as the structural characteristics, thermal properties and separation methods of structural components of AW are described in detail. In addition, dry torrefaction related reactors, process parameters, kinetic analysis models as well as the evaluation methods of torrefaction degree and environmental impact are systematically reviewed. The problem of ash accumulation caused by dry torrefaction can be well solved by de-ashing pretreatment. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion on the role of the two- and three-stage conversion technologies around dry torrefacion, de-ashing pretreatment and thermochemical conversion in products quality enhancement. Finally, the existing technical challenges, including suppression of gaseous pollutant release, harmless treatment and reuse of torrefaction liquid product (TPL) and reduction of torrefaction operating costs, are summarized and evaluated. The future research directions, such as vitrification of the reused TPL (after de-ashing or acid catalysis) and integration of oxidative torrefaction with thermochemical conversion technologies, are proposed.
