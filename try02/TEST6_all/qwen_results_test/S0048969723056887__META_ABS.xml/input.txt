Dry torrefaction and continuous thermochemical conversion for upgrading agroforestry waste into eco-friendly energy carriers: Current progress and future prospect Agroforestry Waste (AW) is seen as a carbon neutral resource. However, the poor quality of AW reduced its potential application value. Even more unfortunately, chlorine in AW led to the formation of organic pollutants such as dioxins under higher temperatures. Alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in ash may deepen the reaction degree. Co-pretreatment of dry torrefaction and de-ashing followed by thermochemical conversion is a promising technology, which can improve raw material quality, inhibit the release of organic pollutants and transform AW into eco-friendly energy carriers. In order to better understand the process, theoretical basis such as the structural characteristics, thermal properties and separation methods of structural components of AW are described in detail. In addition, dry torrefaction related reactors, process parameters, kinetic analysis models as well as the evaluation methods of torrefaction degree and environmental impact are systematically reviewed. The problem of ash accumulation caused by dry torrefaction can be well solved by de-ashing pretreatment. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion on the role of the two- and three-stage conversion technologies around dry torrefacion, de-ashing pretreatment and thermochemical conversion in products quality enhancement. Finally, the existing technical challenges, including suppression of gaseous pollutant release, harmless treatment and reuse of torrefaction liquid product (TPL) and reduction of torrefaction operating costs, are summarized and evaluated. The future research directions, such as vitrification of the reused TPL (after de-ashing or acid catalysis) and integration of oxidative torrefaction with thermochemical conversion technologies, are proposed.
