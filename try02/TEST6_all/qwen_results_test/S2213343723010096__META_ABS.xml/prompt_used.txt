You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biocomposite of hydrochar and Lindnera jadinii with magnetic properties for adsorptive removal of cadmium ions The aim of the work was to check the possibility of obtaining a biocomposite with magnetic properties capable of removing cadmium ions from aqueous solutions. The biocomposite consists of hydrochar obtained by hydrothermal carbonization of raffia fibers, Lindnera jadinii yeast and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The obtained biocomposite was characterized by SEM, FTIR, VSM, XRD, TGA and BET analysis. The study examined the effect of sorption time, initial concentration of cadmium ions, temperature, the pHZPC and the reusability of the biocomposite. Based on the obtained results, non-linear equilibrium and kinetic models were selected. The equilibrium model with the highest matching factor describing the sorption of Cd(II) by the bionanocomposite was the Temkin isotherm model R2 = 0.9960 and ARE = 2.06%, while the kinetic model with the best fit was the Elovich model R2 = 0.9928 and ARE = 5.44%. The results showed that the maximum Cd(II) adsorption capacity of the biocomposite was equal to 16.34 mg/g at 25 °C and increased with increasing temperature up to 26.22 mg/g at 40 °C. The performed Cd desorption tests showed a significant efficiency of the biocomposite for five successive cycles of the sorption-desorption process with the use of HNO3, obtaining a leaching degree of 96–98.8%. The conducted research provides new data on the use of composites obtained from biomass, microorganisms and Fe3O4 in the bioremediation of heavy metals from water media and proves the effectiveness of removal and potential use in real environmental conditions of the biocomposite due to its easy recovery from contaminated aqueous solutions.
