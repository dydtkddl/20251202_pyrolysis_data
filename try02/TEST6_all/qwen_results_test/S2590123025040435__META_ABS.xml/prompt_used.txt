You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A low-temperature hydrothermal approach to fabricate bactericidal nanostructures on 3D-printed polylactic acid surfaces against Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria Surface modification offers the opportunity to create nano-topographies on various materials. Such modifications are widely applied to enhance solar energy absorption and electromagnetic shielding. An additional high-impact application involves nano-topographic surfaces designed to combat biofilm formation by nature inspired surfaces, such as cicada and dragonfly wings, which physically lyse bacterial cells. Such mechano-bactericidal surfaces have attracted growing interest over the past decade, and ongoing efforts translate these structures into medical and industrial applications. While considerable progress has been achieved with metallic and ceramic surfaces, advancements in polymers remain limited, despite their widespread use. In this study, a low-temperature hydrothermal approach successfully modified the 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA) surface to nano-topographies. Although the literature describes a limited number of strategies for producing nanostructures on 3D metallic surfaces, fabricating such structures on 3D polymeric surfaces remains challenging using conventional methods. This study demonstrates the successful fabrication of distinct nanostructures on both the top and bottom surfaces of a 3D-printed PLA substrate. The produced surfaces were characterised via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), SEM-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The bactericidal efficacy (BE) was quantified via LIVE/DEAD™ BacLight™ bacterial viability assay with inverted fluorescence microscopy images. Among the developed structures, Nano-Pockets with an average pore diameter of ∼275 nm exhibited the highest BE, achieving a 48.8 % reduction in Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa viability within 1 hour of incubation. This approach, therefore, lays the foundation for fabricating nanostructures on 3D-printed polymeric surfaces with complex geometries.
