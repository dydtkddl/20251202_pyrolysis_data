You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) production from catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics: The influence of catalyst and reaction pressure The production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by catalytic pyrolysis of plastics is an environmentally friendly and promising method of waste treatment and energy/materials production. Three types of metal catalysts (Fe/cordierite, Ni/cordierite and Ni-Mg/cordierite) were utilized during the catalytic pyrolysis process of polypropylene in this work. Meanwhile, the influence of reaction pressure (0.5–1.25 MPa) on the synthesis of CNTs was investigated. Carbon formation, especially CNTs, through catalytic pyrolysis of plastics has been tested in a fixed bed reactor, and the materials have been analyzed by temperature program oxidation (TPO), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The highest yield around 93 wt.% filamentous carbon was obtained using the Ni-based catalyst. The strong metal-support interaction within the Ni-Mg-based catalyst suppressed CNTs growth and resulted in shorter and irregular cylindrical carbon tubes. The yield of more uniform and thick CNTs increased with the additional of appropriate reaction pressure, especially at 1.0 MPa (198 mg/gPP). However, an excessive reaction pressure weakened CNTs growth and produced shorter length and larger diameters (around 30–50 nm) CNTs. The fraction of CNTs decreased when the reaction pressure was higher than 0.5 MPa.
