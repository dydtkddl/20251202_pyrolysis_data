Pyrolysis of Kraft lignin: yields and correlations A semibatch flow reactor connected in series between a Pyroprobe 1000 and a gas chromatographer was used to study the production of gases from Kraft lignin at different nominal temperatures (ranging from 500 to 900 °C) and different residence times of the volatiles in the hot zone. Using this experimental equipment, it is possible to differentiate between the primary reactions that take place in the Pyroprobe 1000 and the secondary reactions that take place in the secondary reactor. Yields of 13 pyrolysis products (methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene, propane, hydrocarbons with four carbon atoms, benzene, other aromatics, CO, CO2, methanol together with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and water) were analyzed as a function of experimental conditions. Correlations of the products analyzed with those of methane are discussed.
