You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-gasification of wastes plastics for syngas production using metal modified zeolite catalysts under different ratio of nitrogen/oxygen The aim of this study was the syngas production by the gasification of plastic waste (polyethylene, polypropylene and terephthalate polyethylene). Ca, Ce, La, Mg and Mn were used to promote the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst in order to enhance the production of higher syngas yield. The modified catalysts can enhanced the reaction rate of the pyrolysis process and resulting in high syngas in the product yields. Especially cerium, lanthanum promoted catalysts can enhance the yield of syngas. The effect of the reaction temperature and nitrogen/oxygen ratio of the carrier gas was also investigated. The maximum syngas production was obtained with lanthanum catalyst (112.2 mmol/g (95%N2 and 5%O2), and 130.7 mmol/g (90%N2 and 10%O2) at 850 °C. Less carbon depositions was found at 850 °C or even by the using of catalyst and more oxygen in the carrier gas. The oxygen content of the pyrolysis-gasification atmosphere had a key role to the syngas yield and affects significantly the carbon-monoxide/carbon-dioxide ratio. Catalysts can also accelerate the methanization reactions and isomerize the main carbon frame. Increasing in both temperature and oxygen in the atmosphere led to higher n-paraffin/n-olefin ratio and more multi-ring aromatic hydrocarbons in pyrolysis oils. The concentration of hydrocarbons containing oxygen and branched compounds was also significantly affected by catalysts.
