You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of catalyst and reaction conditions on aromatic monomer yields, product distribution, and sugar yields during lignin hydrogenolysis of silver birch wood The impact of catalyst choice and reaction conditions during catalytic hydrogenolysis of silver birch biomass are assessed for their effect on aromatic monomer yields and selectivities, lignin removal, and sugar yields from enzymatic hydrolysis. At a reaction temperature of 220 °C with no supplemental H2, it was demonstrated that both Co/C and Ni/C exhibited aromatic monomer yields of >50%, which were close to the theoretical maximum expected for the lignin based on total β-O-4 content and exhibited high selectivities for 4-propylguaiacol and 4-propylsyringol. Pd/C exhibited a significantly different set of products, and using a model lignin dimer, showed a product profile that shifted upon inclusion of supplemental H2, suggesting that the generation of surface hydrogen is critical for this catalyst system. Lignin removal during hydrogenolysis could be correlated to glucose yields and inclusion of lignin depolymerizing catalysts significantly improves lignin removal and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis yields.
