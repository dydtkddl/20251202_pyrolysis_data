Effect of catalyst and reaction conditions on aromatic monomer yields, product distribution, and sugar yields during lignin hydrogenolysis of silver birch wood The impact of catalyst choice and reaction conditions during catalytic hydrogenolysis of silver birch biomass are assessed for their effect on aromatic monomer yields and selectivities, lignin removal, and sugar yields from enzymatic hydrolysis. At a reaction temperature of 220 °C with no supplemental H2, it was demonstrated that both Co/C and Ni/C exhibited aromatic monomer yields of >50%, which were close to the theoretical maximum expected for the lignin based on total β-O-4 content and exhibited high selectivities for 4-propylguaiacol and 4-propylsyringol. Pd/C exhibited a significantly different set of products, and using a model lignin dimer, showed a product profile that shifted upon inclusion of supplemental H2, suggesting that the generation of surface hydrogen is critical for this catalyst system. Lignin removal during hydrogenolysis could be correlated to glucose yields and inclusion of lignin depolymerizing catalysts significantly improves lignin removal and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis yields.
