Direct Ink Writing of cobalt-zirconia monoliths for catalytic applications: A novel single-step fabrication approach Additive manufacturing technologies are revolutionizing the fabrication of ceramic catalysts through hierarchical design to enhance catalytic performance and simultaneously improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process by decreasing the initial investment and production steps. This work proposes a fabrication process of cobalt-zirconia monoliths based on Direct-Ink Writing of Co-enriched hydrogel-based ceramic inks, and the debinding and sintering at 600ºC in a single thermal treatment. The effect of Co precursor amount (3.0 −7.0 wt% Co) on the rheological properties of inks and the catalytic performance in ethanol steam reforming is investigated. The results reveal the successful incorporation of Co into rectilinear monoliths with 50 % infill, obtaining strongly Co-rich surfaces. The remarkable catalytic performance of the 5.0 wt% Co monolith at 300–600ºC confirms the feasibility of this novel single-step approach, reaching an appropriate balance between catalytic activity and printability. This outcome may represent a push towards the fabrication of fully 3D-printed monolithic catalysts.
