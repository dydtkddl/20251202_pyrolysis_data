You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Direct Ink Writing of cobalt-zirconia monoliths for catalytic applications: A novel single-step fabrication approach Additive manufacturing technologies are revolutionizing the fabrication of ceramic catalysts through hierarchical design to enhance catalytic performance and simultaneously improving the efficiency of the manufacturing process by decreasing the initial investment and production steps. This work proposes a fabrication process of cobalt-zirconia monoliths based on Direct-Ink Writing of Co-enriched hydrogel-based ceramic inks, and the debinding and sintering at 600ºC in a single thermal treatment. The effect of Co precursor amount (3.0 −7.0 wt% Co) on the rheological properties of inks and the catalytic performance in ethanol steam reforming is investigated. The results reveal the successful incorporation of Co into rectilinear monoliths with 50 % infill, obtaining strongly Co-rich surfaces. The remarkable catalytic performance of the 5.0 wt% Co monolith at 300–600ºC confirms the feasibility of this novel single-step approach, reaching an appropriate balance between catalytic activity and printability. This outcome may represent a push towards the fabrication of fully 3D-printed monolithic catalysts.
