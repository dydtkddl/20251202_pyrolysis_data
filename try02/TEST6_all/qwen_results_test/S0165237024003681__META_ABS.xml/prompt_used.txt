You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimized production of aromatic hydrocarbons via corn stover pyrolysis: Utilizing high-density polyethylene as a hydrogen donor and red mud as a catalyst Biomass pyrolysis offers a promising route for high-value bio-oil production, yet the process is limited by low deoxygenation efficiency. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) served as a hydrogen donor, and acid-washed red mud (ACRM) acted as a catalyst to enhance the pyrolysis of corn stover (CS) for producing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). The results showed that the addition of ACRM significantly reduced the activation energy for co-pyrolysis, enhanced the reaction rate, and strengthened the synergistic effects between CS and HDPE. Optimal conditions yielded a MAHs selectivity of 64.5 % at 650°C with a CS: HDPE ratio of 1:1. However, excessively high temperatures facilitated the cyclization and polymerization of MAHs into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, while a high HDPE ratio diminished the synergistic effects. Furthermore, recycling tests confirmed the effective reusability of ACRM, with MAHs yields remaining above 40 % after four cycles. This study highlights the potential for valorizing industrial and agricultural wastes.
