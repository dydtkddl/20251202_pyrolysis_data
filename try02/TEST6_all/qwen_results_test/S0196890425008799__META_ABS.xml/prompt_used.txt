You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on co-pyrolysis of waste rapeseed oil and low-density polyethylene: Kinetic study and microwave-assisted process optimization In this study, an innovative feeding method for mixing waste rapeseed oil (WRO) with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) powder applied in microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis was proposed. In this way, the problems of the poor quality of bio-oil from waste rapeseed oil pyrolysis and the challenges of LDPE’s poor flowability and clogging problem during conventional pyrolysis was addressed. The pyrolysis behavior of WRO, LDPE, and their mixtures at varying ratios (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 0:1) was systematically investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), revealing that 2:1 of WRO to LDPE reduced the activation energy by 13.60 % (from calculated 189.68 kJ/mol to 163.89 kJ/mol). Py-GC/MS experiments were conducted on the basis of this ratio. This ratio was proved to maximize the synergistic effect. Microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis experiments further explored the effects of key parameters: pyrolysis temperature (450–650 °C), catalytic temperature (350–550 °C), and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), including feedstock-to-catalyst ratios (1:0–1:1) and co-feeding speed (1–5 mL/min). The optimal conditions (pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, catalytic temperature of 400 °C, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio of 2:1) maximized the bio-oil quality between WRO and LDPE, yielding bio-oils with relative content of 60.4 % for mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and minimal relative content of 3.32 % for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Crucially, comparative experiments with separate feeding (SF) of WRO and LDPE underscored the superiority of the pre-mixed co-feeding (PC) strategy: PC achieved nearly 71 % higher bio-oil yield (60.33 % vs. 36.12 %) and elevated MAHs content (60.4 % vs. 53.63 %). This work provided a practical and efficient pathway for converting recalcitrant plastic and waste oil into high-value biofuels.
