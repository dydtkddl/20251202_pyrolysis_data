Study on co-pyrolysis of waste rapeseed oil and low-density polyethylene: Kinetic study and microwave-assisted process optimization In this study, an innovative feeding method for mixing waste rapeseed oil (WRO) with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) powder applied in microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis was proposed. In this way, the problems of the poor quality of bio-oil from waste rapeseed oil pyrolysis and the challenges of LDPE’s poor flowability and clogging problem during conventional pyrolysis was addressed. The pyrolysis behavior of WRO, LDPE, and their mixtures at varying ratios (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 0:1) was systematically investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), revealing that 2:1 of WRO to LDPE reduced the activation energy by 13.60 % (from calculated 189.68 kJ/mol to 163.89 kJ/mol). Py-GC/MS experiments were conducted on the basis of this ratio. This ratio was proved to maximize the synergistic effect. Microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis experiments further explored the effects of key parameters: pyrolysis temperature (450–650 °C), catalytic temperature (350–550 °C), and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), including feedstock-to-catalyst ratios (1:0–1:1) and co-feeding speed (1–5 mL/min). The optimal conditions (pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, catalytic temperature of 400 °C, feedstock-to-catalyst ratio of 2:1) maximized the bio-oil quality between WRO and LDPE, yielding bio-oils with relative content of 60.4 % for mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and minimal relative content of 3.32 % for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Crucially, comparative experiments with separate feeding (SF) of WRO and LDPE underscored the superiority of the pre-mixed co-feeding (PC) strategy: PC achieved nearly 71 % higher bio-oil yield (60.33 % vs. 36.12 %) and elevated MAHs content (60.4 % vs. 53.63 %). This work provided a practical and efficient pathway for converting recalcitrant plastic and waste oil into high-value biofuels.
