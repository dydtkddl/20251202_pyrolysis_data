Advances in high-pressure and high-temperature heat exchangers: Innovations via additive manufacturing and their applications This paper provides a comprehensive overview of technological developments and applications for high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) heat exchangers produced through additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. As the demand for high-efficiency energy systems has been rising, the role of heat exchangers for thermal management and transport is becoming increasingly crucial. In this context, AM has emerged as a promising manufacturing solution to address the challenges posed by higher operating temperatures and/or pressures. This paper delves into three primary areas: the exploration of HPHT regimes supported by conventional heat exchangers, the impact of AM processes on thermal transport devices, and the discussion focused on HPHT heat exchangers produced via AM. The study examines the traditional manufacturing processes, materials, structures and geometries, and limitations of the commonly used heat exchangers for HPHT applications. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of AM in optimizing HPHT heat exchanger design, by reviewing studies that enable uniform flow distribution, minimization of fouling, and thermo-hydraulic performance augmentation without compromising structural stability. While addressing the limitations of cost, size, and other constraints, this study offers insights into the possibilities of AM in revolutionizing HPHT heat exchanger technology. The goal has been to fill the gap in literature by summarizing key studies, findings, and limitations, presenting a detailed examination, and proposing new areas for research. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of AM’s role in advancing HPHT heat exchangers for future energy systems.
