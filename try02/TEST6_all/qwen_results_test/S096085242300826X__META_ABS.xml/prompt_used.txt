You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing performance of iron-rich sludge ash as cost-effective oxygen carrier by calcium-based additive for syngas production from biomass chemical-looping gasification Chemical-looping gasification tests were conducted on pine sawdust using thermogravimetric analyzer and horizontal sliding resistance furnace to investigate the regulation effects of calcium-based additive on iron-rich sludge ash oxygen carrier. The impacts of temperature, CaO/C in mole, multiple redox cycles, CaO addition modes on gasification performances were analyzed. The TGA results indicated that the CaO addition could effectively capture CO2 from syngas to from CaCO3, which subsequently decomposed at high temperatures. From in-situ CaO addition experiments, the temperature rise resulted in higher syngas yields, while a decrease in syngas LHV. With the CaO/C growing, the H2 yield grew from 0.103 to 0.256Nm3/kg at 800.0℃, and the CO yield boosted from 0.158 to 0.317Nm3/kg. Multiple redox manifested that the SA oxygen carrier and calcium-based additive kept higher reaction stability. The possible reaction mechanisms showed that the syngas variations from BCLG were influenced by the calcium roles and valence change of iron.
