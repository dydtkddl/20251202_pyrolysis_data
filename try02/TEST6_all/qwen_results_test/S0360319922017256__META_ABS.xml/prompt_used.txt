You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-linear kinetic analysis of catalytic hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane with nano-structured Pd/TiO2 catalyst In this study, the hydrogen generation from catalytic hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB) solution catalyzed by nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) supported Pd metallic catalyst was carried out. TiO2 support material was synthesized by the sol-gel method from titanium (IV) ethoxide. Pd was loaded into TiO2 by the conventional impregnation-reduction method and reduction was carried out at 750 °C in an H2 atmosphere. The characterization of catalysts was done with SEM-EDX and multi-point BET analysis. To investigate the hydrogen production by catalytic hydrolysis of EDAB, parameters such as Pd loading (2–4% by weight) and temperature (40–80 °C) were chosen in the presence of ethylenediamine bisborane aqueous solution (0.034% by weight). Detailed non-linear kinetic analysis was applied to the experimental data by considering and Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and power law. The activation energy Ea was calculated as Ea = 33.61 kJ mol−1 and Ea = 36.32 kJ mol−1 according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood and power-law model respectively for the Pd/TiO2 catalyst.
