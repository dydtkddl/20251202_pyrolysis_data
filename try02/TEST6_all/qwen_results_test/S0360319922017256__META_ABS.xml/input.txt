Non-linear kinetic analysis of catalytic hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane with nano-structured Pd/TiO2 catalyst In this study, the hydrogen generation from catalytic hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB) solution catalyzed by nanostructured titanium dioxide (TiO2) supported Pd metallic catalyst was carried out. TiO2 support material was synthesized by the sol-gel method from titanium (IV) ethoxide. Pd was loaded into TiO2 by the conventional impregnation-reduction method and reduction was carried out at 750 °C in an H2 atmosphere. The characterization of catalysts was done with SEM-EDX and multi-point BET analysis. To investigate the hydrogen production by catalytic hydrolysis of EDAB, parameters such as Pd loading (2–4% by weight) and temperature (40–80 °C) were chosen in the presence of ethylenediamine bisborane aqueous solution (0.034% by weight). Detailed non-linear kinetic analysis was applied to the experimental data by considering and Langmuir-Hinshelwood model and power law. The activation energy Ea was calculated as Ea = 33.61 kJ mol−1 and Ea = 36.32 kJ mol−1 according to Langmuir-Hinshelwood and power-law model respectively for the Pd/TiO2 catalyst.
