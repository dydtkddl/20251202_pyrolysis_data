You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of atomic substitution on the sodium manganese ferrite thermochemical cycle for hydrogen production This work presents the effect of atomic substitution on the MnFe2O4–Na2CO3 thermochemical cycle for H2 production. The non-oxidative decarbonation/carbonation reaction of the MnFe2O4–Na2CO3 mixture is investigated as the starting reference. Repeated cycling results in a 30% loss of reversibility due to an overall reduction of the reactive interfaces. The substitution of Na2CO3 for Li2CO3 decreases the decarbonation onset temperature by about 100 °C, but almost no reversibility is observed during the cycles due to the irreversible Li+ intercalation. The effect of partial Mn substitution for Ca, Ni, and Zn is presented. The 5% Zn mixture shows the best decarbonation/carbonation reversibility and is tested for H2 production together with MnFe2O4–Na2CO3. The reference mixture produces more H2 during the first cycle (≈1.1 vs. 0.7 mmol/g), but its production drastically drops by two orders of magnitude upon cycling and becomes negligible after 5 cycles. By contrast, the Zn-doped mixture exhibits a stable H2 production of 0.22 mmol/g with no decreasing trend observed from cycle 2 to cycle 5. As result, in the fifth cycle, the Zn-doped mixture produces 23 times more H2 than MnFe2O4–Na2CO3. Thermogravimetry and X-ray diffraction confirm that doping with Zn significantly improves the regeneration of the reactants.
