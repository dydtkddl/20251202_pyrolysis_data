You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-temperature steam gasification of wood using a two-stage gasification process to avoid bed agglomeration in a fluidized bed gasifier and tar problems Steam gasification of wood was conducted using a two-stage gasification process with fluidized bed and tar cracking reactors connected in series. This research explores the possibility of producing a H2-rich syngas while avoiding bed agglomeration and tar problems at the same time. In the current study, a low fluidized bed temperature was performed with activated carbon as a tar removal additive. Experiments at a fluidized bed temperature of about 600 °C successfully produced low-tar and H2-rich syngases without any operational problems. When activated carbon was applied, the tar concentration in syngas sharply decreased from 3120 to 48–215 mg/Nm3 (reduction rate: 93.1–98.5 %). Activated carbon also increased syngas and H2 yields. The maximum syngas and H2 yields were 1.7 Nm3/kgdry_wood and 68 g/kgdry_wood, respectively. Further, with activated carbon, the condensed tar yield drastically decreased from 26.9 to 2.9–9.5 g/kgdry_wood. A long-term wood gasification was performed for 3 h to test the stability of the two-stage gasification operation. The syngas development was stable at this reaction time, and the H2 yield was still high at 47.2 g/kgdry_feed. Additionally, toluene, which can be used a fuel source, was the sole tar component produced in the 3-h gasification.
