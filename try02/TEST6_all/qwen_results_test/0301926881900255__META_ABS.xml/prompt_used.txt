You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of Transvaal kerogens. II. An evaluation of vacuum pyrolysis with polyethylene, polystyrene and their mixtures with minerals A series of experiments have been conducted with polyethylene and polystyrene standards in an attempt to define the advantages and limitations of a vacuum pyrolysis—gas chromatography—mass spectrometry procedure for the characterization of kerogen and other macromolecular substances. Effects of variations in pyrolysis temperatures and times, sample sizes (weights) and thickness were evaluated together with the reproducibility of the nature and abundances of pyrolyzates. The effects of minerals (illite and quartz) admixed in the polymers were also considered with reference to the nature of the breakdown products. Optimal pyrolysis conditions, where primary pyrolyzates were sufficiently abundant and secondary products did not hinder characterization, were attained at 450°C and 60–90 min. The reproducibility of the nature and quantities of pyrolyzates was rather satisfactory at this temperature and pyrolysis time. However, relatively large samples of macromolecular matter, which is considerably volatile at this temperature, led to the synthesis of an abundant yield of secondary products, but sample thickness does not affect the nature of pyrolyzates. Admixed mineral matter affected the nature and relative abundances of the pyrolyzates but did not impede characterization of samples, as primary breakdown products were discernible. Macromolecular substances of limited volatility, heterogeneous chemical composition and containing intractable mineral matter, such as many kerogens, need to be pyrolyzed as relatively large samples. The vacuum procedure used in these studies may be to advantage, as compared with some other methods, to pyrolyze such samples. This method seems to be also suitable for the pyrolysis of volatile macromolecular matter, provided that small samples are employed.
