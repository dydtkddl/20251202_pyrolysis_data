The role of solid, liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon precursors on chemical vapor deposition grown carbon nanomaterials' growth temperature Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) has been hugely favored when producing high-quality carbon nanomaterials and repeatable output. Despite being hugely favored, CVD typically requires a high temperature of above 1000 °C, which becomes the downside of this method. It requires a high cost and complicated processing environment, which explains the urgent need for low-temperature processing. Molecule properties of hydrocarbon precursors are believed to have played an essential role in CVD synthesis as it can affect the growth temperature, yield, crystallinity properties and indirectly affect the morphology of the carbon nanomaterials. In this review, various solid, liquid, and gaseous hydrocarbon precursors and how they affect the growth temperature of carbon nanomaterials syntheses via CVD are discussed.
