You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted synthesis of N/S-doped CNC/SnO2 nanocomposite as a promising catalyst for oxygen reduction in alkaline media In this study, we report an all-green approach for the synthesis of novel catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a simple two-step procedure. In particular, conductive cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were obtained via pyrolysis, and a successive microwave-assisted hydrothermal process was employed to activate the carbon lattice by introducing sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) dopants, and to decorate the surface with tin oxide (SnO2) nanocrystals. The successful synthesis of N/S-doped CNC/SnO2 nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis, Energy Dispersive X-ray microanalysis, X-ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The synergistic effects of the dopants and SnO2 nanocrystals in modifying the catalytic performance were proved by various electrochemical characterizations. Particularly, the nanocomposite material reaches remarkable catalytic performance towards the ORR, close to the Pt/C benchmark, in alkaline environment, showing promising potential to be implemented in alkaline fuel cell and metal-air battery applications.
