You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Elucidating coke formation and evolution in the catalytic steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis volatiles at different fixed bed locations The evolution and the main mechanisms of catalyst deactivation have been assessed throughout continuous operation in the steam reforming of biomass pyrolysis volatiles. Biomass pyrolysis was conducted in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500 °C and the subsequent reforming step in a fixed bed reactor at 600 °C. The influence of catalyst location on the reforming reactor is also analyzed at different axial positions. Deactivated samples have been characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM and TEM images, TPO, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies. Coke deposition is the main cause of initial catalyst decay, with no sintering or oxidation of Ni sites being observed. As reaction proceeds, a deactivation front is observed along the reforming catalytic bed, with coke location within the catalyst, and its nature and composition depending on the volatile composition reaching each axial position in the bed. At the inlet section of the catalytic bed (A1), the coke is deposited on Ni sites and is of rather oxygenated nature. At further axial bed locations, the catalyst is in contact with a volatile stream whose composition has been considerably modified, which leads to the formation of a more structured coke with higher graphitization degree and made up of more condensed polyaromatic compounds. Moreover, the coke deposited on all deactivated samples does not present any specific morphology, which is evidence of its amorphous structure regardless the bed location and reaction time.
