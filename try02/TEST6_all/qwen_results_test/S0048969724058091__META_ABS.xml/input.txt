Impact of several sludge dewatering conditioners on municipal sludge pyrolysis properties, kinetics, by-products, and environmental risk assessment The pyrolysis characteristics of four different types of conditioned sludge were ascertained, and PAM, CaO, K2FeO4, and K2FeO4-CaO-PAM (KCP) conditioners were employed as sludge dewatering conditioners. The sludge pyrolysis reaction's activation energy (E) dropped with the addition of four conditioners. CaO, PAM, KCP, and K2FeO4 were the sequences of E needed for the pyrolysis of four different types of conditioned sludge. The addition of K2FeO4, CaO, and KCP resulted in an increase in the yields of H2 and CO. Except for the K2FeO4 conditioning sludge carbon, the pyrolytic carbon of the other three groups of samples showed an increase in S contents, while the pyrolytic carbon of the four groups of samples treated with conditioners clearly showed lower C and N contents compared to the raw sludge carbon. Protein-N made up the majority of N in sludge pyrolytic carbon. After adding conditioner, the level of organic sulfur decreased. Organic sulfur could then be broken down by K2FeO4 and CaO. The four conditioners efficiently mitigated the ecological and environmental risks posed by heavy metals. Alkynes were the most abundant result in pyrolytic volatiles of sludge pyrolysis; the other products included acids, alcohols, lipids, furans, ketones, phenols, hydrocarbons, N-components, and so on. All samples' acids, alcohols, and ketones from pyrolysis were decreased once the conditioner was added. The acid reduction rate reached 66.7 %, and the alkynes clearly increased during the KCP conditioned sludge's pyrolysis. The sulfur level of the bio-oil was decreased by all four conditioners. Everything mentioned above indicated that the KCP aided in the subsequent pyrolysis of the sludge, leading to the production of an advantageous pyrolysis bio-oil.
