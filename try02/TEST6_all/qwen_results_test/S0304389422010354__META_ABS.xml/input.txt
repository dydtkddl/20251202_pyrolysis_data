Buckwheat hull-derived biochar immobilized in alginate beads for the adsorptive removal of cobalt from aqueous solutions Buckwheat hull-derived biochar (BHBC) beads were synthesized by immobilizing biochar powder with alginate. Due to their cation-exchange ability, abundant functional groups, microporous structure, and large surface area, BHBC beads were successfully applied for the removal of cobalt from aqueous solution. The adsorption behavior followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm model showed a better fit to adsorption data than the Freundlich or Temkin isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity of BHBC beads was 24.0 mg/g at pH 5, 35 °C, and an initial cobalt concentration of 1.0 g/L, which was higher than those of previously reported natural resource-based adsorbents. In a fixed-bed column study, the effects of operating parameters such as flow rate, bed height, and bed diameter were investigated. Both the Thomas and Yoon–Nelson models were applied to the experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves using nonlinear regression. Overall, BHBC beads can be used as an efficient adsorbent for removal of radioactive cobalt from aqueous solution.
