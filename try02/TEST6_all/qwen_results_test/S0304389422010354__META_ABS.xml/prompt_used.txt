You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Buckwheat hull-derived biochar immobilized in alginate beads for the adsorptive removal of cobalt from aqueous solutions Buckwheat hull-derived biochar (BHBC) beads were synthesized by immobilizing biochar powder with alginate. Due to their cation-exchange ability, abundant functional groups, microporous structure, and large surface area, BHBC beads were successfully applied for the removal of cobalt from aqueous solution. The adsorption behavior followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm model showed a better fit to adsorption data than the Freundlich or Temkin isotherm models. The maximum adsorption capacity of BHBC beads was 24.0 mg/g at pH 5, 35 °C, and an initial cobalt concentration of 1.0 g/L, which was higher than those of previously reported natural resource-based adsorbents. In a fixed-bed column study, the effects of operating parameters such as flow rate, bed height, and bed diameter were investigated. Both the Thomas and Yoon–Nelson models were applied to the experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves using nonlinear regression. Overall, BHBC beads can be used as an efficient adsorbent for removal of radioactive cobalt from aqueous solution.
