You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of pyrolysis temperature on pistachio shell biochar for enhanced PFOA removal from wastewater: A sustainable approach to PFAS remediation Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent pollutant in water, posing significant health risks due to its bioaccumulation and toxicity. This study investigates the effective removal of PFOA using pistachio shell-derived biochar (PS-BC), with an emphasis on optimizing pyrolysis temperature. Among the tested materials, biochar produced at 900 °C (BC-900 °C), with a surface area of 687.87 m2/g, exhibited superior adsorption performance. At an initial PFOA concentration of 4 mg/L and pH 5, BC-900 °C achieved over 99 % removal efficiency at a dosage of 1 g/L within 2 h. The maximum Langmuir adsorption capacity was determined to be 41.07 mg/g. Kinetic studies showed the adsorption followed a pseudo-first-order model (R2 = 0.9825), indicating a physisorption mechanism. Adsorption isotherms were best described by the Liu model (R2 = 0.9398), suggesting a heterogeneous adsorbent surface with sites of varying affinities and finite adsorption capacity. Thermodynamics indicated that adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic. BC-900 °C also demonstrated strong regeneration potential, maintaining approximately 94 % efficiency over five adsorption-desorption cycles. Its performance remained stable across a broad ionic strength range, with removal efficiencies from 94.3 % to 92.9 % in NaCl concentrations between 0.001 M and 0.1 M, underscoring robustness under varying salinity. Co-existing ions had minimal effect on removal performance, confirming selectivity. Notably, BC-900 °C achieved high PFOA removal at both 1 and 10 mg/L concentrations in complex real wastewater from a nearby food industry, demonstrating practical applicability. These results highlight BC-900 °C as a sustainable, cost-effective, and high-performance adsorbent for PFOA remediation in water treatment systems.
