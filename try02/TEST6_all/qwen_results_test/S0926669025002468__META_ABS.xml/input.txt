Efficient and rapid depolymerization of Kraft lignin to bio-oil using microwave heating with solvent sequential extraction Energy-intensive conditions in conventional methods for lignin depolymerization highlight the need for more sustainable approaches. Microwave irradiation, known for its faster heating, lower energy consumption, and reduced reaction times, makes it an ideal alternative. This study explored the feasibility of microwave-assisted lignin depolymerization in isopropanol and formic acid without a metal-based catalyst. The temperature and lignin dosage emerged as the most critical factors influencing yield and molecular weight. The highest bio-oil yield of 55 % was achieved by depolymerizing 0.5 g of lignin at 120 °C for 30 min. Due to the complex oligomer mixture in the bio-oil, a sequential solvent extraction method was used to obtain uniform fractions. The process involved sequential dissolution in ethyl acetate, dichloromethane/toluene, and hexane, with the insoluble residues collected at each process step. The extraction process favored a reduction in molecular weight, achieved a narrower polydispersity, and increased the concentration of phenolic units. These changes made the oligomeric fractions more suitable for various applications, enhancing their potential as replacements for petroleum-based compounds. This study also examined the biochar derived from the insoluble fraction of depolymerization, emphasizing its role in improving lignin valorization. Preliminary analysis indicated that 34 wt% of biochar was produced, with the majority of silica and inorganic compounds retained in this fraction.
