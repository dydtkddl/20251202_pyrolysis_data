You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient and rapid depolymerization of Kraft lignin to bio-oil using microwave heating with solvent sequential extraction Energy-intensive conditions in conventional methods for lignin depolymerization highlight the need for more sustainable approaches. Microwave irradiation, known for its faster heating, lower energy consumption, and reduced reaction times, makes it an ideal alternative. This study explored the feasibility of microwave-assisted lignin depolymerization in isopropanol and formic acid without a metal-based catalyst. The temperature and lignin dosage emerged as the most critical factors influencing yield and molecular weight. The highest bio-oil yield of 55 % was achieved by depolymerizing 0.5 g of lignin at 120 °C for 30 min. Due to the complex oligomer mixture in the bio-oil, a sequential solvent extraction method was used to obtain uniform fractions. The process involved sequential dissolution in ethyl acetate, dichloromethane/toluene, and hexane, with the insoluble residues collected at each process step. The extraction process favored a reduction in molecular weight, achieved a narrower polydispersity, and increased the concentration of phenolic units. These changes made the oligomeric fractions more suitable for various applications, enhancing their potential as replacements for petroleum-based compounds. This study also examined the biochar derived from the insoluble fraction of depolymerization, emphasizing its role in improving lignin valorization. Preliminary analysis indicated that 34 wt% of biochar was produced, with the majority of silica and inorganic compounds retained in this fraction.
