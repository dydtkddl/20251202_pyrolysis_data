TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) decorated macroporous silica particles: Synthesis, characterization, and their application in protein adsorption Effective protein adsorption has attracted attention for broad application in the biomedical field. In this study, we introduce the synthesis of a TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) decorated macroporous SiO2 (TOCN@macroporous SiO2) particle and its protein adsorption performance. The TOCN@macroporous SiO2 particles have a unique cellulose nanofiber network structure on the macroporous, highly-negative zeta potential (−62 ± 2 mV) and high surface area (30.8 m2/g) for dried-state cellulose based particles. These characteristics provide sites that are rich in electrostatic interaction to exhibit an outstanding adsorption capacity of lysozyme (1865 mg/g). Furthermore, the TOCN@macroporous SiO2 particles have remarkably high reusability (>90% adsorption capacity) and good release of adsorbate (>80%) after 10 times of use. The material proposed in this paper has the potential for application in drug delivery, protein adsorption, biosensors, and other biomedical fields.
