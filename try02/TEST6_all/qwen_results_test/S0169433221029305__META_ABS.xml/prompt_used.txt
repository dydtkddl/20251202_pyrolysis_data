You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on performance and charging dynamics of N/O codoped layered porous carbons derived from L-tyrosine for supercapacitors The development of electrode materials suitable for aqueous electrolyte and gel electrolyte can greatly promote green energy storage/conversion and contribute to carbon neutrality. Here, N/O codoped layered porous carbons (NOLPCs) are prepared from L-tyrosine by a simple method, and nanoscale NOLPC configuration is constructed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The NOLPCs with layered microstructure can fully contact electrolytes, and show large specific surface area (the highest up to 3221.57m2 g−1). NOLPC-4.5 for the asymmetric supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte displays high specific capacitance (512.21Fg−1 at 0.3Ag−1 and 336.43Fg−1 at 100Ag−1) and excellent cyclic stability (95.40% retention after 5000 cycles). Moreover, it for the asymmetric supercapacitor with gel electrolyte also shows high specific capacitance (285.41Fg−1 at 0.3Ag−1 and 192.24Fg−1 at 50Ag−1) and excellent cyclic stability (94.26% retention after 5000 cycles). The NOLPC configuration has similar microporous structure and elemental composition to the NOLPCs, and the electrolyte can adequately diffuse into its microporous structure. The NOLPCs, with simple preparation method and excellent energy storage performance, have a good development prospect in green energy storage/conversion. Using MD simulations to construct NOLPC configuration to investigate charging dynamics provides a novel idea for the application of MD simulation in supercapacitors.
