Experimental study on the combustion behavior and NOx emission during the co-combustion of combustible industrial solid wastes The combustible industrial solid wastes (CISW) include waste of textiles, paper, woody products, sludge and so on, generated from light industrial production. Excessive CISW can cause serious environmental pollution if not treated effectively. Incineration has become an efficient method for the disposal of CISWs due to its merits in rapid reduction and energy recovery. However, the incineration plants have often suffered from unstable combustion and serious air pollutant emissions due to the mismatch in the properties between the practical CISW blend and the designed target fuel. To achieve compatible CISW blends for the plant, the fundamental understanding of the combustion behavior and pollutant emission characteristics of individual CISWs and their designated blends during combustion is highly necessary. In this work, the combustion behavior of five CISWs has been studied on a thermogravimetric analyzer and the corresponding comprehensive combustion indexes (CCI) have been analyzed. Meanwhile, NOx emission during the combustion of individual or blended CISWs has been studied. It has been revealed that adding fungi or waste tires to paper mill sludge can effectively increase the CCI of blended fuels and reduce NOx emission. A linear correlation has been established between the conversion ratio of fuel-N to NOx and fuel components. The synergetic effect generated from the proper blending among different CISWs has been observed and quantitatively analyzed. Such an effect played a significant role in inhibiting NOx generation during the co-combustion of different CISWs caused by the reduction of porous char with high activity and several inorganic minerals. This study provides a theoretical basis for seeking a way of the suitable fuel blends.
