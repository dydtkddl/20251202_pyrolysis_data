A review for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) utilization in capture and conversion of carbon dioxide into valuable products Carbon dioxide (CO2) has become a primary atmospheric greenhouse gas that has stirred up numerous energies and environmental-related mishaps around the world. Its unwelcome contribution to the decay of the global ecosystem has generated alarming concerns. Therefore, it has triggered an urgent need to design reliable methods for capturing and converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable chemical products and/or feedstocks. It is expected that these valuable chemical products will enhance significantly, the stability of the ecosystem and promote sustainable development of the energy sector. A few years back, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have displayed magnificent heterogeneous catalytic behavior owing to their appealing chemical features and high internal surface area. Because of the captivating properties possessed by these MOFs and their ease of synthesis, experimental tests to ascertain structure-function relationships for CO2 conversion into some value-added chemical products became lucrative. Therefore, in this review, recent developments, and the participation of MOFs as reliable catalysts for capturing and converting CO2 into valuable chemical products are critically reviewed. Finally, limitations and prospects of MOFs as heterogeneous catalysts for the capture and conversion of CO2, are addressed as well.
