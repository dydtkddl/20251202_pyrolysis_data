You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced oxygen activation in antibiotic degradation using N-doped carbon skeleton encapsulated high-entropy alloy catalysts The catalyst employed for activating molecular oxygen to degrade organic pollutants in water environments encounters great challenges, such as facile agglomeration, leaching of metal ions, and a sluggish redox cycle. These factors lead to low catalytic activity and inadequate stability, thereby severely restricting its viability for industrial use. A high-entropy alloy (HEA) catalyst, FeCoNiCuZn@CN, was synthesized via a hydrothermal-pyrolysis method and employed to facilitate the degradation of norfloxacin (NOR) by activating molecular oxygen. The FeCoNiCuZn@CN is a face-centered cubic (FCC) structured FeCoNiCuZn HEA embedded within a nitrogen-doped carbon framework, as proved by XRD, Raman, SEM, XPS, and TEM. The optimized FeCoNiCuZn@CN6–800 demonstrates efficient degradation of NOR, achieving a removal rate exceeding 95 % within 40 min across a broad pH range of 3–11. The catalyst exhibits a maximum mineralization rate of 72.4 %, surpassing recently reported catalysts. Moreover, it exhibits universal degradation properties toward diverse antibiotics and demonstrates strong interference-resistance against prevalent inorganic ions, making it well-suited for treating intricate water matrices. Even after five cycles, the removal efficiency remains at 78.4 %, thanks to the exceptional stability of the HEA and the encapsulation of the carbon skeleton. The intrinsic nature of the synergistic effect caused by the formed HEA and carbon-metal (C-M) bonds between HEA and CN was revealed, which was responsible for the prominent molecular oxygen activation capacity. The reaction mechanism was proposed through reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging experiment, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), molecular probing experiment, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, three degradation pathways were proposed by analyzing degradation intermediates, and the toxicity of intermediate products was predicted by T.E.S.T toxicity estimation software. This study opens new perspectives for the design and preparation of high-entropy-based catalysts that have an excellent ability to activate molecular oxygen in the field of wastewater treatment.
