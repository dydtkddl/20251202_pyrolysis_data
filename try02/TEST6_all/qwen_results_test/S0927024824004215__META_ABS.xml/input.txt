Advancements in end-of-life crystalline silicon photovoltaic module recycling: Current state and future prospects With the rapid development of the photovoltaic industry, it has brought abundant renewable energy to society, but at the same time, it is also accompanied by a series of negative problems. In order to effectively address these issues and reduce the impact of end-of-life photovoltaic modules on ecological environment quality and industry sustainable development, many researchers are dedicated to studying rational recycling and utilization of photovoltaic modules. This study reviews and evaluates the recycling technologies for crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules (c-Si PV modules) proposed in recent years. Based on this, the following five suggestions and prospects are proposed: optimizing recycling strategies; promoting interdisciplinary integration; improving relevant policies and regulations; establishing a complete recycling industry chain; and providing appropriate economic subsidies. It is pointed out that efficient recycling schemes with universal applicability designed for broken c-Si PV modules are more worthy of support, and component sorting and the carbon emissions of recycling processes need to be taken into account. Properly recycle low-value materials and carry out high-value utilization of photovoltaic materials. Emphasize the producer responsibility system and establish admission thresholds and qualification requirements for photovoltaic recycling enterprises. The aim of this study is to provide valuable references for the sustainable development of the photovoltaic recycling field.
