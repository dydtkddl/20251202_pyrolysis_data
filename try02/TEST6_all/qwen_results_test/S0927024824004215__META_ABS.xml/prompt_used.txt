You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in end-of-life crystalline silicon photovoltaic module recycling: Current state and future prospects With the rapid development of the photovoltaic industry, it has brought abundant renewable energy to society, but at the same time, it is also accompanied by a series of negative problems. In order to effectively address these issues and reduce the impact of end-of-life photovoltaic modules on ecological environment quality and industry sustainable development, many researchers are dedicated to studying rational recycling and utilization of photovoltaic modules. This study reviews and evaluates the recycling technologies for crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules (c-Si PV modules) proposed in recent years. Based on this, the following five suggestions and prospects are proposed: optimizing recycling strategies; promoting interdisciplinary integration; improving relevant policies and regulations; establishing a complete recycling industry chain; and providing appropriate economic subsidies. It is pointed out that efficient recycling schemes with universal applicability designed for broken c-Si PV modules are more worthy of support, and component sorting and the carbon emissions of recycling processes need to be taken into account. Properly recycle low-value materials and carry out high-value utilization of photovoltaic materials. Emphasize the producer responsibility system and establish admission thresholds and qualification requirements for photovoltaic recycling enterprises. The aim of this study is to provide valuable references for the sustainable development of the photovoltaic recycling field.
