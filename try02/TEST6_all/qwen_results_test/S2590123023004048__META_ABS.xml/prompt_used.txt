You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Challenges for recycling medium-density fiberboard (MDF) Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is commonly used for furniture manufactured. The increase in demand and the short relative lifecycle have increased the generated waste volume, increasing concerns about disposal. Despite being mainly composed of input from a renewable source, very little of this material is recycled. In this sense, this aim article performed a literature overview of MDF recycling technologies presenting the challenges and perspectives to overcome this problem. The relevant articles considered for this review were selected from the Web of Science and the Scopus databases. The first step for MDF recycling is its disintegration, which inevitably changes the properties of the wood fibers from MDF waste. Allied with this, the other constituents, like resin, are a challenge to a recycling process that, a priori, is more appropriately carried out only with fibers. Ideally, it would be recycling the MDF in new panels, however, due to the mentioned issues, it is not possible in its entirety, and in a continuous way (in several recycling cycles). As MDF waste is a material with caloric capacity during combustion, converting it to energy is a possibility, especially when other more sustainable alternatives are difficult. An emerging alternative is the pyrolysis and enzymolysis of MDF to obtain valued products. Further studies are needed, both for the disintegration processes to preserve the characteristics of the MDF fibers and the other constituents together with the MDF to favor its recycling. It is lacking evaluation of the economic, and principally environmental issues of each recycling alternative.
