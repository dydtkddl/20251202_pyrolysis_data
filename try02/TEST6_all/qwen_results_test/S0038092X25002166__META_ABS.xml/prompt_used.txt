You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the separation of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules using the green solvent NMP Solar energy, with its advantages of safety, reliability, cleanliness, and wide distribution, has seen a significant increase in photovoltaic (PV) installations. However, this growth has led to a large number of end of life PV modules. The adhesive effect of EVA (ethylene–vinyl acetate) makes it difficult to effectively separate and recycle the various layers of these modules. Therefore, the key to recycling silicon PV modules lies in removing or weakening the adhesive properties of EVA while protecting core components such as silicon from damage, thereby achieving efficient separation and recycling of the layers. This paper proposes a novel green treatment method using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent for recycling discarded PV modules. Through experimental studies, we investigated the effects of different NMP treatment conditions-including temperature, time, sheet size, and rotor speed-on the reaction rate of EVA. The optimal processing condition was found to be heating at 150 °C for 45 min. Kinetic fittings were performed under various conditions, and parameters were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and contact angle measurements. The mechanism of the reaction between NMP and EVA was analyzed. Finally, experiments were conducted on Commercial PV modules to develop a fundamentally harmless recycling process. A life cycle assessment of this recycling process was also carried out, providing theoretical guidance for future applications of NMP in the treatment of waste silicon PV modules.
