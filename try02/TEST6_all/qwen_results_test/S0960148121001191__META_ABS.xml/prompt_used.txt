You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enrichment of phenolic products in walnut shell pyrolysis bio-oil by combining torrefaction pretreatment with fractional condensation Walnut shell pyrolysis liquefaction experiments for phenolic enrichment were conducted using torrefaction pretreatment and fractional condensation simultaneously. Bio-oil composition was comprehensively analyzed for elements, functional groups and componential contents. After high-temperature torrefaction, the proportion of lignin pyrolytic products in pyrolysis organic vapors showed significant increment. Fractional condensation further separated water, acetic acid and other small molecular compounds, and improved the phenolic content in the target bio-oil. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis liquefaction technology, when 363 K water bath was utilized to recover 300 °C torrefied walnut shell pyrolysis vapors, the C/O ratio in bio-oil increased from 0.5 to 1.6, and the proportions of H in aromatic ring and phenolic OH increased by 150% and 400%, respectively. The total content of detectable phenols was enriched from 2.7 wt% to 13.3 wt%. The optimized scheme on improving economic efficiency was provided for offsetting torrefaction energy consumption and low bio-oil yield.
