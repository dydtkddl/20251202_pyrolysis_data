Catalytic conversion of cellulose to levoglucosenone using propylsulfonic acid functionalized SBA-15 and H2SO4 in tetrahydrofuran The catalytic conversion of cellulose to levoglucosenone (LGO) was studied using dilute sulfuric acid and propylsulfonic acid functionalized SBA-15 (PS-SBA-15) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). We show that the addition of small amounts of a liquid acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid complements the use of a solid acid catalyst for the conversion of cellulose. Sulfuric acid promotes the depolymerization of cellulose into levoglucosan (LGA). The main role of the solid Brønsted acid catalyst is to dehydrate the LGA into LGO. The addition of low concentrations of H2SO4 to PS-SBA-15 resulted in an increase in LGO yield of up to 37% (from 18% obtained using an equivalent amount of H2SO4 only). Our approach provides a novel alternative for a more environmentally friendly production of LGO.
