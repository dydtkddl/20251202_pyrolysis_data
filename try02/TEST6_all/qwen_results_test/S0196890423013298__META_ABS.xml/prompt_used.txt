You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic understanding of metal–acid synergetic hydroconversion of polyethylene under mild conditions over a Ru/MOR catalyst Hydroconversion has been demonstrated as a viable method to efficiently deconstruct polyolefins under relatively mild conditions. The hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds over Ru-based catalysts can convert polyolefins into liquid alkanes and methane. To suppress methane generation and obtain high-value isomer, further exploration of the mechanism for the cooperative deconstruction of polyolefins by bifunctional catalysts with metal–acid sites is necessary. In this study, we utilized ball milling to enhance the accessibility of acid sites within MOR zeolite, while the fragmented pore structure ensured that the loaded Ru metal was sufficiently accessible for long-chain alkanes. The sequential accessibility of metal–acid sites boosted the hydroconversion efficiency of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Through systematic investigations involving catalysts with various Ru loadings and Si/Al ratio of zeolites, it is discovered that the smaller-sized Ru particles not only facilitate the generation and desorption of olefinic intermediates in hydrocracking but also promote the hydrogenation and desorption of alkyls and suppress the cascade of terminal C–C bond cleavage in hydrogenolysis. Liquid fuel (C5-C21) yield was increased by 27% for the catalyst loaded with 0.7 wt% Ru on mMOR20 compared to 1.7 wt% loadings, while methane yield was only one-third of the latter. Concurrently, the distribution of acid sites on the zeolite surface affected the aggregation process of Ru atoms. This study deeply unveils the synergistic interaction of metal–acid sites, facilitating internal C–C bond cleavage to obtain liquid fuel and sheds light on catalyst design for waste polyolefins upcycling.
