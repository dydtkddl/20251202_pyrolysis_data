Continuous flow hydrothermal synthesis of MoVNbTeOx in micro-coil tubular reactor for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane MoVNbTeOx is the most promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) process, which is usually prepared by hydrothermal methods. However, the synthesis of MoVNbTeOx is time-consuming and sensitive to the homogeneity of the synthesis environment, which limits its preparation reproducibility and large-scale accessibility. In this work, a continuous flow hydrothermal synthesis (CFHTS) process for the preparation of MoVNbTeOx catalysts was developed and the synthesis parameters were screened using a tubular reactor. Using a micro coil tube as a reactor, MoVNbTeOx catalysts can be synthesized rapidly at 300 °C and 10 MPa. Meanwhile, the catalytic performance of MoVNbTeOx synthesized by CFHTS method was also significantly improved, with the activity nearly doubled compared to the samples prepared by the conventional method. Compared with the conventional method, the preparation time of CFHTS method can be shortened from 48 h in the batch mode to 10 min in the continuous mode, and the capacity per unit volume of the reactor has been increased by orders of magnitude, which provides the possibility of industrial scale-up of MoVNbTeOx catalysts.
