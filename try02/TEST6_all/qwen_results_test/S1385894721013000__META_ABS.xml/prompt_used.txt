You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic upcycling paper sludge for the recovery of minerals and production of renewable high-grade biofuels and bio-based chemicals Paper sludge is a solid waste by-product abundantly produced in the paper industry and contains fine minerals and lignocellulosic biomass. In this contribution, the ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of paper sludge with a high mineral content of ca. 71 wt% is reported for the first time and demonstrated in a pilot-scale unit (feeding rate of 11.3 kg h−1) using a granular Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (loading of 650 g) to produce a high-grade bio-oil at a fast pyrolysis temperature of 475 ± 5 °C (pre-screened using a pyroprobe) and a catalytic upgrading temperature of 500 °C. Besides, > 99 wt% minerals in the paper sludge could be recovered, including paper fillers such as CaCO3 (major) and talc. The bio-oil obtained at a carbon yield of 21 C.% has a low oxygen content of 3.2 wt%, a low total acidity number of 5.2 mg KOH g−1, low H2O content of 0.7 wt%, and a high higher heating value of 40.9 MJ kg−1. It consists of value-added bio-based chemicals such as paraffins, olefins, and low molecular weight aromatics. The results demonstrate that the use of paper sludge to recover minerals and to obtain fuels and chemicals using ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis is technically feasible at a pilot plant scale, which will be of importance for the development of future bio-based economy.
