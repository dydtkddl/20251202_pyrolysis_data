You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient production of biodiesel with electric furnace dust impregnated in Na2CO3 solution Solid catalyst (Na2CO3@EFD) was prepared by wet impregnation of electric furnace dust (EFD) in aqueous Na2CO3 solution. It had high basicity and acidity of 0.34 and 0.16 mmol/g for biodiesel production. High biodiesel yield of 99.8 wt% from soybean oil was obtained under the optimized reaction conditions (by Central Composite Design) of 71 °C in 111.36 min with 5.4 wt% catalyst and methanol/oil molar ratio of 11.8/1. After 11 cycles, biodiesel yield still maintained at 90.8 wt% with catalyst recovery rate >90 wt% by magnetic separation of catalyst EFD powders (containing Fe3O4 with magnetism of 59.1 Am2/kg). Pure Na2CO3 particles presented poorer recyclability with lower biodiesel yield of 89.5 wt% even at the eighth cycle by centrifugal separation. Na2CO3@EFD catalyst had high activity and recyclability because: (i) EFD as support hosted nanoparticles of Na2CO3 (30.3 nm) as main base site for transesterification; (ii) porous EFD support provided acidic sites from metal oxides (e.g., ZnO and Al2O3) for esterification; (iii) EFD adsorbed active components into its micropores to maintain high recyclability; and (iv) EFD magnetism from magnetic Fe3O4 kept high efficient magnetic separation. Total metals in the blended biodiesel met the National Standard of China and heavy metals were lower than typical petrochemical diesel. The study gave a practical use of industrial solid waste for the green production of biodiesel.
