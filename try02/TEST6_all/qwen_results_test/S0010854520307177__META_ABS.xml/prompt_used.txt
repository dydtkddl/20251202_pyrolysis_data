You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-organic framework-derived nanomaterials in environment related fields: Fundamentals, properties and applications Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new class of crystalline porous materials, composing of metal nodes and organic linkers, have been extensively used as versatile precursors or sacrificial templates for the preparation of numerous nanomaterials. The advantages of these MOF-derived nanomaterials such as controllable composition, tunable structure and high porosity endow them with enormous potential in many areas, including catalysis, sensors, energy storage and conversion. Herein, MOF derivatives in environment related fields are highly emphasized. The fundamental properties and general background of these nanomaterials are summarized. The primary strategies involved in compositional manipulation, pre-synthetic modulation, morphology control and post-synthetic treatment to improve the performance of MOF-derived nanomaterials are highlighted. In addition, we systematically discuss their recent progress in environmental cleaning and monitoring, especially for the wastewater treatment, air purification and target-specific sensing. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MOF-derived nanomaterials are also proposed. This article gives a comprehensive overview of MOF-derived nanomaterials for environmental applications and is expected to shed light on the further study in this highly exciting area.
