You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structure, magnetic and catalytic properties of SiO2-MFe2O4 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) nanocomposites and their syntheses by a modified sol–gel method The structure, magnetic and catalytic properties of silica - ferrite nanocomposites were investigated. A series of SiO2-MFe2O4 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) composites were synthesized by a sol–gel technique using citric acid and glycerin. The samples were characterized by TGA, XRD, TEM and BET methods. Results of magnetization measurements proved a strong dependence of the saturation magnetization and the blocking temperature on the calcination temperature. The Co-based nanocomposites showed increased coercive field of the magnetic hysteresis loops relative to the other studied nanocomposites. It was also observed that the structural differences of the Cu-based composites subjected to calcination at two temperatures significantly modify the magnetic behavior. The catalytic properties of composites were tested in nitrous oxide decomposition. The conversion of nitrous oxide over the SiO2-MFe2O4 composites increased in the sequence: Mn (39%) < Ni (69%) < Co (76%) = Cu (76%), at temperature 973 K and WHSV = 30000 ml·g −1 · h −1 .
