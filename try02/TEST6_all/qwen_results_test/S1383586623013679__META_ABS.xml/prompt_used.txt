You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Continuous flow synthesis of Ag-PEDOT-COF nanocomposite for sustainable photoreforming of plastic waste and chromium remediation in visible light Using the freely available solar energy for photocatalytic environmental remediation is a highly sustainable approach. Visible light active heterogeneous photocatalysts are to be developed for driving such reactions. Heterojunction nanocomposites of conjugated polymers with metals as well as other semiconductors are highly active photocatalysts. However, the synthesis of these materials involves multi-step reactions and harsh reaction conditions. Here, we report a single-step continuous flow synthesis of a nanocomposite (Ag@PEDOT-DAAQ-TFPFlow), containing a conducting polymer (PEDOT), silver (Ag) nanoparticles and a covalent organic framework (COF, DAAQ-TFP). The nanocomposite could be synthesised at a lower temperature and in less time when compared to a two-step batch process. Moreover, Ag@PEDOT-DAAQ-TFPFlow exhibited higher surface area and porosity than Ag@PEDOT-DAAQ-TFPBatch. Further, the former has improved ability to absorb light in a broad range, efficiently generate charge carriers and transfer them than the latter as well as Ag@PEDOT and, DAAQ-TFP. Thus, Ag@PEDOT-DAAQ-TFPFlow could be used as an efficient photocatalyst for photoreforming plastic waste to green hydrogen (113.4 mmol g cat - 1 h - 1 ) and other value-added products such as formate, acetate, terephthalate, and lactate. It is also one of the best visible light active photocatalysts for the reduction of toxic Cr (VI) to Cr (III). Thus, the enhanced mixing profile and better heat/mass transfer in the continuous flow synthesis process enabled us to achieve a highly active photocatalyst.
