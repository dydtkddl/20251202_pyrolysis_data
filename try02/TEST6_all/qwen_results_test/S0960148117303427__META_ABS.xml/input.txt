A comprehensive review on the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass In the pursuit of renewable sources of energy, biomass is emerging as a promising resource because of its abundance and carbon neutral nature. Pyrolysis is a prevailing technology for biomass conversion into the valuable hydrocarbon and alternative fuels. In this review, pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass has been addressed, focusing primarily on the ideal feedstock, technologies, reactors, and properties of the end product. Technical problems in using biofuel from pyrolysis, as transport fuel have also been discussed, along with solutions to address these challenges, and comments on the future scope of the pyrolysis process.
