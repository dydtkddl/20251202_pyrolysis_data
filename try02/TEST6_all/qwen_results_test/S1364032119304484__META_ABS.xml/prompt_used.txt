You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Promoted ZSM-5 catalysts for the production of bio-aromatics, a review This review covers the research and industrial activities on mainly Ga- and Zn-promoted ZSM-5 catalysts for the production of bio-aromatics in the thermochemical conversion of biomass and waste. The promoted ZSM-5 catalysts currently favoured in biomass aromatization have not initially been designed for biomass processing, but for the conversion of petrochemical feeds. In biomass pyrolysis, however, aromatization catalysts have to perform additional tasks to aromatization, such as cracking, reforming, decarboxylation, decarbonylation and the water-gas shift reaction. In addition, catalysts in biomass processing may have to operate with feeds containing acids, sulphur, nitrogen and minerals. Nevertheless, there is great similarity between the optimum catalysts for both petrochemical and biomass aromatization. The preferred aromatization catalysts for both gasification and pyrolysis are Ga- and Zn-promoted ZSM-5 catalysts that synergistically combine a dehydrogenation and an acidic function. Reduced extra-framework Ga cations residing at ZSM-5 exchange positions in close proximity to Brønsted acid sites are the likely active sites for aromatization. For Ga a reduction/oxidation activation procedure to form these sites is beneficial. For Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts ZnOH+ species appear to be the active sites. For these catalysts no reduction/oxidation activation is required. The key process parameters for aromatization are a temperature of 400–550 °C and a low space velocity of 0.5–1.0 h−1. In agreement with the bifunctional nature of Ga/ZSM-5 there exists an optimal Ga loading for each SAR. Best results were obtained with a molar ratio Ga/H+ or Zn/H+ close to 1.0. These catalysts also show the best stability.
