Formation and reduction of nitrogen oxides in fluidized-bed combustion The subject is critically reviewed. The following topics are covered: devolatilization of nitrogen compounds from solid fuel; homogeneous gas-phase reactions; oxidation of char-nitrogen; gas-solid reactions; heterogeneous catalytic reactions; and ways in which knowledge of the chemistry and kinetics can be applied to combustor modelling and operation.
