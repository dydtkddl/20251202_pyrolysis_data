Biochemical methane potential and active microbial communities during anaerobic digestion of biodegradable plastics at different inoculum-substrate ratios The influence of the inoculum-substrate ratio (ISR) on the mesophilic and thermophilic biochemical methane potential test of two biodegradable plastics was evaluated. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) were selected for this study, the first for being recalcitrant to mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) and the second, by contrast, for being readily biodegradable. Several ISRs, calculated on the basis of volatile solids (VS), were tested: 1, 2, 2.85, 4, and 10 g(VS of inoculum).g(VS of substrate)−1. A high ISR was associated with an enhanced methane production rate (i.e., biodegradation kinetics). However, the ultimate methane production did not change, except when inhibition was observed. Indeed, applying the lowest ISR to readily biodegradable plastics such as PHB resulted in inhibition of methane production. Based on these experiments, in order to have reproducible degradation kinetics and optimal methane production, an ISR between 2.85 and 4 is recommended for biodegradable plastics. The active microbial communities were analyzed, and the active bacteria differed depending on the plastic digested (PLA versus PHB) and the temperature of the process (mesophilic versus thermophilic). Previously identified PHB degraders (Ilyobacter delafieldii and Enterobacter) were detected in PHB-fed reactors. Thermogutta and Tepidanaerobacter were detected during the thermophilic AD of PLA, and they are probably involved in PLA hydrolysis and lactate conversion, respectively.
