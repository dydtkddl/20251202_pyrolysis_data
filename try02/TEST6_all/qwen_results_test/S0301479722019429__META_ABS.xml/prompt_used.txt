You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochemical methane potential and active microbial communities during anaerobic digestion of biodegradable plastics at different inoculum-substrate ratios The influence of the inoculum-substrate ratio (ISR) on the mesophilic and thermophilic biochemical methane potential test of two biodegradable plastics was evaluated. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) were selected for this study, the first for being recalcitrant to mesophilic anaerobic digestion (AD) and the second, by contrast, for being readily biodegradable. Several ISRs, calculated on the basis of volatile solids (VS), were tested: 1, 2, 2.85, 4, and 10 g(VS of inoculum).g(VS of substrate)−1. A high ISR was associated with an enhanced methane production rate (i.e., biodegradation kinetics). However, the ultimate methane production did not change, except when inhibition was observed. Indeed, applying the lowest ISR to readily biodegradable plastics such as PHB resulted in inhibition of methane production. Based on these experiments, in order to have reproducible degradation kinetics and optimal methane production, an ISR between 2.85 and 4 is recommended for biodegradable plastics. The active microbial communities were analyzed, and the active bacteria differed depending on the plastic digested (PLA versus PHB) and the temperature of the process (mesophilic versus thermophilic). Previously identified PHB degraders (Ilyobacter delafieldii and Enterobacter) were detected in PHB-fed reactors. Thermogutta and Tepidanaerobacter were detected during the thermophilic AD of PLA, and they are probably involved in PLA hydrolysis and lactate conversion, respectively.
