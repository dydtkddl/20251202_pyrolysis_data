You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-feeding effect of waste plastic films on the catalytic pyrolysis of Quercus variabilis over microporous HZSM-5 and HY catalysts The co-pyrolysis of Quercus variabilis (Q. variabilis) and waste plastic films (PFs) was investigated to evaluate the co-feeding effect of waste PFs to the pyrolysis of Q. variabilis. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that the second TG (DTG) peak temperature of waste PFs was decreased from 479 °C to 470 °C by applying its co-pyrolysis with Q. variabilis, suggesting the effective interaction between the pyrolysis intermediates of Q. variabilis and waste PFs. Pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis results showed that the typical pyrolyzates of Q. variabilis and waste PFs were not changed during for their thermal co-pyrolysis. In contrast, the catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of Q. variabilis and waste PFs in Py-GC/MS resulted in the additional aromatics formation, suggesting that the interaction between the pyrolysis intermediates of Q. variabilis and waste PFs over both HY and HZSM-5 leads to the enhanced formation of aromatics. Owing to the higher acidity and proper pore structure of HZSM-5, the CCP of Q. variabilis and waste PFs over HZSM-5 achieved higher aromatic and lower coke formation efficiency than that over HY.
