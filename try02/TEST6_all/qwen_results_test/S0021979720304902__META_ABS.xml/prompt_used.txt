You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reactivity of carbon spheres templated Ce/LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3 in the microwave induced H2O2 catalytic degradation of salicylic acid: Characterization, kinetic and mechanism studies Three-dimensionally (3D) meso-macroporous LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3-supported Ce (xCe/LCCO; x = 0–15 wt%) were prepared by in-situ carbon spheres-templating strategy. Structural and physicochemical properties of the materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and vector network analysis (VNA), and their microwave (MW) catalytic activities towards salicylic acid (SA) degradation were evaluated. It was found that appropriate Ce doping amount (x = 10 wt%) was beneficial for the generation of high-quality 3D meso-macroporous structure, good MW absorbing ability, high active oxygen species concentration and strong interaction between Ce and carbon spheres templated LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3, resulting in the high MW catalytic activity. Significantly, SA degradation efficiency reached 93.8% under optimal conditions with initial pH of 6.0, MW power of 480 W, catalyst dosage of 6.0 g·L−1, H2O2 concentration of 2 mL·L−1 and SA concentration of 10 mg·L−1. The obtained kinetic equation followed the pseudo-first-order model. Radical scavenger measurements indicated that ·OH produced during catalytic degradation process was the dominant active radical. Furthermore, Co, Cu and Ce species were involved in the generation of ·OH, which were responsible to the excellent performance of the catalyst/MW/H2O2 system. The catalyst also showed good reusability and stability. Hence, the catalyst/MW/H2O2 technology has potential application for the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater.
