You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic production of hydrogen and carbon nanotubes from glycerol via Ni2⁺/Zr⁴⁺-doped double-hydroxide layers Well-dispersed NiZrAl catalysts were prepared by thermally decomposing the NiZrAl-layered double hydroxides (LDH) precursor which was in situ assembled on Al2O3 (Al source) surface through a urea homogeneous precipitation-deposition strategy, characterized by XRD, TG, TEM, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, TPR, XPS, H2-chemisorption and Raman techniques. The findings indicated that nickel species were well-dispersed on the support surface. Variation in nickel loading had a more significant influence on the surface chemical state and dispersion. Nickel oxide was only partially reduced to metallic Ni, and larger number and smaller metal particle size of which were more favorable for glycerol cracking. The product distribution was markedly affected by the content of oxygen vacancies, and hydrogen production was enhanced by promoting the water gas shift reaction. The optimal catalytic performance was achieved over the sample 15NiZr@Al2O3 with a glycerol conversion of 92.4 % and a H2 selectivity of 76.7 %. All the catalysts demonstrated good resistance to sintering, and carbon nanotubes were generated as a by-product.
