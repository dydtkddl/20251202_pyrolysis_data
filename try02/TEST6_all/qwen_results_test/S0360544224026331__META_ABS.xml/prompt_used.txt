You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergizing compressed air energy storage and liquefied natural gas regasification in a power-to-biofuels plant The present study is dedicated to the thermodynamic evaluation of an innovative system for the generation of biomethanol and natural gas, utilizing the processes of biomass gasification and high-temperature electrolysis. The recovery of waste heat from a compressed air energy storage (CAES) system serves as a crucial thermal energy source. Recognizing the periodic nature of CAES operations, a thermal energy storage (TES) system has been used to ensure a consistent supply of heat to the biomethanol production facility. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification unit and an open Brayton cycle play a dual role, contributing not only to power generation and natural gas production but also to enhancing biomethanol production through the utilization of flue gases. The results of a thermodynamic modeling conducted within the Aspen Plus program demonstrate the production of 69251 ton/year of natural gas, 1424 ton/year of biomethanol, with a CO2 consumption of 3452 ton/year, resulting in an impressive overall energy efficiency of 95.27 %. The electrolyzer exhibits the highest power consumption at 1035 kW. Sensitivity analysis showed that net input electricity increases with an enhanced number of solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) cells, while biomethanol capacity rises due to enhanced electrolysis size and hydrogen production rate.
