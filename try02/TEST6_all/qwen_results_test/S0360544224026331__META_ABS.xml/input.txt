Synergizing compressed air energy storage and liquefied natural gas regasification in a power-to-biofuels plant The present study is dedicated to the thermodynamic evaluation of an innovative system for the generation of biomethanol and natural gas, utilizing the processes of biomass gasification and high-temperature electrolysis. The recovery of waste heat from a compressed air energy storage (CAES) system serves as a crucial thermal energy source. Recognizing the periodic nature of CAES operations, a thermal energy storage (TES) system has been used to ensure a consistent supply of heat to the biomethanol production facility. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification unit and an open Brayton cycle play a dual role, contributing not only to power generation and natural gas production but also to enhancing biomethanol production through the utilization of flue gases. The results of a thermodynamic modeling conducted within the Aspen Plus program demonstrate the production of 69251 ton/year of natural gas, 1424 ton/year of biomethanol, with a CO2 consumption of 3452 ton/year, resulting in an impressive overall energy efficiency of 95.27 %. The electrolyzer exhibits the highest power consumption at 1035 kW. Sensitivity analysis showed that net input electricity increases with an enhanced number of solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) cells, while biomethanol capacity rises due to enhanced electrolysis size and hydrogen production rate.
