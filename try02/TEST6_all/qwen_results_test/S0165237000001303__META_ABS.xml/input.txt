Comments on the validity and utility of the different methods for kinetic analysis of thermogravimetric data This work deals with the kinetic analysis of data obtained in thermobalance. It consists of a review of kinetic models used for material decomposition, and also of the methods used for the analysis. The topics presented comprise numerical problems related with kinetic analysis, best conditions for a kinetic run, discussion about correlation vs. actual models, nth order models, more complex models (models using a great number of reactions, models using various fractions), calibration of the temperature, position of the thermocouple, sample mass and particle size. Other topics treated are the validation of kinetic models using MS data and the different models available for kinetic studies in thermobalance.
