You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of a novel environmental-friendly lithium-ion battery fire suppression microcapsule and its fire extinguishing mechanism in coordination with ABC dry powder Lithium-ion battery fires are one of the main bottlenecks hindering the industrialization development of lithium-ion batteries. The existing fire extinguishing materials can not completely solve the problems of lithium-ion battery cooling, reignition, pollution and so on. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient and environmentally friendly fire extinguishing materials. In this paper, environmentally friendly CTS-SA@F7A-Novec 1230 microcapsule fire extinguishing agent with good flame retardant properties was prepared by coating heptafluorocyclopentane (F7A) and perfluorohexanone (Novec 1230) fire-extinguishing materials by the complex coalescence method using chitosan (CTS) and sodium alginate (SA) as the shell material, and the fire-extinguishing effects of the three methods, namely, N2+ABC dry powder + microcapsule (NAM), N2+ABC dry powder (NA), and N2(N), were comparatively analyzed. The research results indicate that, CTS-SA@F7A-Novec 1230 microcapsules were well formed and had excellent thermal stability; The peak heat release rate (PHRR) of CTS-SA@F7A-Novec 1230 microcapsules decreased by 22.56 w/g after the addition of CTS-SA@F7A-Novec 1230 microcapsules to the composite battery materials, and the temperature T PHRR corresponding to PHRR increased by 18.09 °C accordingly, which resulted in a good flame retardant property of the materials; The cell cooling effect was ranked as NAM > NA > N, and the maximum cell surface temperatures under these three methods were reduced by 10.34%, 17.30% and 18.68%, respectively, compared with the thermal runaway experimental data; The fire extinguishing effectiveness was ranked as NAM > NA > N. The maximum flame temperature was reduced by 52.10%, 40.53%, and 23.95%, and the flame extinguishing time was shortened by 71.02%, 64.12%, and 22.48%, respectively, with these three methods compared to the thermal runaway flame data. Based on this, the three-phase synergistic extinguishing mechanism of gas, liquid and solid under the NAM method is revealed, which provides an important reference for the design of extinguishing agents and extinguishing methods for lithium-ion batteries.
