Upcycling municipal solid waste to sustainable hydrogen via two-stage gasification-reforming As global municipal solid waste (MSW) quantities continue to escalate, serious socio-environmental challenges arise, necessitating innovative solutions. Waste-to-hydrogen (WTH) via two-stage gasification-reforming (TSGR) presents an emergent technology for MSW upcycling, offering to ease waste management burdens and bolster the burgeoning hydrogen economy. Despite early initiatives to advance TSGR technology, a cohesive and critical analysis of cutting-edge knowledge and strategies to enhance hydrogen production remains lacking. This review aggregates literature on MSW upcycling to hydrogen via TSGR, with a focus on optimizing process control and catalytic efficiency. It underscores technological avenues to augment hydrogen output, curtail catalyst costs, and refine system performance. Particularly, the review illuminates the potential for integrating chemical and calcium looping into TSGR processes, identifying opportunities, and pinpointing challenges. The review concludes with a summary of the current state of techno-economic analysis for this technology, presenting outstanding challenges and future research directions, with the ultimate goal of transitioning WTH from theoretical to practical application.
