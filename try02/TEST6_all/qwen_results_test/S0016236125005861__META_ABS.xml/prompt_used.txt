You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the effect of biochar catalyst on the formation of biomass slow pyrolysis products The use of solid products from biomass pyrolysis as catalysts and the analysis of the generation patterns of catalytic products are of great significance for clean energy production. This paper primarily examines the key role of the physicochemical properties of biochar in reducing tar yield and increasing syngas production. The results show that the rich O-containing functional groups and developed pore structures on the surface of biochar are good for catalyst catalyzed tar reforming for hydrogen production. Among the three biochars, corn stalk biochar has the highest tar conversion efficiency at the catalytic temperature of 800℃. The introduction of biochar catalysts can convert tar into small organic molecules and combustible gases. After catalysis, the amount of O-containing organics in tar is much smaller. The organics containing only C and H, such as naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, are the main organic components. Increasing catalytic temperature or catalyst mass increases tar conversion efficiency and relative content of H2. Activation of the samples with activators KOH and H3PO4 yield catalysts with larger specific surface area, more developed pore structures, richer O-containing functional groups, and higher catalytic activity. Activation with H3PO4 by one step and two step methods obtain a tar conversion efficiency of 72.31% and 70.83%.
