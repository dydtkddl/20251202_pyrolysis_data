Study on the effect of biochar catalyst on the formation of biomass slow pyrolysis products The use of solid products from biomass pyrolysis as catalysts and the analysis of the generation patterns of catalytic products are of great significance for clean energy production. This paper primarily examines the key role of the physicochemical properties of biochar in reducing tar yield and increasing syngas production. The results show that the rich O-containing functional groups and developed pore structures on the surface of biochar are good for catalyst catalyzed tar reforming for hydrogen production. Among the three biochars, corn stalk biochar has the highest tar conversion efficiency at the catalytic temperature of 800℃. The introduction of biochar catalysts can convert tar into small organic molecules and combustible gases. After catalysis, the amount of O-containing organics in tar is much smaller. The organics containing only C and H, such as naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, are the main organic components. Increasing catalytic temperature or catalyst mass increases tar conversion efficiency and relative content of H2. Activation of the samples with activators KOH and H3PO4 yield catalysts with larger specific surface area, more developed pore structures, richer O-containing functional groups, and higher catalytic activity. Activation with H3PO4 by one step and two step methods obtain a tar conversion efficiency of 72.31% and 70.83%.
