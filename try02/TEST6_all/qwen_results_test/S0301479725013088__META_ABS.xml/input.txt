The strategic role of a mild hydrothermal pretreatment in enhancing anaerobic degradation of commercial bio-based compostable plastics associated to food waste The expansion of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) technology to turn food waste (FW) into biogas will influence the management of the associated compostable bio-based plastics disposed of in the organic fraction of municipal waste collection. Waste processing aspects and bio-based plastic biodegradation profile in anaerobic conditions need research. The fate of some commercially available compostable items made of thermoplastic starch or PLA-based blends was investigated, by performing lab-scale disposal phase and thermophilic AD, with the integration of a mild hydrothermal pretreatment. For comprehensive understanding of bio-based plastics degradation, the biomethane production, structural (visual inspection, weight, dimension) and composition changes (solids, organics and carbohydrates content) were analyzed. Thermal pretreatment promoted thermoplastic starch-based product disintegration (40 ± 2 %) and the extraction of carbohydrates into the liquid eluate, with the potential to be transformed into high-value-added products through fermentative upgrading processes. A significant biodegradation of pretreated bio-based plastics up to 27.5 % and 40 %, respectively for thermoplastic starch- and polylactic acid (PLA)-based material, was observed. These preliminary results evidence the strategic role of the hydrothermal pretreatment in enhancing anaerobic degradation and the possibility to treat the bio-based plastics as FW co-substrate, avoiding the time and cost-consuming sorting phase in waste management plants.
