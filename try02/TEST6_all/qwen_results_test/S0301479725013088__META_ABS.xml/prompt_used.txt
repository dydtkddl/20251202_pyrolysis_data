You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The strategic role of a mild hydrothermal pretreatment in enhancing anaerobic degradation of commercial bio-based compostable plastics associated to food waste The expansion of Anaerobic Digestion (AD) technology to turn food waste (FW) into biogas will influence the management of the associated compostable bio-based plastics disposed of in the organic fraction of municipal waste collection. Waste processing aspects and bio-based plastic biodegradation profile in anaerobic conditions need research. The fate of some commercially available compostable items made of thermoplastic starch or PLA-based blends was investigated, by performing lab-scale disposal phase and thermophilic AD, with the integration of a mild hydrothermal pretreatment. For comprehensive understanding of bio-based plastics degradation, the biomethane production, structural (visual inspection, weight, dimension) and composition changes (solids, organics and carbohydrates content) were analyzed. Thermal pretreatment promoted thermoplastic starch-based product disintegration (40 ± 2 %) and the extraction of carbohydrates into the liquid eluate, with the potential to be transformed into high-value-added products through fermentative upgrading processes. A significant biodegradation of pretreated bio-based plastics up to 27.5 % and 40 %, respectively for thermoplastic starch- and polylactic acid (PLA)-based material, was observed. These preliminary results evidence the strategic role of the hydrothermal pretreatment in enhancing anaerobic degradation and the possibility to treat the bio-based plastics as FW co-substrate, avoiding the time and cost-consuming sorting phase in waste management plants.
