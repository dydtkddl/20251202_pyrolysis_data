You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performances of syngas production and deposited coke regulation during co-gasification of biomass and plastic wastes over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst: Role of biomass to plastic ratio in feedstock In order to improve the quality of syngas and regulate the deposited coke, co-gasification of biomass and polyethylene wastes without and with steam were investigated in a bench-scale fixed bed reactor, where the feedstock was pyrolyzed at the temperature of 600 °C followed by catalytic reforming at 800 °C over Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The influences of different biomass to plastic ratios in feedstock on the quality of gas products were analyzed by means of gas chromatography. The as-formed deposited coke was examined by TEM, Raman, FTIR and TPO analysis. The results showed a synergistic effect on both gas and tar yields when PE was co-fed to RH, especially at PE content of 50%. For higher PE content (>50%), the total gas and H2 decreased due to more chain hydrocarbons with relatively large molecular size derived from PE volatiles being more difficult to be cracked than oxygenates from pyrolysis of biomass. Two natures of the deposited coke were identified as amorphous carbon and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). With increasing PE proportion, CNTs growth exhibited a denser distribution with uniform diameter (~18 nm) and longer tube walls extending to a few microns. In the absence of steam, amorphous carbons was the leading type in coke depositions. The introduction of steam improved the quality and purity of CNTs and decreased amorphous carbon remarkably, owning to a stronger interaction between steam and amorphous carbon rather than CNTs with high graphitization, leading to high CNTs proportion of 61.5%. A significant synergistic effect on the CNT growth was observed particularly for 50–75% of PE. The CNT-predominated deposited coke slowed down the deactivation rate of catalysts, thus producing positive impact to total gas production.
