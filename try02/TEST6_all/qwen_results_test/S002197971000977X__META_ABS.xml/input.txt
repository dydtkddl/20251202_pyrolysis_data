Sparsely-distributed silica/PMMA composite particles prepared by static polymerization in aqueous silica dispersion Silica/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composite particles, in which silica particles are sparsely distributed in the surface of PMMA particles, were formed by static dispersion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in aqueous dispersions of submicron silica particles. The silica-modified PMMA particles were constructed via Pickering emulsion-like silica/PMMA aggregation based on weak interaction between PMMA and silica. The morphology of the composite particles is governed by the adsorption/partition equilibrium of PMMA with the silica surface.
