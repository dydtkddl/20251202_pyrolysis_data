You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The future of the cold sintering process: Challenges, opportunities, and innovations The cold sintering process (CSP) has emerged as a groundbreaking alternative to conventional high-temperature sintering methods, enabling the densification of materials at significantly lower temperatures, typically below 400 °C. By utilizing a combination of mechanical pressure, transient liquid phases, and controlled chemical interactions, CSP significantly minimizes energy consumption and preserves the integrity of temperature-sensitive materials, including polymers, nanocomposites, and hybrid systems. This review comprehensively examines the current state of CSP, emphasizing its advantages in energy-efficient manufacturing, material compatibility, and process versatility. Despite its transformative potential, CSP faces several critical challenges, including the need for a deeper understanding of its fundamental mechanisms, process control limitations, scalability constraints, and material-specific densification behaviors. The requirement for post-annealing to remove residual solvents or enhance crystallinity further complicate industrial adoption, as seen in CSP-processed solid-state electrolytes and polymer-ceramic composites. The review explores the role of solvent-mediated mass transport, pressure-assisted diffusion, and interfacial bonding in CSP, highlighting the necessity of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling for optimizing processing parameters. Furthermore, integrating CSP with emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing, biomedical engineering, energy storage, sustainable manufacturing, and advanced electronics presents promising opportunities for expanding its industrial applications. Future research must focus on improving reproducibility, enhancing process automation, and exploring novel material systems compatible with CSP. Addressing these challenges will unlock the full potential of CSP for sustainable, high-performance material fabrication. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and industry professionals, outlining key research directions and innovations required to advance CSP from laboratory-scale development to widespread industrial adoption.
