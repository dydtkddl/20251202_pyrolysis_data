You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Total utilization of waste tire rubber through pyrolysis to obtain oils and CO2 activation of pyrolysis char Waste tire rubber (WTR) was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor in the final temperature range of 500–800°C. Pyrolysis oils were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Pyrolysis chars obtained were activated using CO2 at a final temperature of 950°C with a final activation time of 1–3h. In addition, the influence of the acid treatment of pyrolysis char on the physicochemical properties was investigated. In the experiments, the yields of pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis char were 30–38 and about 37wt.%, respectively. The pyrolysis oils consisted mainly of limonene, aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, and some heteroatom-containing compounds, such as benzothiazole and 2,4-dimethylquinoline. The sulfur contents of the pyrolysis oils were 0.85–0.96wt.%. Most of the sulfur remained in the pyrolysis char. The maximum surface area of the activated char obtained by CO2 activation was 437m2/g. The acid treatment of the pyrolysis char decreased the ash and sulfur contents, which supported the strong potential of the acid-treated char for use in commercial applications.
