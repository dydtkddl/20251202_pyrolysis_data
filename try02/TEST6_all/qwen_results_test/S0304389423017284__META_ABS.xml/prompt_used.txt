You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Defluorination and directional conversion to light fuel by lithium synergistic vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis for electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride in spent lithium-ion batteries To overcome the drawbacks of current recycling technologies and achieve clean utilization of toxic substances in spent lithium-ion batteries, a lithium synergistic vacuum catalytic co-pyrolysis method was proposed to defluorinate electrolyte and polyvinylidene fluoride with directional conversion to light fuel. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry results indicated, compared to the control group, that adding CaO-ZSM-5 catalyst increased the light fuel (alcohols and hydrocarbons) content of the pyrolysis gas from 61.8 % to 91.47 % under the optimal conditions (530 °C and initial pressure of 100 Pa), whereas the total proportion of esters and toxic organic compounds decreased from 32.58 % to 3.99 %. Moreover, the ethylene carbonate and hexanedinitrile content of the electrolyte was enriched to 85 % in the pyrolysis oil. Notably, fluoride was not detected in the pyrolysis oil and gas, achieving a 98.16 % defluorination rate, implying that hazardous waste was transformed to ordinary waste, thereby greatly avoiding toxic emissions to the environment. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data indicated that fluorine was fixed in the form of CaF2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and XRD analysis of the catalytic pyrolysis residue confirmed that nonferrous metals in the cathode material were converted into simple substances and oxides. Finally, possible co-pyrolysis mechanisms of the organic compounds are proposed, including Li+ generation, chain initiation, catalytic pyrolysis, and directional conversion.
