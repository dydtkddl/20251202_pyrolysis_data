You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable coke-resistant Ca-Al nano-sized catalyst for cogenerating hydrogen and high-value liquid fuels via pyrolysis catalytic steam reforming reaction of the polystyrene-phenol mixture The production of synthetic plastics, particularly polystyrene (PS), has had a significant impact on humanity and has led to an increase in global waste. Since conventional treatment methods cannot effectively recycle these materials, this study aimed to find a solution by valorizing polystyrene waste and phenol through an in-situ pyrolysis-catalytic steam reforming reaction utilizing the γ-Al2O3 (Al) and CaO (Ca) nanomaterials for the production of hydrogen and liquid fuel. The catalysts were prepared using impregnation and hydrothermal techniques, and their physicochemical properties were characterized after being calcined and utilized. Among the catalysts used, the 2Ca3Al nanocatalyst had high performance due to its high surface area, uniformly distributed Ca and Al alloy, surface hydroxyl groups, and oxygen vacancies. At 700 oC, the 2Ca3Al nanocatalyst demonstrated a phenol conversion rate and H2 yield of 98.5 % and 92.5 %, respectively. The main compounds detected in the liquid product were tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide (TBH) and Dixanthogen.
