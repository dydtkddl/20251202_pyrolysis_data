Recent progress in additive manufacturing of porous titanium: From design to applications Porous titanium (Ti) alloys have been shown to combine metallic properties with tunable porosity, thus exhibiting advantageous characteristics such as low density, high-temperature stability, and corrosion resistance, which renders them suitable for biomedical and electrochemical applications. Conventional fabrication methods like casting lack precision for complex architectures, whereas Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables their accurate fabrication, driving advances in the field. This article examines the various types of porous Ti alloys suitable for AM and discusses their physicochemical properties. In addition, it provides an in-depth analysis of five key AM processes used in the fabrication of porous Ti, Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electron Beam Melting (EBM), Laser Metal Deposition (LMD), Resonance-Assisted Deposition (RAD), and Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Moreover, the article examines the strategies employed to improve the performance of porous Ti, addressing improvements at the material, structural, and manufacturing process levels. Special attention summarizes the current and potential applications of porous Ti in the biomedical and electrode sectors. Furthermore, by exploring the potential of digital technologies such as machine learning, big data, and digital twins, innovative improvements can be made to the printing processes and material selection in the AM of porous Ti. The goal is to identify the key challenges and prospects of AM technologies for porous Ti, especially in material development and practical applications
