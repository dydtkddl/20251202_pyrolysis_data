You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in additive manufacturing of porous titanium: From design to applications Porous titanium (Ti) alloys have been shown to combine metallic properties with tunable porosity, thus exhibiting advantageous characteristics such as low density, high-temperature stability, and corrosion resistance, which renders them suitable for biomedical and electrochemical applications. Conventional fabrication methods like casting lack precision for complex architectures, whereas Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables their accurate fabrication, driving advances in the field. This article examines the various types of porous Ti alloys suitable for AM and discusses their physicochemical properties. In addition, it provides an in-depth analysis of five key AM processes used in the fabrication of porous Ti, Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Electron Beam Melting (EBM), Laser Metal Deposition (LMD), Resonance-Assisted Deposition (RAD), and Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Moreover, the article examines the strategies employed to improve the performance of porous Ti, addressing improvements at the material, structural, and manufacturing process levels. Special attention summarizes the current and potential applications of porous Ti in the biomedical and electrode sectors. Furthermore, by exploring the potential of digital technologies such as machine learning, big data, and digital twins, innovative improvements can be made to the printing processes and material selection in the AM of porous Ti. The goal is to identify the key challenges and prospects of AM technologies for porous Ti, especially in material development and practical applications
