You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress on waste plastics gasification process: A review of operating conditions, reactors and catalysts for clean syngas production and tar abatement With the continuous increase in global plastic production and the associated challenges in managing plastic and waste plastic, this review provides an overview of the plastic waste issue and explores gasification as a potential solution. The main objective of gasification is to convert selectively waste plastics into synthesis gas (syngas). It is important to highlight that the composition and potential applications of the resulting syngas are largely dependent on the gasifying agent employed. Specifically, steam or oxygen gasification typically yields hydrogen-rich syngas suitable for synthesis processes, whereas air gasification predominantly produces syngas for energy generation. Nonetheless, the applicability of the produced syngas is often constrained by the presence of various contaminants. Among these, the high tar content represents one of the principal limitations of the gasification process. This review examines the impact of key operational parameters and the utilization of various catalysts in the reduction of tar during the gasification of plastics. The results from over 100 experimental trials are summarised, providing a thorough synthesis of recent advancements in the field. Furthermore, the principal gasification strategies and technologies relevant to plastics and plastic waste are explored in detail.
