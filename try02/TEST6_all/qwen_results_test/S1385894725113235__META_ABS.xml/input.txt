Optimization and modeling of reaction conditions for the selective recovery of waxes from HDPE pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed reactor As global plastic production continues to rise, recycling rates keep lagging, leaving vast amounts of plastic waste as an underutilized carbon resource. Developing efficient plastic conversion methods is essential for advancing a sustainable circular economy. While the conversion of polyolefins into fuels and gases has been extensively studied, the production of waxes has received limited attention, despite their potential as value-added products for various industrial applications. This study focuses on the thermal pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene in a conical spouted bed reactor (CSBR), a system known for its high selectivity toward wax production. More specifically, the effects of key process parameters including reaction temperature, nitrogen flow rate, and plastic feeding rate, on wax yield and productivity were systematically investigated. A design of experiments approach was employed to quantify their influence, enabling the development of predictive models. The results indicate that different molecular weight wax fractions can be selectively produced, with reaction temperature being the most influential parameter for wax yield, and plastic feed rate having the greatest impact on wax productivity. Optimized reaction conditions were identified, providing insights into the potential for controlled wax production via thermal pyrolysis. Validation experiments were conducted, yielding over 80 wt% wax and a wax productivity of approximately 148 g.h−1 for the total wax yield. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the capabilities of the CSBR in chemical recycling and highlight its role in producing high-value waxes from plastic waste.
