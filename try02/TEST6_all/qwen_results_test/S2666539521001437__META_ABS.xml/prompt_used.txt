You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High photocatalytic efficiency of inkjet printed patterns by formulation of eco-friendly TiO2-based inks High photocatalytic performances of inkjet printed patterns has been achieved by a green formulation of water-based suspension including commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The reaction rate constant (k > 3.79 × 10−3min−1cm-2) of the manufactured patterns presented competitive photoresponses in comparison with others complex formulations based on sol-gel process. Optimized conditions of the colloidal dispersion and stabilization of TiO 2 NPs using diethylene glycol as cosolvent, allowed a constant and homogeneous jetting flow, fitting the surface tension and viscosity values suitable for the piezo-driven technology selected. The nanostructure-based pattern printed with micro-resolution achieved the 90% methyl orange degradation after 9h of light exposition and the 100% after 13h in a stirred tank reactor. Moreover, the reusability of printed patterns has been also proved since they preserve their photocatalytic activity and microstructure after sequential tests. This new finding is expected to be particularly useful to industrial fabrication of microdesign and immobilized patters onto different substrates-types.
