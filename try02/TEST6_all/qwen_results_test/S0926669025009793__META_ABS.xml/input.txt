Mechanisms and application of wastes-pyrolyzed biochars in soil Cd immobilization, tobacco Cd accumulation reduction and plant growth promotion Tobacco is a typical cadmium (Cd) accumulator, which however, also an important cash crop. Fixing Cd in soils is critical to decrease its phytoavailability and accumulation in tobacco. Biochars were produced by pig manure, cow manure and corn straw (PMB, CMB and CSB) under 350 ℃, 500 ℃ and 700 ℃, and applied to 0.83 or 12 mg kg 1 Cd-spiked soils. The results showed that biochar amendment reduced soil available Cd and tobacco Cd contents by 22.138.9 % and 2.972.6 % in 0.83 mg kg 1 Cd-spiked soils. The reduced soil Cd availability was related to the elevated soil pH (R=-0.36). In addition, biochars promoted tobacco growth (0.835.03 g plant 1 fw). Specifically, PMB500 was the most efficient and outperformed PMB700 in reducing soil Cd availability and plant accumulation. This was attributed to the small pore size (13.6 nm), high OM content (51.6 mg g 1), rich functional groups, and high contents of calcite (CaCO3; 11.5 %), albite (Na(AlSi3O8); 13.6 %), muscovite (KAl2.2(Si3Al)0.975O10(OH)1.72O0.28; 25.5 %), and microcline (K(AlSi3O8); 34.0 %) in PMB500. These features contributed to the efficient surface complexation (OH, COOH and CHO), cation exchange (Ca2+, K+ and Al3+), and precipitation (CdCO3, CdSiO3 and Cd(OH)2) reactions between PMB500 and Cd. This suggested that Cd adsorption efficiency was feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature dependent, but high temperature is not necessarily to produce more efficient biochar. The better understand of structure-performance relationship and materialization mechanism helps to achieve desired biochars to facilitate soil remediation and agronomic application.
