You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanisms and application of wastes-pyrolyzed biochars in soil Cd immobilization, tobacco Cd accumulation reduction and plant growth promotion Tobacco is a typical cadmium (Cd) accumulator, which however, also an important cash crop. Fixing Cd in soils is critical to decrease its phytoavailability and accumulation in tobacco. Biochars were produced by pig manure, cow manure and corn straw (PMB, CMB and CSB) under 350 ℃, 500 ℃ and 700 ℃, and applied to 0.83 or 12 mg kg 1 Cd-spiked soils. The results showed that biochar amendment reduced soil available Cd and tobacco Cd contents by 22.138.9 % and 2.972.6 % in 0.83 mg kg 1 Cd-spiked soils. The reduced soil Cd availability was related to the elevated soil pH (R=-0.36). In addition, biochars promoted tobacco growth (0.835.03 g plant 1 fw). Specifically, PMB500 was the most efficient and outperformed PMB700 in reducing soil Cd availability and plant accumulation. This was attributed to the small pore size (13.6 nm), high OM content (51.6 mg g 1), rich functional groups, and high contents of calcite (CaCO3; 11.5 %), albite (Na(AlSi3O8); 13.6 %), muscovite (KAl2.2(Si3Al)0.975O10(OH)1.72O0.28; 25.5 %), and microcline (K(AlSi3O8); 34.0 %) in PMB500. These features contributed to the efficient surface complexation (OH, COOH and CHO), cation exchange (Ca2+, K+ and Al3+), and precipitation (CdCO3, CdSiO3 and Cd(OH)2) reactions between PMB500 and Cd. This suggested that Cd adsorption efficiency was feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature dependent, but high temperature is not necessarily to produce more efficient biochar. The better understand of structure-performance relationship and materialization mechanism helps to achieve desired biochars to facilitate soil remediation and agronomic application.
