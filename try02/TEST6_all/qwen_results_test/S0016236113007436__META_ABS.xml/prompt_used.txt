You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation on coal devolatilization at high temperatures with different heating rates Experiments were carried out in a drop tube furnace and a lab-scale plasma reactor to investigate the effects of coal properties, particle ultimate temperature and heating rate (i.e., 10−1 to 101 K/s for slow pyrolysis, 102 to 104 K/s for fast pyrolysis and 104 to 106 K/s for rapid plasma pyrolysis processes) on coal devolatilization performances. The results revealed that fast pyrolysis of coal would greatly increase the yield of light gases compared to slow pyrolysis process. The increased yield of light gases strongly depended on the coal rank and mainly came from the secondary tar cracking reactions. The comparisons of slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis and rapid plasma pyrolysis processes indicated that the major effect of the increased heating rate was to raise the carbon conversion to light gases and then greatly increase the yields of gaseous hydrocarbons correspondingly. In addition, fast pyrolysis behaved much closer to plasma pyrolysis for the coals with the volatile matter content higher than 37%. Therefore, understanding on the fast pyrolysis in a drop tube furnace could help to provide a simple, quick method for preliminary selection of coal rank for plasma pyrolysis process. Finally, a comprehensive single-particle heat transfer mechanism model was established to further discover the effect of heating rate on coal devolatilization and to improve the accuracy of the proposed coal rank selection method.
