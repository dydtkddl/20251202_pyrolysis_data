Recent progress on catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and lignocellulosic biomass to liquid fuel: The influence of technical and reaction kinetic parameters Discharge of non-biodegradable plastic waste and lignocellulosic biomass into the environment, and the resultant pollution has persistently increased all over the globe. This activity poses a threat not only to mankind, but also to the environment. In addressing this challenge, catalytic co-pyrolysis (CCP) of plastic waste and lignocellulosic biomass is one of the attractive ways used to reduce these types of waste, while simultaneously obtaining an alternative for conventional fossil fuel. This article has critically reviewed the literature on CCP in several areas, especially the impact of technical parameters, such as heating systems, experimental conditions, and synergistic effect of the CCP of plastic and biomass wastes. The kinetics and reaction pathways of CCP of plastic and biomass wastes are also discussed. The analysis and information presented in this review may be used in future studies to develop a sustainable and efficient heating processes in pyrolysis system to re-engineer plastic and biomass wastes.
