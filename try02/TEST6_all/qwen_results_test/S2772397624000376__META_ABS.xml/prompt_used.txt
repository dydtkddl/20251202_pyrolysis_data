You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient and environmentally friendly techniques for extracting lignin from lignocellulose biomass and subsequent uses: A review The development of sustainable and effective methods for extracting lignin is crucial for achieving the advantages and promoting the shift towards a more sustainable and circular bioeconomy. This study addresses the use of environmentally friendly processes, including organosolv technique, supercritical fluid (SCF), non-thermal plasma (NTP), ionic liquids (ILs), deep eutectic solvents (DES), and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) techniques for lignin extraction. Organosolv treatment offers high selectivity and purity of lignin make this process economically feasible. Using supercritical water, carbon dioxide, or ethanol to extract lignin without harmful solvents is successful and customizable. NTP technologies break down lignin, simplifying processing and increasing its value. Whereas ILs may boost lignin synthesis and change its properties via solvent design. DES-based extraction methods can efficiently and specifically extract lignin. The rapid and effective MAE method employs microwave radiation to reduce extraction times and boost yields for lignin extraction. These methods feature high selectivity, little environmental impact, and the capacity to target lignin fractions. The study describes the fundamentals, benefits, and drawbacks of each extraction process, focusing on their ability to extract lignin on a large scale and its future usage. Additionally, this review explores the most recent advancements in the application sector, as well as the challenges and potential advantages of valorizing streams derived from extraction, thereby fostering the development of environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions. This research concludes that to overcome future challenges, need to address scale concerns, cost, emissions, and efficient lignin use.
