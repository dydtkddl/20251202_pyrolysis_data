You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of hydrogen-rich fuel gas from waste plastics using continuous plasma pyrolysis reactor There is a serious concern about the large amount of accumulated plastic waste all around the world. Synthetic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE) are substantially present in the plastic waste generated. There are various methods reported to minimise such plastics waste with certain limitations. To overcome such limitations the present study have been carried out in which thermal decomposition of plastic waste of PET, PP, HDPE, and LDPE studied using a novel plasma pyrolysis reactor. The major objective of this work is to investigate the viability of the continuous plasma pyrolysis process for the treatment of various plastic wastes with respect to waste volume reduction and production of combustible hydrogen-rich fuel gas. The effect of temperature and feed flow rate on product gas yield, product gas efficiency, solid residue yield, and H2/CO ratio has been evaluated. The experiments have been carried out at different temperatures within the range of 700–1000 °C. Plasma pyrolysis system exhibited combustible hydrogen-rich gas as a product and solid residue. Liquid products have not been observed during plasma pyrolysis, unlike conventional pyrolysis. The reaction mechanism of plastic cracking has been discussed based on literature and products obtained in the present work. The effects of feed flow rate and temperature on exergy efficiency were studied using the response surface method. The mass, energy, and exergy analyses have also been carried out for all the experiments, which are in the range of 0.95–0.99, 0.48 to 0.77, and 0.30 to 0.69, respectively.
