Converting polystyrene waste into valuable oils: high performance of SUZ-4 zeolite for selective oil component conversion in catalytic pyrolysis The increasing concern over plastic waste disposal has led researchers to explore sustainable methods for converting waste into valuable products. This study investigates the catalytic pyrolysis of polystyrene waste (PSW) using SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. SUZ-4 is synthesized from agricultural waste (rice husk), making it a more sustainable option. Results indicate that catalytic pyrolysis with SUZ-4 at a PSW-to-catalyst ratio of 1:0.033 at 350 °C produces an oil yield of 81.60 ± 1.62 %, containing 49.34 % styrene and 21.22 % α-methylstyrene. Under the same conditions, ZSM-5 yields 77.73 ± 1.24 % oil, with 33.18 % styrene and 18.58 % α-methylstyrene. In comparison, non-catalytic pyrolysis at 400 °C results in a 74.23 ± 1.25 % oil yield. These findings demonstrate that the type of catalyst significantly influences product distribution. Both SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolites have 10-membered ring pore systems, but their structural and acidic properties lead to different catalytic behaviors. SUZ-4’s weaker Brønsted acid sites limit excessive secondary cracking, enabling selective cracking. In contrast, ZSM-5 zeolite has stronger Brønsted acid sites and an open, interconnected pore network, which promotes deeper cracking and aromatization, resulting in many types of aromatic compounds in the oil products. Catalytic pyrolysis also reduces the viscosity of the oil compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Differences in chemical composition also affect fuel properties such as heating value, pH, and color. Overall, catalytic pyrolysis offers advantages in terms of higher oil yield and lower operating temperatures. However, differences in catalyst type significantly impact oil composition, which in turn affects fuel quality.
