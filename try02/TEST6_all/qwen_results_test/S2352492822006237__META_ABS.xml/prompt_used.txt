You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ceramic-based nanocomposites: A perspective from carbonaceous nanofillers To overcome the inherent brittle nature of ceramics and to optimize their favorable properties, new design philosophies and novel concepts for manufacturing are needed. Owing to their distinguished mechanical attributes such as strength and stiffness, developing ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) has become the latest penchant for researchers. CMCs are traditionally fibers dispersed in a ceramic matrix (oxide or non-oxide). With the advent of nanoparticles, the probing interests in the field of CMCs are now transforming from traditional reinforcement media (microscale fillers) into new possibilities at the nanoscale. This has brought a new generation of CMCs at nanometric level, commonly known as ceramic matrix nanocomposites (CMNCs). Introduction of nanomaterials like graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as nano-reinforcements has modified the ceramic-structures at the nanometric level for advanced applications in fields such as automotive, industrial, and aerospace engineering. Lately, a variety of new strategies such as tuning in the presence of dopants, opting pristine dispersion routes and usage of modified sintering techniques have enhanced the distinctive features of the CMNCs. This work summarizes the ongoing advances, recent research, key challenges in the implementation of carbonaceous CMNCs reinforced with graphene and CNTs along with their applications and future prospects. A detailed discussion on the sintering techniques, tribological behavior, strengthening and toughening mechanisms of carbonaceous CMNCs is presented. Various advantages of CMNCs reinforced with graphene and CNTs along with a few drawbacks like the cost and process-limitations have been elaborated.
