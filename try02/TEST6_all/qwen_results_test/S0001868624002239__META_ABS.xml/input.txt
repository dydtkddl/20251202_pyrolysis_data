Recent advancement in LaFeO3-mediated systems towards photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction: A comprehensive review The present disrupted scenario of the world calls for urgent attention to the need for renewable resources as an energy source for harnessing and feeding uninterrupted power supply to mankind. Amidst this, Photocatalysis (PC) and Photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) are some of the most budding methods of exploiting solar energy. LaFeO3-based systems are eligible for PC/PEC Hydrogen (H2) generation, incorporating the process of water splitting, etc. It would be fair to mention that the above methods can mimic the natural process of photosynthesis. This review comprises an encyclopedia of recent advancements in LaFeO3 and modified systems towards sustainable Photocatalytic and Photoelectrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions (HER). Besides the challenges, the review presents a clear and brief idea for the scientific research community on paving the future in upscaling and industrializing the LaFeO3-mediated green fuel (H2) generation to meet global energy needs.
