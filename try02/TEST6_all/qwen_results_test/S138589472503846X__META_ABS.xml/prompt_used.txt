You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable fabrication of porous bio-based polyurethane as triboelectric material realized by dynamic bond and scN2 foaming The escalating global energy crisis and environmental challenges are driving advancements in innovative energy harvesting technologies. Among these triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted much attention due to their vigorous conversion capabilities for mechanical energy. However, traditional triboelectric materials are still plagued by recyclability, environmental protection and durability. Herein, the dynamic Schiff base chain extender was copolymerized with bio-based polyols and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) through a one-pot synthesis process, and the high bio-based polyurethane (PU) material containing dynamic imine bonds was successfully obtained. Whereafter, combined with supercritical nitrogen (ScN2) foaming, porous PU foam with three-dimensional interpenetrating network structure was prepared. The introduction of dynamic imine bonds gives the material excellent self-healing properties (96.2 % recovery rate after 6 h at 80 °C) and recyclable processability (65.7 % retention of mechanical properties after two recycling cycles). Finally, a single electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG) was constructed by introducing a conductive network into the bio-based PU matrix. The optimum S-TENG displays excellent triboelectric output, that open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) reach 161 V and 151.3nA, respectively. Moreover, it still holds good self-healing and recovery/reprocessing capabilities. This research combines bio-based chemical design, dynamic network engineering and micro-structure regulation to provide innovative solutions for the sustainable development of flexible triboelectric materials and devices.
