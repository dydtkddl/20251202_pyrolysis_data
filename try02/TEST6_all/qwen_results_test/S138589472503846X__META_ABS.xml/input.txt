Sustainable fabrication of porous bio-based polyurethane as triboelectric material realized by dynamic bond and scN2 foaming The escalating global energy crisis and environmental challenges are driving advancements in innovative energy harvesting technologies. Among these triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted much attention due to their vigorous conversion capabilities for mechanical energy. However, traditional triboelectric materials are still plagued by recyclability, environmental protection and durability. Herein, the dynamic Schiff base chain extender was copolymerized with bio-based polyols and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) through a one-pot synthesis process, and the high bio-based polyurethane (PU) material containing dynamic imine bonds was successfully obtained. Whereafter, combined with supercritical nitrogen (ScN2) foaming, porous PU foam with three-dimensional interpenetrating network structure was prepared. The introduction of dynamic imine bonds gives the material excellent self-healing properties (96.2 % recovery rate after 6 h at 80 °C) and recyclable processability (65.7 % retention of mechanical properties after two recycling cycles). Finally, a single electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG) was constructed by introducing a conductive network into the bio-based PU matrix. The optimum S-TENG displays excellent triboelectric output, that open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) reach 161 V and 151.3nA, respectively. Moreover, it still holds good self-healing and recovery/reprocessing capabilities. This research combines bio-based chemical design, dynamic network engineering and micro-structure regulation to provide innovative solutions for the sustainable development of flexible triboelectric materials and devices.
