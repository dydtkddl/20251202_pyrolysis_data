RETRACTED: Combined effect of composite additive and combustion chamber modification to adapt waste plastic oil as fuel on a diesel engine This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal). This article has been retracted at the request of Editor-in-Chief and the society committee. Most of the graphical abstract and Figure 1b of the article have been reused from figures of the already published papers by other authors: “Pooled effect of injection pressure and turbulence inducer piston on performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of a DI diesel engine powered with biodiesel blend” [Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety Volume 134, Part 2, December 2016, Pages 336-343] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.08.020 and “Combined influence of injection timing and EGR on combustion, performance and emissions of DI diesel engine fueled with neat waste plastic oil” [Energy Conversion and Management Volume 161, 1 April 2018, Pages 294-305] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.045. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that their work is original and has not appeared in a publication elsewhere. Re-use of any data should be appropriately cited. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.
