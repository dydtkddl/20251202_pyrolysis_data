You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic coupling Co3Fe7 alloy and CoFe2O4 spinel for highly efficient removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol by activating peroxymonosulfate Efficient wastewater restoration depends on the robustness and capability of the catalyst to promote sophisticated decontamination technologies. In this study, Co3Fe7–CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by facile pyrolysis were completely characterized and used to decompose 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). Furthermore, the catalytic performance and relevant mechanisms involved in the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) were also investigated. The optimal conditions were achieved at the catalyst loading of 0.05 g L−1, PMS dosage of 1.26 g L−1, and pH of 7.7 through the response surface methodology by using the Box–Behnken design model. Under optimal conditions, 97.1% efficiency of 2,4-DCP removal was obtained within 30 min. Moreover, the quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance result indicated that sulfate (SO4 •−) and hydroxyl (HO•) radicals were considered as the dominant reactive oxygen species, which resulted in the effective removal of 2,4-DCP in the Co3Fe7-CoFe2O4/PMS system. Moreover, Co3Fe7-CoFe2O4 showed efficient catalytic performance in continuous five runs and exhibited less metal leaching of 0.052 and 0.036 mg L−1 for Co and Fe species, respectively. Furthermore, no considerable change was observed in the structural characteristics of the fresh and used Co3Fe7–CoFe2O4 catalytic system. The above-mentioned results indicated that the synergistic effects between Co3Fe7 alloy and CoFe2O4 spinel not only significantly improved the activity and long-term durability of the catalyst, but also accelerated the Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycles. Overall, the Co3Fe7–CoFe2O4/PMS system provides a novel advanced oxidation approach to further develop multifunctional transition metal-based nanomaterials responsible for producing surface-bound radicals and enhancing the remediation of refractory pollutants in the environmental application.
