You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of carbon nanotubes via catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst: The influence of plastic types Thermochemical conversion is a promising technology to convert waste plastics into high-value chemicals from both an economic and environmental point of view. In this work, the production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from catalytic pyrolysis of different types waste plastics over Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were used as raw material. The results show that PS showed a higher solid carbon yield of 32.24 wt%. PE waste plastic led to the lowest liquid yield and the highest gas yield, which were 28.95 wt% and 39.45 wt%, respectively. In terms of obtained CNTs, PE and PP plastics obtained more high-purity, structured and intertwined multi-wall carbon nanotubes, while PS produced more amorphous carbon. PET plastic had high oxygen content, which was not conducive to the growth of CNTs during the pyrolysis process. In summary, PE and PP plastics were suitable as feedstock for the preparation of high-quality CNTs by pyrolysis catalysis. The work provides basic data support for the research of the production of valuable CNTs from waste plastics.
