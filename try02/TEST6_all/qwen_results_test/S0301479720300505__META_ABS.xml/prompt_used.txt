You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of waste plastics under non-sweeping atmosphere: Part 2: Effect of process temperature on product characteristics and their future applications The current energy demand and diminishing conventional fuels have forced researchers to find an alternative source of energy. Waste to energy is the current trend for converting waste materials (plastic waste) into valuable fuels. This article mainly discussed the detailed characterization of the pyrolytic products, their comparative analysis and the reaction mechanism at varying operating temperature. This article is a successor of part 1, which primarily focused on the characterization of different waste plastics, their TG analysis, the effect of reactor temperature on yield analysis in a batch reactor and their detailed degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the results presented in this article report the characterization of products at three processing temperatures of 450, 500 and 550 °C. The pyrolytic oils from all wastes excluding PS show a very low density ranging from 0.71 to 0.76 kg/m3, whereas PS pyrolytic density is reported between 0.86 and 0.88 kg/m3. The viscosity of oils increases with an increase in the processing temperature and is similar to the conventional fuels. The FTIR analysis of the products (oil & gases) obtained from HDPE, PP and mixed plastic waste (MIX) shows a large presence of alkanes and a higher presence of aromatics. PS analysis reported a large presence of aromatics (~75%). The GC-MS analysis of all pyrolytic oils from waste plastics, simulated wastes (virgin plastics) and distilled fraction of MIX pyrolysis oil is compared. The GC analysis of non-condensable gases at all processing temperature reports that MIX produce the maximum H2; HDPE, PS and MIX produces a high amounts of CH4 too. The formation of lower hydrocarbons (C5–C12) in pyrolysis oil shows a trend as MIX > PP > PS > HDPE, while for the heavier hydrocarbons (>C19) it is HDPE > PP > PS > MIX. The potential of the utilization of these products has been discussed in different sectors for future research.
