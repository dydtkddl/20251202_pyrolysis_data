Rapid infrared co-pyrolysis performance of corn stover and polyurethane foam waste for upgrading oil yield and quality Rapid infrared heating has been proved efficient for investigating co-pyrolysis synergy by eliminating temperature gradients. This study investigated the co-pyrolysis behaviors and synergistic effects of polyurethane foam (PUF) and corn stover (CS) at various temperatures and blending ratios in an infrared heating reactor. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and iso-conversional methods revealed that the inclusion of CS in PUF pyrolysis reduced the activation energy and promoted synergy across a wide range of temperatures and compositions. The Criado method showed that the co-pyrolysis mechanism corresponded to the Fn reaction model. The experimental results indicated that the oil yield exhibited a trend of initial increase followed by a decrease, peaking at 36.97 % at 600 °C. During the co-pyrolysis process with a 15 % CS ratio, the oil yield exhibited a maximum positive synergistic effect of 2.35 % and CO2 yield displayed a minimal yield of 17.61 %. GC-MS results demonstrated that co-pyrolyzing CS with PUF significantly reduced nitrogenous compounds in the oil, with a 21.19 % reduction observed when the CS ratio exceeded 10 %. FTIR analysis indicated that higher temperatures favored the breakdown of aromatic and aliphatic structures. These findings implied that the co-pyrolysis of PUF and CS under infrared heating not only enhanced oil yield and fuel quality but also offered a promising pathway for the sustainable disposal of plastic and agricultural waste. This approach can contribute to cleaner bio-oil production and more efficient waste-to-energy conversion technologies.
