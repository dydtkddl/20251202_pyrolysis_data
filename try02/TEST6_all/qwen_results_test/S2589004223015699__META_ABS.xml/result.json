  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on catalytic depolymerization of PET using oxygen-assisted defect-rich ZnO, but lacks experimental data from pyrolysis reactors or measurable product yields under thermal conditions, and relies heavily on DFT calculations and theoretical analysis."
