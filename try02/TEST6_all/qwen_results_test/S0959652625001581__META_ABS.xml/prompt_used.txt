You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of biochar derived from rice straw in petroleum bitumen: Agricultural waste recycling and pavement sustainability The production of biochar by rice straw pyrolysis for application in petroleum bitumen is a mutually beneficial practice for sustainable waste management in agriculture and green development of highway industry. In this study, a systematic investigation was carried out, including the fast pyrolysis of rice straw, microscopic and macroscopic characterizations of biochar, performance evaluation of bitumen, and analysis of comprehensive benefits. The test and analysis results show that pyrolysis temperature is the key factor affecting the yield and residual rate of biochar. The biochar has a fibrous and porous structure with a complex surface texture, which is conducive to sufficient physiochemical interaction with bitumen. Compared with base bitumen, biochar modified bitumen has better rutting resistance, anti-aging performance, and temperature susceptibility. The biochar from separators achieves the most significant performance enhancement, with a relatively minor impact on the thermal cracking resistance of bitumen. Quantitatively, the high-temperature performance improves by 222.7%, while the low-temperature performance weakens by only 25.9%. Moreover, recycling rice straw in petroleum bitumen can also create great benefits to economy, environment, and society.
