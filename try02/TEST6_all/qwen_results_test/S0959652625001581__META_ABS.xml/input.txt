Utilization of biochar derived from rice straw in petroleum bitumen: Agricultural waste recycling and pavement sustainability The production of biochar by rice straw pyrolysis for application in petroleum bitumen is a mutually beneficial practice for sustainable waste management in agriculture and green development of highway industry. In this study, a systematic investigation was carried out, including the fast pyrolysis of rice straw, microscopic and macroscopic characterizations of biochar, performance evaluation of bitumen, and analysis of comprehensive benefits. The test and analysis results show that pyrolysis temperature is the key factor affecting the yield and residual rate of biochar. The biochar has a fibrous and porous structure with a complex surface texture, which is conducive to sufficient physiochemical interaction with bitumen. Compared with base bitumen, biochar modified bitumen has better rutting resistance, anti-aging performance, and temperature susceptibility. The biochar from separators achieves the most significant performance enhancement, with a relatively minor impact on the thermal cracking resistance of bitumen. Quantitatively, the high-temperature performance improves by 222.7%, while the low-temperature performance weakens by only 25.9%. Moreover, recycling rice straw in petroleum bitumen can also create great benefits to economy, environment, and society.
