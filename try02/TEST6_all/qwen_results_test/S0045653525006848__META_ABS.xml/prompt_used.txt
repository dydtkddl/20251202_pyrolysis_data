You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Anaerobic co-digestion of HDPE plastics with fruit and vegetable waste: Insights into partial biodegradation and organic waste valorization The global accumulation of HDPE waste poses significant environmental challenges due to its recalcitrant nature and resistance to degradation. Biological treatment methods, particularly anaerobic digestion, offer a sustainable alternative for mitigating plastic pollution while recovering energy in the form of biogas. This study investigates the co-digestion of HDPE plastics with fruit and vegetable waste using a two-stage anaerobic digestion system in batch mode. The process was evaluated for its potential to facilitate HDPE biodegradation while maintaining overall digester performance. Results showed that although methane production was affected by maximum 19.57 % decrease, the system exhibited stable operation without signs of inhibition. Notably, HDPE biodegradation was evidenced by mass losses of 14.02 % for pellets and 17.7 % for waste plastics. SEM analysis revealed surface morphological changes in the HDPE samples, while FTIR confirmed functional group modifications, supporting the observed degradation. Microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing identified Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria as dominant phyla involved in the hydrolysis stage. A carbon mass balance analysis further elucidated carbon flow and transformation within the system. This study highlights the potential of anaerobic co-digestion as an integrated approach for partial HDPE biodegradation and organic waste valorization, paving the way for future optimization strategies.
