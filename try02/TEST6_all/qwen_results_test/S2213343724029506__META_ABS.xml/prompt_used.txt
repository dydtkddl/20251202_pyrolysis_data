You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Entrained-flow gasification characteristics of plastic waste pyrolysis oil Plastic waste (PW) pyrolysis is a promising method in chemical recycling technology; however, PW pyrolysis oil cannot be used directly because of its high contaminant content. Entrained-flow gasification (EFG) is a suitable method for removing contaminants from pyrolysis oil and enhancing the conversion compared with fixed bed or fluidized bed gasification. We examined the basic characteristics of PW pyrolysis oil through EFG with the variation of O2/fuel ratios from 0.6 to 1.4 and steam/fuel ratio from 0.4 to 0.7 at 600–900°C in a lab-scale reactor. The H2 composition and Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) showed the highest when the O2/fuel ratio was 0.8. The Carbon Conversion Efficiency (CCE) showed the highest values when the ratio was 1.4. C2-C3 gases tended to decrease at higher temperatures because of the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. In the experiments with the variation of steam/fuel ratio, CO2 concentration decreased with increasing temperature from 600 to 800°C because of the reverse water-gas-shift reaction. The residence time was calculated to review the reaction conditions and was found to be 4.2–7.3 seconds. The experimental data from a lab-scale EFG can serve as fundamental data for the scale-up of integrated pyrolysis and gasification systems.
